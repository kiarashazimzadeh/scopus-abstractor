0,2-s2.0-85127375931,MR volumetry in detection of brain atrophic changes in MS patients and its implication on disease prognosis: retrospective study,"<p>Background: Multiple sclerosis is a chronic demyelinating disease of the central nervous system. It may lead to disability and cognitive impairment. Our study aimed at evaluation of the role of MR volumetry technique in detection of brain atrophic changes in patients with multiple sclerosis and its impact on disease prognosis. Results: This study was carried out on thirty healthy control with mean age 26.23 years and thirty patients with remitting relapsing multiple sclerosis, with a mean age of 28.18 years. Patients with multiple sclerosis were distributed across six subgroups based on the z-score cut-off of − 1.96 for regional and whole brain atrophy. We found that 2 patients (6.6%) showed no thalamic or brain atrophy, 28 patients (93.3%) showed whole brain atrophy only and 10 patients (33.3%) showed both, thalamic and BP atrophy. No patients showed only thalamic atrohy, 4 patients showed whole brain atrophy with other structure atrophy rather than thalamus (13.3%), 10 patients with whole brain and more than one structure atrophy (33.3%). Relation between subgroups and degree of increase in the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) as well as presence of cognitive decline were assessed. No significant relation were found between RRMS patients subgroups with whole brain atrophy, subgroup with isolated thalamic atrophy or subgroup with multiple structure atrophy and increase of EDSS or cognitive decline. Conclusion: We found that MRI volumetry is a very useful technique in the assessment of the atrophic changes that occur as a consequence of multiple sclerosis affecting the whole brain, deep grey matter as well as corpus callosum. Although our study did not prove significant relation between presence of brain atrophic changes and disability or cognitive impairment, presence of atrophy warrants careful clinical evaluation of those patients to detect any possible further progression of disability or cognitive decline. © 2022, The Author(s).</p>"
1,2-s2.0-85124238043,Neuroradiological differentiation of white matter lesions in patients with multiple sclerosis and Fabry disease,"<p>Objective: White matter lesions (WML) in multiple sclerosis (MS) differ from vascular WML caused by Fabry disease (FD). However, in atypical cases the discrimination can be difficult and may vary between individual raters. The aim of this study was to evaluate interrater reliability of WML differentiation between MS and FD patients. Materials and methods: Brain MRI scans of 21 patients with genetically confirmed FD were compared to 21 matched patients with MS. Pseudonymized axial FLAIR sequences were assessed by 6 blinded raters and attributed to either the MS or the FD group to investigate interrater reliability. Additionally, localization of WML was compared between the two groups. Results: The median age of patients was 46 years (IQR 35–58). Interrater reliability was moderate with a Fleiss' Kappa of 0.45 (95%CI 0.3–0.59). Overall, 85% of all ratings in the MS group and 75% in the FD group were correct. However, only 38% of patients with MS and 33% of patients with FD were correctly identified by all 6 raters. WML involving the corpus callosum (p &lt; 0.001) as well as juxtacortical (p &lt; 0.001) and infratentorial lesions (p = 0.03) were more frequently observed in MS patients. Conclusion: Interrater reliability regarding visual differentiation of WML in MS from vascular WML in FD on standard axial FLAIR images alone is only moderate, despite the distinctive features of lesions in each group. © 2022, The Author(s).</p>"
2,2-s2.0-85125650520,Ceramide kinase knockout ameliorates multiple sclerosis-like behaviors and demyelination in cuprizone-treated mice,"<p>Changes in sphingolipid metabolism regulate and/or alter many cellular functions in the brain. Ceramide, a central molecule of sphingolipid metabolism, is phosphorylated to ceramide-1-phosphate (C1P) by ceramide kinase (CerK). CerK and C1P were reported to regulate many cellular responses, but their roles in immune-related diseases in vivo have not been well elucidated. Thus, we investigated the effects of CerK knockout on the onset/progression of multiple sclerosis (MS), which is a chronic neurodegenerative disease accompanied by the loss of myelin sheaths in the brain. MS-model mice were prepared using a diet containing the copper chelator cuprizone (CPZ). Treatment of 8-week-old mice with 0.2% CPZ for 8 weeks resulted in motor dysfunction based on the Rota-rod test, and caused the loss of myelin-related proteins (MRPs) in the brain and demyelination in the corpus callosum without affecting synaptophysin levels. CerK knockout, which did not affect developmental changes in MRPs, ameliorated the motor dysfunction, loss of MRPs, and demyelination in the brain in CPZ-treated mice. Loss of tail tonus, another marker of motor dysfunction, was detected at 1 week without demyelination after CPZ treatment in a CerK knockout-independent manner. CPZ-induced loss of tail tonus progressed, specifically in female mice, to 6–8 weeks, and the loss was ameliorated by CerK knockout. Activities of ceramide metabolic enzymes including CerK in the lysates of the brain were not affected by CPZ treatment. Inhibition of CerK as a candidate for MS treatment was discussed. © 2022</p>"

Here, we report on 17 previously unpublished patients carrying HNRNPU pathogenic variants. All patients were found to harbor de novo loss-of-function variants except for one individual where the inheritance could not be determined, as a parent was unavailable for testing. All patients had seizures which started in early childhood, global developmental delay, intellectual disability, and dysmorphic features. In addition, hypotonia, behavioral abnormalities (such as autistic features, aggression, anxiety, and obsessive–compulsive behaviors), and cardiac (septal defects) and/or brain abnormalities (ventriculomegaly and corpus callosum thinning/agenesis) were frequently observed. We have noted four recurrent variants in the literature (c.1089G&gt;A p.(Trp363*), c.706_707del p.(Glu236Thrfs*6), c.847_857del p.(Phe283Serfs*5), and c.1681dels p.(Gln561Serfs*45)). © 2022 The Authors.

4,2-s2.0-85116499252,"Correlations between hippocampal functional connectivity, structural changes, and clinical data in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis: A case-control study using multimodal magnetic resonance imaging","<p>Multiple sclerosis is associated with structural and functional brain alterations leading to cognitive impairments across multiple domains including attention, memory, and the speed of information processing. The hippocampus, which is a brain important structure involved in memory, undergoes microstructural changes in the early stage of multiple sclerosis. In this study, we analyzed hippocampal function and structure in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis and explored correlations between the functional connectivity of the hippocampus to the whole brain, changes in local brain function and microstructure, and cognitive function at rest. We retrospectively analyzed data from 20 relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis patients admitted to the Department of Neurology at the China-Japan Union Hospital of Jilin University, China, from April 2015 to November 2019. Sixteen healthy volunteers were recruited as the healthy control group. All participants were evaluated using a scale of extended disability status and the Montreal cognitive assessment within 1 week before and after head diffusion tensor imaging and functional magnetic resonance imaging. Compared with the healthy control group, the patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis had lower Montreal cognitive assessment scores and regions of simultaneously enhanced and attenuated whole-brain functional connectivity and local functional connectivity in the bilateral hippocampus. Hippocampal diffusion tensor imaging data showed that, compared with the healthy control group, patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis had lower hippocampal fractional anisotropy values and higher mean diffusivity values, suggesting abnormal hippocampal structure. The left hippocampus whole-brain functional connectivity was negatively correlated with the Montreal cognitive assessment score (r =-0.698, P = 0.025), and whole-brain functional connectivity of the right hippocampus was negatively correlated with extended disability status scale score (r =-0.649, P = 0.042). The mean diffusivity value of the left hippocampus was negatively correlated with the Montreal cognitive assessment score (r =-0.729, P = 0.017) and positively correlated with the extended disability status scale score (r = 0.653, P = 0.041). The right hippocampal mean diffusivity value was positively correlated with the extended disability status scale score (r = 0.684, P = 0.029). These data suggest that the functional connectivity and presence of structural abnormalities in the hippocampus in patients with relapse-remission multiple sclerosis are correlated with the degree of cognitive function and extent of disability.

5,2-s2.0-85123731842,Abnormal oxidative metabolism in the cuprizone mouse model of demyelination: An in vivo NIRS-MRI study,"<p>Disruptions in oxidative metabolism may occur in multiple sclerosis and other demyelinating neurological diseases. The impact of demyelination on metabolic rate is also not understood. It is possible that mitochondrial damage may be associated with many such neurological disorders. To study oxidative metabolism with one model of demyelination, we implemented a novel multimodal imaging technique combining Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) and MRI to cuprizone mouse model. The cuprizone model is used to study demyelination and may be associated with inhibition of mitochondrial function. Cuprizone mice showed reduced oxygen extraction fraction (−39.1%, p ≤ 0.001), increased tissue oxygenation (6.4%, p ≤ 0.001), and reduced cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen in cortical gray matter (−62.1%, p ≤ 0.001). These changes resolved after the cessation of cuprizone exposure and partial remyelination. A decrease in hemoglobin concentration (−34.4%, p ≤ 0.001), but no change in cerebral blood flow were also observed during demyelination. The oxidized state of the mitochondrial enzyme, Cytochrome C Oxidase (CCO) increased (46.3%, p ≤ 0.001) while the reduced state decreased (−34.4%, p ≤ 0.05) significantly in cuprizone mice. The total amount of CCO did not change significantly during cuprizone exposure. Total CCO did decline after recovery both in control (−23.1%, p ≤ 0.01) and cuprizone (−28.8%, p ≤ 0.001) groups which may relate to age. A reduction in the magnetization transfer ratio, indicating demyelination, was found in the cuprizone group in the cerebral cortex (−3.2%, p ≤ 0.01) and corpus callosum (−5.5%, p ≤ 0.001). In summary, we were able to detect evidence of altered CCO metabolism during cuprizone exposure, consistent with a mitochondrial defect. We observed increased oxygenation and reduced metabolic rate associated with reduced myelination in the gray and white matter. The novel multimodal imaging technique applied here shows promise for noninvasively assessing parameters associated with oxidative metabolism in both mouse models of neurological disease and for translation to study oxidative metabolism in the human brain. © 2022</p>"
6,2-s2.0-85126910627,Development of a Chemical Cocktail That Rescues Mouse Brain Demyelination in a Cuprizone-Induced Model,"<p>Oligodendrocytes are glial cells located in the central nervous system (CNS) that play essential roles in the transmission of nerve signals and in the neuroprotection of myelinated neurons. The dysfunction or loss of oligodendrocytes leads to demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS). To treat demyelinating diseases, the development of a therapy that promotes remyelination is required. In the present study, we established an in vitro method to convert human fibroblasts into induced oligodendrocyte-like cells (iOLCs) in 3 days. The induced cells displayed morphologies and molecular signatures similar to oligodendrocytes after treatment with valproic acid and exposure to the small molecules Y27632, SU9516, and forskolin (FSK). To pursue the development of a cell-free remyelination therapy in vivo, we used a cuprizone-induced demyelinated mouse model. The small molecules (Y27632, SU9516, and FSK) were directly injected into the demyelinated corpus callosum of the mouse brain. This combination of small molecules rescued the demyelination phenotype within two weeks as observed by light and electron microscopy. These results provide a foundation for exploring the development of a treatment for demyelinating diseases via regenerative medicine. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.</p>"
7,2-s2.0-85124043337,Locomotor and histological changes in a cuprizone-induced animal model of multiple sclerosis: Comparison between alpha-tocopherol and fingolimod,"<p>Background and purpose: Fingolimod is a sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor modulator used to treat multiple sclerosis (MS). Alpha-tocopherol (AT) has been found to improve motor function in an animal model of MS. In the present study, the effects of AT and fingolimod on the locomotor function and histological evidence of demyelination were compared in a cuprizone-induced rat model of MS. Experimental approach: Female Sprague-Dawley rats (8 weeks) were fed with 0.2% (w/w) cuprizone diet for 5 weeks followed by intraperitoneal injections of fingolimod (3 mg/Kg; group F, n = 10) and alpha- tocopherol (100 mg/Kg; group A, n = 10). Vehicle-treated rats (group V, n = 10) were treated intraperitoneally with 1% ethanol in saline on weeks 6 and 7. Open field and beam walking tests were carried out every 10 days. The mean area of demyelination in the corpus callosum was quantified using Luxol fast blue stained histological sections of the forebrain. Findings/Results: The mean speed of movement was increased by 54% and 50% in groups F and A compared to group V. Total distance moved was increased by 61% and 52.7% in groups F and A compared to group V. Mean time to walk the beam was reduced in group A by 52% compared to group V. Mean frequency of crossing lines from the inner squares to outer squares was reduced in groups A and F compared to group V. Mean area of demyelination in corpus callosum showed 62% reduction in group A compared to group V. Conclusion and implications: Both fingolimod and AT treatments improved the locomotor function. However, AT treatment reduced the areas of demyelination in higher proportion and improved motor coordination and exploratory behavior. © 2022 Wolters Kluwer Medknow Publications.

8,2-s2.0-85118626969,Adult-onset vanishing white matter in a patient with EIF2B3 variants misdiagnosed as multiple sclerosis,"<p>Background: Vanishing white matter (VWM) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by childhood ataxia with central hypomyelination. Adult-onset VWM should be considered as a differential diagnosis for suspected cases of multiple sclerosis (MS). Methods: Targeted region sequencing (TRS) and Sanger sequencing validation were performed to identify and validate the likely pathogenic mutations in a family with VWM. Results: The main clinical manifestations of the proband included decreased vision and sleepiness accompanied by atrophy of the corpus callosum, affected inner rim of the corpus callosum, decreased apparent diffusion coefficient value or persistent hyperintensity-diffusion-weighted imaging, atrophied optic nerve, and no recordable visual evoked potentials. Due to the slow development and atypical VWM image features, MS was initially suspected. After prednisone was administered, the patient’s condition did not improve significantly, and other diseases were considered. The TRS and Sanger sequencing identified compound heterozygous mutations of EIF2B3 in the proband; c.965C &gt; G /p.Ala322Gly in exon 8 and c.130G &gt; A/p.Glu44Lys in exon 2 were missense mutations inherited from the mother and father, respectively. The proband’s oldest brother had the same compound heterozygous mutations but showed no symptoms. Conclusion: This is the first report of adult-onset VWM in a Chinese family. Initially, MS was suspected, and genetic testing confirmed the diagnosis of VWM. This study may further broaden the clinical spectrum of EIF2B3, thus providing a foundation for further research on the pathogenesis and genetic therapy for VWM. © 2021, Fondazione Società Italiana di Neurologia.</p>"
9,2-s2.0-85112643233,An in vivo implementation of the MEX MRI for myelin fraction of mice brain,"<p>Objective: Magnetization EXchange (MEX) sequence measures a signal linearly dependent on the myelin proton fraction by selective suppression of water magnetization and a recovery period. Varying the recovery period enables extraction of the percentile fraction of myelin bound protons. We aim to demonstrate the MEX sequence sensitivity to the fraction of protons associated with myelin in mice brain, in vivo. Methods: The cuprizone mouse model was used to manipulate the myelin content. Mice fed cuprizone (n = 15) and normal chow (n = 8) were imaged in vivo using MEX sequence. MR images were segmented into corpus callosum and internal capsule (white matter) and cortical gray matter, and fitted to the recovery equation. Results were analyzed with correlation to MWF and histopathology. Results: The extracted parameters show significant differences in the corpus callosum between the cuprizone and control groups. The cuprizone group exhibited reduced myelin fraction 26.5% (P &lt; 0.01). The gray matter values were less affected, with 13.5% reduction (P &lt; 0.05); no changes were detected in the internal capsule. Results were validated by MWF scans and good correlation to the histology analysis (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.685). Conclusion: The results of this first in vivo implementation of the MEX sequence provide a quantitative measure of demyelination in brain white matter. © 2021, European Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine and Biology (ESMRMB).</p>"
10,2-s2.0-85112577145,Functional and structural MRI correlates of executive functions in multiple sclerosis,"<p>Background: Executive dysfunctions, including difficulties in attention, working memory, planning, and inhibition affect 15%–28% of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. Objectives: To investigate structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) abnormalities underlying executive function (EF) in MS patients. Methods: A total 116 MS patients and 65 controls underwent resting-state (RS) and diffusion-weighted sequences and neuropsychological examination, including Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST) to test EF. Brain RS cognitive networks and fractional anisotropy (FA) from a priori selected white matter tracts were derived. Associations of WCST scores with RS functional connectivity (FC) and FA abnormalities were investigated. Results: In MS patients, predictors of working memory/updating were: lower corpus callosum (CC) FA, lower left working-memory network (WMN), right WMN RS FC for worse performance; lower executive control network (ECN), higher default-mode network (DMN), and salience network (SN) RS FC for better performance (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.35). Predictors of attention were lower CC genu FA, lower left WMN, and DMN RS FC for worse performance; higher left WMN and ECN RS FC for better performance (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.24). Predictors of worse shifting/inhibition were lower CC genu and superior cerebellar peduncle (SCP) FA, lower left WMN RS FC for worse performance; and higher ECN RS FC for better performance (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.24). Conclusions: CC and SCP microstructural damage and RS FC abnormalities in cognitive networks underlie EF frailty in MS. © The Author(s), 2021.</p>"
11,2-s2.0-85112329645,White matter microstructural differences in children and genetic risk for multiple sclerosis: A population-based study,"<p>Background: MS patients show abnormalities in white matter (WM) on brain imaging, with heterogeneity in the location of WM lesions. The “pothole” method can be applied to diffusion-weighted images to identify spatially distinct clusters of divergent brain WM microstructure. Objective: To investigate the association between genetic risk for MS and spatially independent clusters of decreased or increased fractional anisotropy (FA) in the brain. In addition, we studied sex- and age-related differences. Methods: 3 Tesla diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data were collected in 8- to 12-year-old children from a population-based study. Global and tract-based potholes (lower FA clusters) and molehills (higher FA clusters) were quantified in 3047 participants with usable DTI data. A polygenic risk score (PRS) for MS was calculated in genotyped individuals (n = 1087) and linear regression analyses assessed the relationship between the PRS and the number of potholes and molehills, correcting for multiple testing using the False Discovery Rate. Results: The number of molehills increased with age, potholes decreased with age, and fewer potholes were observed in girls during typical development. The MS-PRS was positively associated with the number of molehills (β = 0.9, SE = 0.29, p = 0.002). Molehills were found more often in the corpus callosum (β = 0.3, SE = 0.09, p = 0.0003). Conclusion: Genetic risk for MS is associated with spatially distinct clusters of increased FA during childhood brain development. © The Author(s), 2021.</p>"
12,2-s2.0-85112321703,"Volume changes of thalamus, hippocampus and cerebellum are associated with specific CSF profile in MS","<p>Background: The underlying pathogenesis of surface-in grey matter abnormalities in MS, demonstrated by both neuropathology and advanced MRI analyses, is under investigation and it might be related to CSF-mediated mechanism of inflammation and/or damage. Objective: To examine the link of CSF inflammatory profile with the damage of three regions early-involved in MS and bordering with CSF: thalamus, hippocampus and cerebellum. Methods: In this longitudinal, prospective study, we evaluated, in 109 relapsing–remitting MS patients, at diagnosis and after 2-year follow-up, the association between the baseline CSF level of 19 inflammatory mediators and the volume changes of thalamus, hippocampus, cerebellar cortex and control regions (globus pallidus, putamen). Results: The multivariable analysis showed that the CXCL13 and sCD163 CSF levels at baseline were independent predictors of thalamus ((Formula presented.) ; p &lt; 0.001) and hippocampus ((Formula presented.) ; p &lt; 0.001) volume change after 2-year follow-up. These molecules, plus CCL25, IFN-γ and fibrinogen, were independent predictors of the cerebellar cortex volume loss ((Formula presented.) ; p &lt; 0.001). No independent predictors of volume changes of the control regions were found. Conclusion: Our results indicate an association between the CSF inflammatory profile and grey matter volume loss of regions anatomically close to CSF boundaries, thus supporting the hypothesis of a surface-in GM damage in MS. © The Author(s), 2021.</p>"
13,2-s2.0-85127886516,Rapid parameter estimation for selective inversion recovery myelin imaging using an open-source Julia toolkit,"<p>Background: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is used extensively to quantify myelin content, however computational bottlenecks remain challenging for advanced imaging techniques in clinical settings. We present a fast, open-source toolkit for processing quantitative magnetization transfer derived from selective inversion recovery (SIR) acquisitions that allows parameter map estimation, including the myelin-sensitive macromolecular pool size ratio (PSR). Significant progress has been made in reducing SIR acquisition times to improve clinically feasibility. However, parameter map estimation from the resulting data remains computationally expensive. To overcome this computational limitation, we developed a computationally efficient, open-source toolkit implemented in the Julia language. Methods: To test the accuracy of this toolkit, we simulated SIR images with varying PSR and spin-lattice relaxation time of the free water pool (R<sub>1f</sub>) over a physiologically meaningful scale from 5% to 20% and 0.5 to 1.5 s<sup>−1</sup>, respectively. Rician noise was then added, and the parameter maps were estimated using our Julia toolkit. Probability density histogram plots and Lin’s concordance correlation coefficients (LCCC) were used to assess accuracy and precision of the fits to our known simulation data. To further mimic biological tissue, we generated five cross-linked bovine serum albumin (BSA) phantoms with concentrations that ranged from 1.25% to 20%. The phantoms were imaged at 3T using SIR, and data were fit to estimate PSR and R<sub>1f</sub>. Similarly, a healthy volunteer was imaged at 3T, and SIR parameter maps were estimated to demonstrate the reduced computational time for a real-world clinical example. Results: Estimated SIR parameter maps from our Julia toolkit agreed with simulated values (LCCC &gt; 0.98). This toolkit was further validated using BSA phantoms and a whole brain scan at 3T. In both cases, SIR parameter estimates were consistent with published values using MATLAB. However, compared to earlier work using MATLAB, our Julia toolkit provided an approximate 20-fold reduction in computational time. Conclusions: Presented here, we developed a fast, open-source, toolkit for rapid and accurate SIR MRI using Julia. The reduction in computational cost should allow SIR parameters to be accessible in clinical settings. Copyright 2022 Sisco et al.</p>"

15,2-s2.0-85127942631,Clemastine Induces an Impairment in Developmental Myelination,"<p>Abnormalities in myelination are associated to behavioral and cognitive dysfunction in neurodevelopmental psychiatric disorders. Thus, therapies to promote or accelerate myelination could potentially ameliorate symptoms in autism. Clemastine, a histamine H1 antagonist with anticholinergic properties against muscarinic M1 receptor, is the most promising drug with promyelinating properties. Clemastine penetrates the blood brain barrier efficiently and promotes remyelination in different animal models of neurodegeneration including multiple sclerosis, ischemia and Alzheimer’s disease. However, its role in myelination during development is unknown. We showed that clemastine treatment during development increased oligodendrocyte differentiation in both white and gray matter. However, despite the increase in the number of oligodendrocytes, conduction velocity of myelinated fibers of corpus callosum decreased in clemastine treated mice. Confocal and electron microscopy showed a reduction in the number of myelinated axons and nodes of Ranvier and a reduction of myelin thickness in corpus callosum. To understand the mechanisms leading to myelin formation impairment in the presence of an excess of myelinating oligodendrocytes, we focused on microglial cells that also express muscarinic M1 receptors. Importantly, the population of CD11c<sup>+</sup> microglia cells, necessary for myelination, as well as the levels of insulin growth factor-1 decrease in clemastine-treated mice. Altogether, these data suggest that clemastine impact on myelin development is more complex than previously thought and could be dependent on microglia-oligodendrocyte crosstalk. Further studies are needed to clarify the role of microglia cells on developmental myelination.

16,2-s2.0-85126785569,Diffusion Tensor Imaging Revealed Microstructural Changes in Normal-Appearing White Matter Regions in Relapsing–Remitting Multiple Sclerosis,"<p>Background: Axons and myelin sheaths are the physical foundation for white matter (WM) to perform normal functions. Our previous study found the metabolite abnormalities in frontal, parietal, and occipital normal-appearing white matter (NAWM) regions in relapsing–remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) patients by applying a 2D <sup>1</sup>H magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging method. Since the metabolite changes may associate with the microstructure changes, we used the diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) method to assess the integrity of NAWM in this study. Method: Diffusion tensor imaging scan was performed on 17 clinically definite RRMS patients and 21 age-matched healthy controls on a 3.0-T scanner. DTI metrics including fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (AD), and radial diffusivity (RD) were extracted from 19 predefined regions of interest (ROIs), which were generated by removing a mask of manually drawn probabilistic lesion map from the Johns Hopkins University white-matter atlas. The mean values of FA, MD, AD, and RD were compared between different groups in the same ROIs. Results: A probabilistic lesion map was successfully generated, and the lesion regions were eliminated from the WM atlas. We found that the RRMS patients had significantly lower FA in the entire corpus callosum (CC), bilateral of anterior corona radiata, and right posterior thalamic radiation (PTR). At the same time, RRMS patients showed significantly higher MD in the bilateral anterior corona radiata and superior corona radiata. Moreover, all AD values increased, and the bilateral external capsule, PTR, and left tapetum NAWM show statistical significance. What is more, all NAWM tracts showed increasing RD values in RRMS patients, and the bilateral superior corona radiata, the anterior corona radiata, right PTR, and the genu CC reach statistical significance. Conclusion: Our study revealed widespread microstructure changes in NAWM in RRMS patients through a ready-made WM atlas and probabilistic lesion map. These findings support the hypothesis of demyelination, accumulation of inflammatory cells, and axonal injury in NAWM for RRMS. The DTI-based metrics could be considered as potential non-invasive biomarkers of disease severity. Copyright © 2022 Bao, Tu, Li, Sun, Hu, Zhang and Li.</p>"
17,2-s2.0-85127520222,An Equivocal SCC Lesion—Antiepileptic-Induced CLOCC,"<p>We present a case of a woman who reported to the emergency unit due to recurrent episodes of severe headache and collapse. MRI examination revealed no relevant findings apart from small meningioma of the right parietal region. The patient was diagnosed with epilepsy and received outpatient treatment, which was changed due to poor toleration. A follow-up MRI was performed which revealed an isolated, focal lesion of the splenium of the corpus callosum. The patient underwent extensive laboratory testing and antiseizure medications were started again. Another MRI indicated substantial regression of the splenium of the corpus callosum (SCC) lesion. Both the complete clinical image and results of the diagnostic evaluation spoke in favor of cytotoxicity of the corpus callosum associated with anti-epileptic drug treatment. Pathologies involving the corpus callosum include congenital, demyelination, infection, neoplasm, trauma and vascular changes. Isolated, non-specific lesions of the splenium of corpus callosum usually indicate multiple sclerosis; however, other pathologies should be considered. Anti-epileptic drugs may evoke cytotoxic lesions of the corpus callosum (CLOCCs). © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.</p>"

19,2-s2.0-85123220024,"Two-dimensional measurements with cut-off values are useful for assessing brain volume, physical disability, and processing speed in multiple sclerosis","<p>Background: Two-dimensional (2D) measures have been proposed as potential proxy measures for whole-brain volume in multiple sclerosis (MS); however, cut-off values that determine the degree of brain volume loss (BVL) have not been established. Since we had previously developed a system to categorize MS patients into clusters with significantly different degrees of BVL, we tried to identify cut-off values for 2D measurements that can discriminate MS patients on the basis of disease severity associated with brain atrophy. Methods: In this cross-sectional analysis, ninety-one consecutive Japanese MS patients—clinically isolated syndrome (5%), relapsing-remitting MS (78%) and progressive MS (17%)—were categorized into two clusters (CL1 and CL2) with a significantly different degree of BVL using the method described in our previous study. MS patients were also evaluated for 2D measurements, namely, third ventricle width, lateral ventricle width (LVW), bicaudate ratio (BCR), and corpus callosum index (CCI). Thereafter, we performed receiver operating characteristic analysis to determine the cut-off values of the 2D measurements for categorizing the MS patients into two clusters. Results: We identified optimal cut-off values for each 2D measure with high specificity and sensitivity. The cut-off values for LVW, BCR, and CCI divided the MS patients into two subgroups, in which whole-brain and grey matter volume, EDSS, and processing speed were significantly different. Conclusion: LVW, BCR, and CCI with particular cut-off values are useful to discriminate MS patients with decreased brain volume, physical disability, and processing speed. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.</p>"
20,2-s2.0-85119426178,Multiple sclerosis impairment scale and brain MRI in secondary progressive multiple sclerosis,"<p>Objective: To examine the Multiple Sclerosis Impairment Scale (MSIS) in secondary progressive MS (SPMS) in relation to the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) outcomes, and mobility. Methods: In this observational single-center study, 68 secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS) patients were examined by MSIS, EDSS, functional mobility tests of upper/lower extremities, and multimodal MRI. Participants had EDSS ≥3.5, a decline in daily activities over the last year unrelated to relapses, and/or 6-month confirmed disability progression. Results: Mean disease duration was 23.1 ± 8.3 years and mean age 54.4 ± 8.1 years. MSIS, EDSS, and their corresponding motor, cerebellar, and sensory subscores correlated (p &lt;.0001). Motor subscores of MSIS correlated stronger with Timed-25-Foot-Walk (T25FW) than pyramidal functional system score (FSS) (p =.03), but EDSS had a stronger correlation to T25FW than the total MSIS score (p =.01). MSIS cerebellar subscore correlated stronger with 9-Hole Peg Test (9-HPT) than cerebellar FSS (p =.04). The sensory MSIS subscore also showed correlation with 9-HPT in contrast to sensory FSS (p =.006). MSIS subscores had stronger correlations with MRI volumetry measures than FSS scores (lesion volume and putamen, thalamus, corpus callosum volumetry, p =.0001–0.0017). Conclusion: In patients with SPMS, MSIS correlated with functional motor tests. MSIS showed stronger correlations with atrophy of central nervous system areas, and may be more sensitive to scale cerebellar and sensory function than EDSS. © 2021 John Wiley &amp; Sons A/S.

21,2-s2.0-85112446984,The clinical and paraclinical correlates of employment status in multiple sclerosis,"<p>Purpose: To identify the clinical and paraclinical markers of employment status in multiple sclerosis (MS). Methods: This was a cross-sectional sub-study investigating 1226 MS patients. To minimalized confounding effect, two groups of patients, matched by sex, age, and education, were selected: 307 patients with full time employment and 153 unemployed patients receiving disability pension. We explored associations between employment status and Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), 25 Foot Walk Test (25FWT), Nine Hole Peg Test (9HPT), Brief International Cognitive Assessment for MS (BICAMS), Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), SLOAN charts (SLOAN), and brain volumetric MRI measures. Results: Both groups differed significantly on all variables of interest (p &lt; 0.001). In the univariate analyses, EDSS, SDMT (Symbol Digit Modalities Test) adjusted for BDI, 25FWT, and 9HPT best explained variability in vocational status. In multivariate analyses, the combination of EDSS, 25FWT, SDMT, BDI, and corpus callosum fraction (CCF) explained the greatest variability. As a next step, after patients were matched by EDSS, differences in SDMT, 25FWT (both p &lt; 0.001), 9HPT, CCF, and T2 lesion volume were still present (all p &lt; 0.005) between both groups. The best multivariate model consisted of SDMT, BDI, and T2 lesion volume. Conclusions: EDSS, walking ability, cognitive performance, and MRI volumetric parameters are independently associated with employment status. © 2021, Fondazione Società Italiana di Neurologia.</p>"
22,2-s2.0-85112332412,Oligodendrocyte pathology in fetal alcohol spectrum disorders,"<p>The pathology of fetal alcohol syndrome and the less severe fetal alcohol spectrum disorders includes brain dysmyelination. Recent studies have shed light on the molecular mechanisms underlying these white matter abnormalities. Rodent models of fetal alcohol syndrome and human studies have shown suppressed oligodendrocyte differentiation and apoptosis of oligodendrocyte precursor cells. Ethanol exposure led to reduced expression of myelin basic protein and delayed myelin basic protein expression in rat and mouse models of fetal alcohol syndrome and in human histopathological specimens. Several studies have reported increased expression of many chemokines in dysmyelinating disorders in central nervous system, including multiple sclerosis and fetal alcohol syndrome. Acute ethanol exposure reduced levels of the neuroprotective insulin-like growth factor-1 in fetal and maternal sheep and in human fetal brain tissues, while ethanol increased the expression of tumor necrosis factor α in mouse and human neurons. White matter lesions have been induced in the developing sheep brain by alcohol exposure in early gestation. Rat fetal alcohol syndrome models have shown reduced axon diameters, with thinner myelin sheaths, as well as reduced numbers of oligodendrocytes, which were also morphologically aberrant oligodendrocytes. Expressions of markers for mature myelination, including myelin basic protein, also were reduced. The accumulating knowledge concerning the mechanisms of ethanol-induced dysmyelination could lead to the development of strategies to prevent dysmyelination in children exposed to ethanol during fetal development. Future studies using fetal oligodendrocyte- and oligodendrocyte precursor cell-derived exosomes isolated from the mother's blood may identify biomarkers for fetal alcohol syndrome and even implicate epigenetic changes in early development that affect oligodendrocyte precursor cell and oligodendrocyte function in adulthood. By combining various imaging modalities with molecular studies, it may be possible to determine which fetuses are at risk and to intervene therapeutically early in the pregnancy. © 2022 Wolters Kluwer Medknow Publications.

Quantitative measurement of T<sub>1</sub> and T<sub>2</sub> relaxation, and diffusion basis spectrum imaging (DBSI) yield metrics related to the pathology of neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration that occurs across the spectrum of MS. Objective: To use relaxation and DBSI MRI metrics to describe measures of neuroinflammation, myelin and axons in different MS subtypes. Methods: 103 participants (20 clinically isolated syndrome (CIS), 33 relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS), 30 secondary progressive MS and 20 primary progressive MS) underwent quantitative T<sub>1</sub>, T<sub>2</sub>, DBSI and conventional 3T MRI. Whole brain, normal-appearing white matter, lesion and corpus callosum MRI metrics were compared across MS subtypes. Results: A gradation of MRI metric values was seen from CIS to RRMS to progressive MS. RRMS demonstrated large oedema-related differences, while progressive MS had the most extensive abnormalities in myelin and axonal measures. Conclusion: Relaxation and DBSI-derived MRI measures show differences between MS subtypes related to the severity and composition of underlying tissue damage. RRMS showed oedema, demyelination and axonal loss compared with CIS. Progressive MS had even more evidence of increased oedema, demyelination and axonal loss compared with CIS and RRMS. © The Author(s), 2021.</p>"
25,2-s2.0-85124939482,Mitochondrial Neurodegeneration,"<p>Mitochondria are cytoplasmic organelles, which generate energy as heat and ATP, the universal energy currency of the cell. This process is carried out by coupling electron stripping through oxidation of nutrient substrates with the formation of a proton-based electrochemical gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane. Controlled dissipation of the gradient can lead to production of heat as well as ATP, via ADP phosphorylation. This process is known as oxidative phosphorylation, and is carried out by four multiheteromeric complexes (from I to IV) of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, carrying out the electron flow whose energy is stored as a proton-based electrochemical gradient. This gradient sustains a second reaction, operated by the mitochondrial ATP synthase, or complex V, which condensates ADP and Pi into ATP. Four complexes (CI, CIII, CIV, and CV) are composed of proteins encoded by genes present in two separate compartments: The nuclear genome and a small circular DNA found in mitochondria themselves, and are termed mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). Mutations striking either genome can lead to mitochondrial impairment, determining infantile, childhood or adult neurodegeneration. Mitochondrial disorders are complex neurological syndromes, and are often part of a multisystem disorder. In this paper, we divide the diseases into those caused by mtDNA defects and those that are due to mutations involving nuclear genes; from a clinical point of view, we discuss pediatric disorders in comparison to juvenile or adult-onset conditions. The complementary genetic contributions controlling organellar function and the complexity of the biochemical pathways present in the mitochondria justify the extreme genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity of this new area of inborn errors of metabolism known as ‘mitochondrial medicine’. © 2022 by the authors.</p>"
26,2-s2.0-85123230290,Ponesimod inhibits astrocyte-mediated neuroinflammation and protects against cingulum demyelination via S1P<inf>1</inf>-selective modulation,"<p>Ponesimod is a sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) receptor (S1PR) modulator that was recently approved for treating relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS). Three other FDA-approved S1PR modulators for MS—fingolimod, siponimod, and ozanimod—share peripheral immunological effects via common S1P<sub>1</sub> interactions, yet ponesimod may access distinct central nervous system (CNS) mechanisms through its selectivity for the S1P<sub>1</sub> receptor. Here, ponesimod was examined for S1PR internalization and binding, human astrocyte signaling and single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) gene expression, and in vivo using murine cuprizone-mediated demyelination. Studies confirmed ponesimod’s selectivity for S1P<sub>1</sub> without comparable engagement to the other S1PR subtypes (S1P<sub>2,3,4,5</sub>). Ponesimod showed pharmacological properties of acute agonism followed by chronic functional antagonism of S1P<sub>1</sub>. A major locus of S1P<sub>1</sub> expression in the CNS is on astrocytes, and scRNA-seq of primary human astrocytes exposed to ponesimod identified a gene ontology relationship of reduced neuroinflammation and reduction in known astrocyte disease-related genes including those of immediate early astrocytes that have been strongly associated with disease progression in MS animal models. Remarkably, ponesimod prevented cuprizone-induced demyelination selectively in the cingulum, but not in the corpus callosum. These data support the CNS activities of ponesimod through S1P<sub>1</sub>, including protective, and likely selective, effects against demyelination in a major connection pathway of the brain, the limbic fibers of the cingulum, lesions of which have been associated with several neurologic impairments including MS fatigue. © 2022 The Authors.

27,2-s2.0-85121132301,Perivascular space is associated with brain atrophy in patients with multiple sclerosis,"<p>Background: Perivascular space (PVS) is associated with neurodegenerative and neuroimmune diseases. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is traditionally a neuroimmune disease. However, studies show neurodegeneration also plays a vital role in MS. At present, most studies conclude severer PVS in MS is an imaging marker of neuroinflammation, while a 7T MRI study suggests that PVS in MS is associated with neurodegeneration. Methods: In this study, 82 MS patients (n=82) and 32 healthy controls (n=32) were enrolled. The following indexes were measured: the number, size and distribution of PVS, the PVS score, corpus callosum index (CCI), corpus callosum area (CCA), the ratio of the corpus callosum to the cranium (CCR), aligned third ventricle width (a3VW), and unaligned third ventricle width (u3VW). Results: The PVS score (4 vs. 3, P=0.041), PVSs number (103.280±45.107 vs. 87.625±30.139, P=0.035), and enlarged perivascular spaces (EPVSs) number (9 vs. 1, P&lt;0.001) of MS patients were significantly higher than in the healthy controls. PVSs number (23.5 vs. 13) and EPVSs number (1 vs. 0) in the basal ganglia (BG), and EPVSs number (3 vs. 0) in centrum semiovale (CSO) of MS patients were significantly higher than in the healthy controls, P&lt;0.001. In MS patients, PVS was correlated with age and hypertension but not to the extended disability status scale (EDSS) score and other clinical data. In MS patients, PVS score was correlated with CCA (rs=0.272; P=0.013) and the CCR (rs=0.219; P=0.048), and PVSs number was correlated with CCA (rs=0.255; P=0.021), the correlation disappeared after adjusting hypertension and age. In MS patients in remission, PVSs number was correlated with CCA (rs=0.487; P=0.019), CCR (rs=0.479; P=0.021), and PVS score was correlated with CCA (rs=0.453; P=0.03). After adjustment of hypertension and age, the total number of PVSs was correlated with CCA (rs=0.419; P=0.049). Conclusions: The PVS load in MS patients was heavier than healthy people, especially in BG and CSO. PVS was not correlated with EDSS in MS patients. The PVS of MS patients was associated with CCA and CCR, and PVSs number was independently related with CCA in MS patients in remission. © Quantitative Imaging in Medicine and Surgery.

28,2-s2.0-85121115247,C1q inhibits differentiation of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells via Wnt/β-catenin signaling activation in a cuprizone-induced mouse model of multiple sclerosis,"<p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic central nervous system demyelinating disease of autoimmune originate. Complement C1q, a complex glycoprotein, mediates a variety of immunoregulatory functions considered important in the prevention of autoimmunity. Although we found that the increased serum C1q level was highly associated with the Fazekas scores and T2 lesion volume of MS patients, the effect and mechanism of C1q on demyelination remains unclear. Cluster analysis and protein array results showed that serum Wnt receptors Frizzled-6 and LRP-6 levels in MS patients were both increased, we proposed that C1q may be involved in demyelination via Wnt signaling. The increased C1q protein levels in the serum and brain tissue were confirmed in a cuprizone (CPZ)-induced demyelination mice model. Moreover, CPZ treatment induced significant increase of LRP-6 and Frizzled-6 protein in mice corpus callosum. LRP-6 extra-cellular domain (LRP-6-ECD) level in the serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of CPZ mice also significantly increased. Knockdown of the subunit C1s of C1 not only substantially attenuated demyelination, promoted M2 microglia polarization and improved neurological function, but inhibited β-catenin expression and its nuclear translocation in oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs). In vitro, C1s silence reversed the increased level of LRP-6-ECD in the medium and β-catenin expression in OPCs induced by C1q treatment. Meanwhile, inhibition of C1s also markedly lowered the number of EDU positive OPCs, but enhanced the number of CNPase positive oligodendrocyte and the protein of MBP. The present study indicated that C1q was involved in demyelination in response to CPZ in mice by preventing OPC from differentiating into mature oligodendrocyte via Wnt/β-catenin signaling activation. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.</p>"
29,2-s2.0-85119279000,Quantification of normal-appearing white matter damage in early relapse-onset multiple sclerosis through neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging,"<p>Background Neurodegeneration is a major contributor of neurological disability in multiple sclerosis (MS). The possibility to fully characterize normal appearing white matter (NAWM) damage could provide the missing information needed to clarify the mechanisms beyond disability accumulation. Objective In the present study we aimed to characterize the presence and extent of NAWM damage and its correlation with clinical disability. Methods We applied Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) and Neurite Orientation Dispersion and Density Imaging (NODDI) in a cohort of 27 early relapse-onset MS patients (disease duration &lt; 5 years) compared to a population of 26 age- and sex-matched healthy controls (HCs). All patients underwent a neurological examination, including the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS). Results MS patients showed lower fractional anisotropy (FA) and higher mean diffusivity (MD) values in the main WM bundles, such as the corticospinal tract, corpus callosum, superior and middle cerebellar peduncles, posterior thalamic radiation (which includes optic radiation), cingulum and external capsule. All brain areas with reduced FA/increased MD also displayed a reduction in neurite density index (NDI). However, comparing individual voxels of the WM skeleton between MS and HCs, a higher number of NDI significant voxels was disclosed compared to FA/MD (56.4% vs 11.2%/41.2%). No significant correlations were observed between DTI/NODDI metrics and EDSS. Conclusions Our findings suggest that NDI may allow for a better characterization and understanding of the microstructural changes in the NAWM since the early relapsing-remitting MS phases. Future longitudinal studies including a larger cohort of patients with different clinical phenotypes may clarify the association between NODDI metrics and disability progression. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.</p>"
30,2-s2.0-85117606240,N-myc downstream regulated family member 1 (NDRG1) is enriched in myelinating oligodendrocytes and impacts myelin degradation in response to demyelination,"<p>The N-myc downstream regulated gene family member 1 (NDRG1) is a gene whose mutation results in peripheral neuropathy with central manifestations. While most of previous studies characterized NDRG1 role in Schwann cells, the detection of central nervous system symptoms and the identification of NDRG1 as a gene silenced in the white matter of multiple sclerosis brains raise the question regarding its role in oligodendrocytes. Here, we show that NDRG1 is enriched in oligodendrocytes and myelin preparations, and we characterize its expression using a novel reporter mouse (TgNdrg1-EGFP). We report NDRG1 expression during developmental myelination and during remyelination after cuprizone-induced demyelination of the adult corpus callosum. The transcriptome of Ndrg1-EGFP+ cells further supports the identification of late myelinating oligodendrocytes, characterized by expression of genes regulating lipid metabolism and bioenergetics. We also generate a lineage specific conditional knockout (Olig1<sup>cre/+</sup>;Ndrg1<sup>fl/fl</sup>) line to study its function. Null mice develop normally, and despite similar numbers of progenitor cells as wild type, they have fewer mature oligodendrocytes and lower levels of myelin proteins than controls, thereby suggesting NDRG1 as important for the maintenance of late myelinating oligodendrocytes. In addition, when control and Ndrg1 null mice are subject to cuprizone-induced demyelination, we observe a higher degree of demyelination in the mutants. Together these data identify NDRG1 as an important molecule for adult myelinating oligodendrocytes, whose decreased levels in the normal appearing white matter of human MS brains may result in greater susceptibility of myelin to damage. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.</p>"

It has been suggested that exercise and intake of probiotics might influence MS pathology and, thereby, slow down the disease process in MS patients. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the effect of exercise training with Lactobacillus plantarum intake on ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule 1, glial fibrillary acidic protein, interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-1β in cuprizone-induced demyelination mouse model of MS. Methods: Mice were exposed to cuprizone for 13 weeks. In the fifth week, motor and balance tests were carried out on them. The mice (n = 5 per group) were randomly divided into five groups: control (C), MS, MS with exercise (MS + Exe), MS with probiotics (MS + Pro) and MS with probiotics and exercise (MS + Pro + Exe). The exercise groups carried out aerobic exercises 5 days a week for 2 months. The mice received probiotic by gavage. One day after the interventions finished, the mice were killed. Biochemical and molecular biology analyses were carried out. Results: Ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule 1 and glial fibrillary acidic protein expression values in the MS + Pro + Exe, MS + Pro, and MS + Exe groups showed a significant decrease compared with the MS group (P &lt;.05). Also, glial fibrillary acidic protein gene expression in the intervention groups showed an insignificant decrease (P &gt;.05). The IL-6 and IL-1β values in the MS + Exe and MS + Pro + Exe groups showed a significant decrease compared with the MS group (P &lt;.05).

32,2-s2.0-85106728764,"Contrasting the brain imaging features of MOG-antibody disease, with AQP4-antibody NMOSD and multiple sclerosis","<p>Background: Identifying magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) markers in myelin-oligodendrocytes-glycoprotein antibody-associated disease (MOGAD), neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder-aquaporin-4 positive (NMOSD-AQP4) and multiple sclerosis (MS) is essential for establishing objective outcome measures. Objectives: To quantify imaging patterns of central nervous system (CNS) damage in MOGAD during the remission stage, and to compare it with NMOSD-AQP4 and MS. Methods: 20 MOGAD, 19 NMOSD-AQP4, 18 MS in remission with brain or spinal cord involvement and 18 healthy controls (HC) were recruited. Volumetrics, lesions and cortical lesions, diffusion-imaging measures, were analysed. Results: Deep grey matter volumes were lower in MOGAD (p = 0.02) and MS (p = 0.0001), compared to HC and were strongly correlated with current lesion volume (MOGAD R = −0.93, p &lt; 0.001, MS R = −0.65, p = 0.0034). Cortical/juxtacortical lesions were seen in a minority of MOGAD, in a majority of MS and in none of NMOSD-AQP4. Non-lesional tissue fractional anisotropy (FA) was only reduced in MS (p = 0.01), although focal reductions were noted in NMOSD-AQP4, reflecting mainly optic nerve and corticospinal tract pathways. Conclusion: MOGAD patients are left with grey matter damage, and this may be related to persistent white matter lesions. NMOSD-AQP4 patients showed a relative sparing of deep grey matter volumes, but reduced non-lesional tissue FA. Observations from our study can be used to identify new markers of damage for future multicentre studies. © The Author(s), 2021.</p>"
33,2-s2.0-85123376356,Smoothened/AMP-Activated Protein Kinase Signaling in Oligodendroglial Cell Maturation,"<p>The regeneration of myelin is known to restore axonal conduction velocity after a demyelinating event. Remyelination failure in the central nervous system contributes to the severity and progression of demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis. Remyelination is controlled by many signaling pathways, such as the Sonic hedgehog (Shh) pathway, as shown by the canonical activation of its key effector Smoothened (Smo), which increases the proliferation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells via the upregulation of the transcription factor Gli1. On the other hand, the inhibition of Gli1 was also found to promote the recruitment of a subset of adult neural stem cells and their subsequent differentiation into oligodendrocytes. Since Smo is also able to transduce Shh signals via various non-canonical pathways such as the blockade of Gli1, we addressed the potential of non-canonical Smo signaling to contribute to oligodendroglial cell maturation in myelinating cells using the non-canonical Smo agonist GSA-10, which downregulates Gli1. Using the Oli-neuM cell line, we show that GSA-10 promotes Gli2 upregulation, MBP and MAL/OPALIN expression via Smo/AMP-activated Protein Kinase (AMPK) signaling, and efficiently increases the number of axonal contact/ensheathment for each oligodendroglial cell. Moreover, GSA-10 promotes the recruitment and differentiation of oligodendroglial progenitors into the demyelinated corpus callosum in vivo. Altogether, our data indicate that non-canonical signaling involving Smo/AMPK modulation and Gli1 downregulation promotes oligodendroglia maturation until axon engagement. Thus, GSA-10, by activation of this signaling pathway, represents a novel potential remyelinating agent.

34,2-s2.0-85128018921,Mouse models of immune dysfunction: their neuroanatomical differences reflect their anxiety-behavioural phenotype,"<p>Extensive evidence supports the role of the immune system in modulating brain function and behaviour. However, past studies have revealed striking heterogeneity in behavioural phenotypes produced from immune system dysfunction. Using magnetic resonance imaging, we studied the neuroanatomical differences among 11 distinct genetically modified mouse lines (n = 371), each deficient in a different element of the immune system. We found a significant and heterogeneous effect of immune dysfunction on the brains of both male and female mice. However, by imaging the whole brain and using Bayesian hierarchical modelling, we were able to identify patterns within the heterogeneous phenotype. Certain structures—such as the corpus callosum, midbrain, and thalamus—were more likely to be affected by immune dysfunction. A notable brain–behaviour relationship was identified with neuroanatomy endophenotypes across mouse models clustering according to anxiety-like behaviour phenotypes reported in literature, such as altered volume in brains regions associated with promoting fear response (e.g., the lateral septum and cerebellum). Interestingly, genes with preferential spatial expression in the most commonly affected regions are also associated with multiple sclerosis and other immune-mediated diseases. In total, our data suggest that the immune system modulates anxiety behaviour through well-established brain networks. © 2022, The Author(s).</p>"
35,2-s2.0-85127772888,Advanced diffusion-weighted imaging models better characterize white matter neurodegeneration and clinical outcomes in multiple sclerosis,"<p>Background: White matter (WM) atrophy is relevant in multiple sclerosis (MS), but the methods of analysis currently used are not specific for microstructural changes. The aims of this study were to assess the use of advanced diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) techniques proposed as measures of baseline and longitudinal WM atrophy in MS and to analyze whether these measures helped explain MS clinical disability (including cognitive impairment) better than volumetric and diffusion tensor (DT)-derived measures. Methods: 3DT1-weighted and DWI sequences were applied to 86 MS and 55 healthy controls (HC) at baseline and after one-year. Intra-cellular volume (v<sub>ic</sub>) maps were computed from neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging model. Voxel-wise fiber-bundle cross-section (FCS) atrophy in MS compared to HC was estimated. Maps of fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity were also obtained from DWI for a comparison with the proposed advanced DW-derived measures (v<sub>ic</sub> and FCS). Results: Both at baseline and after 1-year, only FCS measure showed a significant atrophy in relapsing–remitting (RR) MS compared to HC and in progressive MS compared to RRMS, mainly located in specific WM tracts (corticospinal tract, splenium of the corpus callosum, left optic radiation, bilateral cingulum, middle cerebellar peduncle and anterior commissure, p value &lt; 0.05). Global baseline FCS and v<sub>ic</sub> were the selected predictors of clinical (R-sq = 0.33, p = 0.007) and cognitive scores (R-sq = 0.29, p = 0.0014) in a linear regression model. Conclusion: Voxel-based FCS was able to detect WM tracts atrophy in MS clinical phenotypes with greater anatomical specificity compared to other measures (volumetric and DT-derived measures of WM damage). FCS and v<sub>ic</sub> measured at baseline in the WM were the best predictors of clinical disability and cognitive impairment. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.</p>"
36,2-s2.0-85127672245,Brain atrophy patterns in multiple sclerosis patients treated with natalizumab and its clinical correlates,"<p>Background: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is defined as a demyelinating disorder of the central nervous system, witnessing over the past years a remarkable progress in the therapeutic approaches of the inflammatory process. Yet, the ongoing neurodegenerative process is still ambiguous, under-assessed, and probably under-treated. Atrophy and cognitive dysfunction represent the radiological and clinical correlates of such process. In this study, we evaluated the effect of one specific MS treatment, which is natalizumab (NTZ), on brain atrophy evolution in different anatomical regions and its correlation with the cognitive profile and the physical disability. Methods: We recruited 20 patients diagnosed with relapsing-remitting MS (RR-MS) and treated with NTZ. We tracked brain atrophy in different anatomical structures using MRI scans processed with an automated image segmentation technique. We also assessed the progression of physical disability and the cognitive function and its link with the progression of atrophy. Results: During the first 2 years of treatment, a significant volume loss was noted within the corpus callosum and the cerebellum gray matter (GM). The annual atrophy rate of the cortical GM, the cerebellum GM, the thalamus, the amygdala, the globus pallidus, and the hippocampus correlated with greater memory impairment. As for the third and fourth years of treatment, a significant atrophy revolved around the gray matter, mainly the cortical one. We also noted an increase of the thalamus volume. Conclusion: Atrophy in RR-MS patients treated with NTZ is regional and targeting highly cognitive regions mainly of the subcortical gray matter and the cerebellum. The cerebellum atrophy was a marker of physical disability progression. NTZ did not accelerate the atrophy process in MS and may play a neuroprotective role by increasing the thalamus volume. © 2022 The Authors. Brain and Behavior published by Wiley Periodicals LLC.</p>"
37,2-s2.0-85127612185,Astroglial and oligodendroglial markers in the cuprizone animal model for de- and remyelination,"<p>Myelin loss with consecutive axon degeneration and impaired remyelination are the underlying causes of progressive disease in patients with multiple sclerosis. Astrocytes are suggested to play a major role in these processes. The unmasking of distinct astrocyte identities in health and disease would help to understand the pathophysiological mechanisms in which astrocytes are involved. However, the number of specific astrocyte markers is limited. Therefore, we performed immunohistochemical studies and analyzed various markers including GFAP, vimentin, S100B, ALDH1L1, and LCN2 during de- and remyelination using the toxic murine cuprizone animal model. Applying this animal model, we were able to confirm overlapping expression of vimentin and GFAP and highlighted the potential of ALDH1L1 as a pan-astrocytic marker, in agreement with previous data. Only a small population of GFAP-positive astrocytes in the corpus callosum highly up-regulated LCN2 at the peak of demyelination and S100B expression was found in a subset of oligodendroglia as well, thus S100B turned out to have a limited use as a particular astroglial marker. Additionally, numerous GFAP-positive astrocytes in the lateral corpus callosum did not express S100B, further strengthening findings of heterogeneity in the astrocytic population. In conclusion, our results acknowledged that GFAP, vimentin, LCN2, and ALDH1L1 serve as reliable marker to identify activated astrocytes during cuprizone-induced de- and remyelination. Moreover, there were clear regional and temporal differences in protein and mRNA expression levels and patterns of the studied markers, generally between gray and white matter structures. © 2022, The Author(s).</p>"
38,2-s2.0-85127444613,Phenytoin promotes the proliferation of oligodendrocytes and enhances the expression of myelin basic protein in the corpus callosum of mice demyelinated by cuprizone,"<p>Oligodendrocyte loss and myelin sheet destruction are crucial characteristics of demyelinating diseases. Phenytoin promotes the proliferation of endogenous neural precursor cells in the ventricular–subventricular zone in the postnatal brain that help restore the oligodendroglial population. This study aimed to evaluate whether phenytoin promotes myelin recovery of the corpus callosum of demyelinated adult mice. CD1 male mice were exposed to a demyelinating agent (0.2% cuprizone) for 8 weeks. We assembled two groups: the phenytoin-treated group and the control-vehicle group. The treated group received oral phenytoin (10 mg/kg) for 4 weeks. We quantified the number of Olig2 + and NG2 + oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs), Rip + oligodendrocytes, the expression level of myelin basic protein (MBP), and the muscle strength and motor coordination. The oligodendroglial lineage (Olig2 + cells, NG2 + cells, and RIP + cells) significantly increases by the phenytoin administration when compared to the control-vehicle group. The phenytoin-treated group also showed an increased expression of MBP in the corpus callosum and better functional scores in the horizontal bar test. These findings suggest that phenytoin stimulates the proliferation of OPCs, re-establishes the oligodendroglial population, promotes myelin recovery in the corpus callosum, and improves motor coordination and muscle strength. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.</p>"
39,2-s2.0-85126901294,Neuroprotective Effects and Amelioration of Ethyl Esters form of Fish Oil Supplementation in Neuroinflammation in a Mouse Model of Cuprizone-Induced Demyelination,"<p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a disease that has inflammatory effects on the brain and spinal cord. Myelin sheath degradation is the prominent outcome of MS. This study is aimed to investigate protective effects of dietary fish oil in the form of ethyl esters (EE-FO) on demyelination in mice induced by cuprizone (CPZ). We found that EE-FO supplementation ameliorated CPZ-induced demyelination and improved learning and memory impairments of mice. It was observed that demyelination was alleviated in EE-FO-treated mice which was measured through luxol fast blue (LFB) staining and expression analyses of myelin basic protein (MBP). Additionally, it was also observed that activation of microglia in the corpus callosum was reduced in EE-FO treated mice. Furthermore, we demonstrated that EE-FO treatment down-regulated the expression of M1-markers, pro-inflammatory cytokine concentration i.e., TNF-α and IL-1β, and promoted M2-markers expression (CD206 and Arginase-1). Concomitantly, the EE-FO treatment showed an increased expression of SIRT1 and AKT but suppressed the expression of NF-κB p65 and NLRP3 inflammasomes in CPZ mice. Taken together, these results suggest that EE-FO supplementation exerts neuroprotective effects on demyelination in mice induced by CPZ by modulating the SIRT1/p-AKT and SIRT1/NF-κB/NLRP3 pathways. © 2022 University of Agriculture.

Case Report: We report a case of new-onset tumefactive demyelinating brain lesion that developed after administration of an adenovector-based COVID-19 vaccine. A middle-aged female presented with recent right hemiparesis, which was noticed 2 days after she received the first dose of the vaccine. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a large subcortical T2/FLAIR hyperintensities involving corpus callosum as well. The patient responded to oral methylprednisolone. At 4 weeks, a follow-up MRI revealed a reduction in size of the lesion. Conclusion: To conclude, adenovector-based COVID-19 vaccination may be associated with a tumefactive demyelinating lesion. © 2022 Neurology India, Neurological Society of India.</p>"
41,2-s2.0-85126210707,"Ermin deficiency leads to compromised myelin, inflammatory milieu, and susceptibility to demyelinating insult","<p>Ermin is an actin-binding protein found almost exclusively in the central nervous system (CNS) as a component of myelin sheaths. Although Ermin has been predicted to play a role in the formation and stability of myelin sheaths, this has not been directly examined in vivo. Here, we show that Ermin is essential for myelin sheath integrity and normal saltatory conduction. Loss of Ermin in mice caused de-compacted and fragmented myelin sheaths and led to slower conduction along with progressive neurological deficits. RNA sequencing of the corpus callosum, the largest white matter structure in the CNS, pointed to inflammatory activation in aged Ermin-deficient mice, which was corroborated by increased levels of microgliosis and astrogliosis. The inflammatory milieu and myelin abnormalities were further associated with increased susceptibility to immune-mediated demyelination insult in Ermin knockout mice. Supporting a possible role of Ermin deficiency in inflammatory white matter disorders, a rare inactivating mutation in the ERMN gene was identified in multiple sclerosis patients. Our findings demonstrate a critical role for Ermin in maintaining myelin integrity. Given its near-exclusive expression in myelinating oligodendrocytes, Ermin deficiency represents a compelling “inside-out” model of inflammatory dysmyelination and may offer a new paradigm for the development of myelin stability-targeted therapies. © 2022 The Authors.

42,2-s2.0-85125780810,Quantitative MRI findings indicate diffuse white matter damage in Susac Syndrome,"<p>Background: Susac Syndrome (SuS) is an autoimmune endotheliopathy impacting the brain, retina and cochlea that can clinically mimic multiple sclerosis (MS). Objective: To evaluate non-lesional white matter demyelination changes in SuS compared to MS and healthy controls (HC) using quantitative MRI. Methods: 3T MRI including myelin water imaging and diffusion basis spectrum imaging were acquired for 7 SuS, 10 MS and 10 HC participants. Non-lesional white matter was analyzed in the corpus callosum (CC) and normal appearing white matter (NAWM). Groups were compared using ANCOVA with Tukey correction. Results: SuS CC myelin water fraction (mean 0.092) was lower than MS(0.11, p = 0.01) and HC(0.11, p = 0.04). Another myelin marker, radial diffusivity, was increased in SuS CC(0.27μm2/ms) compared to HC(0.21μm2/ms, p = 0.008) and MS(0.23μm2/ms, p = 0.05). Fractional anisotropy was lower in SuS CC(0.82) than HC(0.86, p = 0.04). Fiber fraction (reflecting axons) did not differ from HC or MS. In NAWM, radial diffusivity and apparent diffusion coefficient were significantly increased in SuS compared to HC(p &lt; 0.001 for both measures) and MS(p = 0.003, p &lt; 0.001 respectively). Conclusions: Our results provided evidence of myelin damage in SuS, particularly in the CC, and more extensive microstructural injury in NAWM, supporting the hypothesis that there are widespread microstructural changes in SuS syndrome including diffuse demyelination. © The Author(s), 2022.</p>"

Methods: We developed and applied a method of longitudinal deformation-based morphometry to provide voxel-level assessments of brain volume changes and identified brain regions that were significantly impacted by disease-modifying therapy. Results: Using brain MRI data from two identically designed pivotal trials of relapsing multiple sclerosis (total N = 1483), we identified multiple deep brain regions, including the thalamus and brainstem, where volume loss over time was reduced by ocrelizumab (p &lt; 0.05), a humanized anti-CD20 + monoclonal antibody approved for the treatment of multiple sclerosis. Additionally, identified brainstem shrinkage, as well as brain ventricle expansion, was associated with a greater risk for confirmed disability progression (p &lt; 0.05). Conclusions: The identification of deep brain structures has a strong implication for developing new biomarkers of brain atrophy reduction to advance drug development for multiple sclerosis, which has an increasing focus on targeting the progressive biology. © 2022 The Author(s)</p>"

We aimed to apply advanced MRI to explore what drives the often nonuniform callosal atrophy. Methods: Prospective brain 7 Tesla and 3 Tesla Human Connectom Scanner MRI were performed in 92 MS patients. White matter, leukocortical, and intracortical lesions were manually segmented. FreeSurfer was used to segment the CC and topographically classify lesions per lobe or as deep white matter lesions. Regression models were calculated to predict focal CC atrophy. Results: The frontal and parietal lobes contained the majority (≥80%) of all lesion classifications in both relapsing-remitting and secondary progressive MS subtypes. The anterior subsection of the CC had the smallest proportional volume difference between subtypes (11%). Deep, temporal, and occipital white matter lesions, and occipital intracortical lesions were the strongest predictors of middle-posterior callosal atrophy (adjusted R<sup>2</sup> =.54-.39, P &lt;.01). Conclusions: Both white matter and cortical lesions contribute to regional corpus callosal atrophy. The lobe-specific lesion topology does not fully explain the inhomogeneous CC atrophy. © 2022 The Authors.

45,2-s2.0-85123952085,Bridging the callosal gap in gait: corpus callosum white matter integrity’s role in lower limb coordination,"<p>Bilateral coordination of the lower extremities is an essential component of mobility. The corpus callosum bridges the two hemispheres of the brain and is integral for the coordination of such complex movements. The aim of this project was to assess structural integrity of the transcallosal sensorimotor fiber tracts and identify their associations with gait coordination using novel methods of ecologically valid mobility assessments in persons with multiple sclerosis and age−/gender-matched neurotypical adults. Neurotypical adults (n = 29) and persons with multiple sclerosis (n = 27) underwent gait and diffusion tensor imaging assessments; the lower limb coordination via Phase Coordination Index, and radial diffusivity, an indirect marker of myelination, were applied as the primary outcome measures. Persons with multiple sclerosis possessed poorer transcallosal white matter microstructural integrity of sensorimotor fiber tracts compared to the neurotypical adults. Further, persons with multiple sclerosis demonstrated significantly poorer bilateral coordination of the lower limbs during over-ground walking in comparison to an age and gender-matched neurotypical cohort. Finally, bilateral coordination of the lower limbs was significantly associated with white matter microstructural integrity of the dorsal premotor and primary motor fiber bundles in persons with multiple sclerosis, but not in neurotypical adults. This analysis revealed that persons with multiple sclerosis exhibit poorer transcallosal microstructural integrity than neurotypical peers. Furthermore, these structural deficits were correlated to poorer consistency and accuracy of gait in those with multiple sclerosis. Together, these results, emphasize the importance of transcallosal communication for gait coordination in those with multiple sclerosis. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.</p>"
46,2-s2.0-85123723211,Automatic deep learning multicontrast corpus callosum segmentation in multiple sclerosis,"<p>Background and Purpose: Corpus callosum (CC) atrophy is predictive of future disability in multiple sclerosis (MS). However, current segmentation methods are either labor- or computationally intensive. We therefore developed an automated deep learning-based CC segmentation tool and hypothesized that its output would correlate with disability. Methods: A cohort of 631 MS patients (449 females, baseline age 41 ± 11 years) with both 3-dimensional T1-weighted and T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) MRI was used for the development. Data from 204 patients were manually segmented to train convolutional neural networks in extracting the midsagittal intracranial and CC areas. Remaining data were used to compare segmentations with FreeSurfer and benchmark the outputs with regard to clinical correlations. A 1.5 and 3 Tesla reproducibility cohort of 9 MS patients evaluated the segmentation robustness. Results: The deep learning-based tool was accurate in selecting the appropriate slice for segmentation (98% accuracy within 3 mm of the manual ground truth) and segmenting the CC (Dice coefficient.88-.91) and intracranial areas (.97-.98). The accuracy was lower with higher atrophy. Reproducibility was excellent (intraclass correlation coefficient &gt;.90) for T1-weighted scans and moderate-good for FLAIR (.74-.75). Segmentations were associated with baseline and future (average follow-up time 6-7 years) Expanded Disability Status Scale (ρ = –.13 to –.24) and Symbol Digit Modalities Test (r =.18-.29) scores. Conclusions: We present a fully automatic deep learning-based CC segmentation tool optimized to modern imaging in MS with clinical correlations on par with computationally expensive alternatives. © 2022 The Authors.

47,2-s2.0-85123654709,Corpus callosum volumetrics and clinical progression in early multiple sclerosis,"<p>OBJECTIVE: Corpus callosum (CC) is commonly affected in multiple sclerosis (MS), with known association between CC atrophy and MS clinical activity. In this study, we assessed the association of callosal atrophy, lesions volume and residual CC volume with the clinical disability of early MS patients. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Thirteen MS subjects (9 female, mean age 36.9 years), studied with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were selected. MRI scans were performed at baseline (T<sub>0</sub>), at 6 (T<sub>1</sub>), 12 (T<sub>2</sub>), and 24 months (T<sub>3</sub>) from baseline. CC was segmented into three sections (genu, body, and splenium); callosal boundaries were outlined and all CC lesions were manually traced. Normal CC and CC lesion volumes were measured using a semiautomatic software. RESULTS: From January 2014 to December 2016, all selected patients had confluent lesions on MRI at T3 with a significant increase in the size of confluent lesions compared to baseline (p=0.0007). At T1, a significant increase in the size of confluent (p=0.02) and single lesions located in the callosal body (p=0.04) was detected in patients with EDSS ≥1.5. Also, CC residual volume (CCR) rather than the whole CC volume (CCV) significantly correlated (p=0.03) with the clinical progression of MS in the whole cohort. CONCLUSIONS: In early MS patients with higher EDSS at baseline, a significant increase in confluent CC lesions size is evident, particularly in the callosal body. Also, median CCR is significantly associated with MS progression in the whole MS group, regardless of initial EDSS. Given their significant association with disability, we encourage measuring CC body lesions and residual CC size for therapeutic decisions and prognostic planning in early MS. © 2022 Verduci Editore s.r.l.

48,2-s2.0-85123323986,Longitudinal Imaging of T Cells and Inflammatory Demyelination in a Preclinical Model of Multiple Sclerosis Using <sup>18</sup>F-FAraG PET and MRI,"<p>Lymphocytes and innate immune cells are key drivers of multiple sclerosis (MS) and are the main target of MS disease-modifying therapies (DMT). Ex vivo analyses of MS lesions have revealed cellular heterogeneity and variable T cell levels, which may have important implications for patient stratification and choice of DMT. Although MRI has proven valuable to monitor DMT efficacy, its lack of specificity for cellular subtypes highlights the need for complementary methods to improve lesion characterization. Here, we evaluated the potential of 2<sup>9</sup>-deoxy-2<sup>9</sup>-<sup>18</sup>F-fluoro-9-b-D-arabinofuranosylguanine (<sup>18</sup>F-FAraG) PET imaging to noninvasively assess infiltrating T cells and to provide, in combination with MRI, a novel tool to determine lesion types. Methods: We used a novel MS mouse model that combines cuprizone and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis to reproducibly induce 2 brain inflammatory lesion types, differentiated by their T cell content. <sup>18</sup>F-FAraG PET imaging, T2-weighted MRI, and T1-weighted contrast-enhanced MRI were performed before disease induction, during demyelination with high levels of innate immune cells, and after T cell infiltration. Fingolimod immunotherapy was used to evaluate the ability of PET and MRI to detect therapy response. Ex vivo immunofluorescence analyses for T cells, microglia/macrophages, myelin, and blood–brain barrier (BBB) integrity were performed to validate the in vivo findings. Results: <sup>18</sup>F-FAraG signal was significantly increased in the brain and spinal cord at the time point of T cell infiltration. <sup>18</sup>F-FAraG signal from white matter (corpus callosum) and gray matter (cortex, hippocampus) further correlated with T cell density. T2-weighted MRI detected white matter lesions independently of T cells. T1-weighted contrast-enhanced MRI indicated BBB disruption at the time point of T cell infiltration. Fingolimod treatment prevented motor deficits and decreased T cell and microglia/macrophage levels. In agreement, <sup>18</sup>F-FAraG signal was decreased in the brain and spinal cord of fingolimod-treated mice; T1-weighted contrast-enhanced MRI revealed intact BBB, whereas T2-weighted MRI findings remained unchanged. Conclusion: The combination of MRI and <sup>18</sup>F-FAraG PET enables detection of inflammatory demyelination and T cell infiltration in an MS mouse model, providing a new way to evaluate lesion heterogeneity during disease progression and after DMT. On clinical translation, these methods hold great potential for stratifying patients, monitoring MS progression, and determining therapy responses.

49,2-s2.0-85122408212,Usefulness of two-dimensional measurements for the evaluation of brain volume and disability in multiple sclerosis,"<p>Background: Two-dimensional (2D) measures have been proposed as potential proxies for whole-brain volume in multiple sclerosis (MS). Objective: To verify whether 2D measurements by routine MRI are useful in predicting brain volume or disability in MS. Methods: In this cross-sectional analysis, eighty-five consecutive Japanese MS patients—relapsing-remitting MS (81%) and progressive MS (19%)—underwent 1.5 Tesla T1-weighted 3D MRI examinations to measure whole-brain and grey matter volume. 2D measurements, namely, third ventricle width, lateral ventricle width (LVW), brain width, bicaudate ratio, and corpus callosum index (CCI), were obtained from each scan. Correlations between 2D measurements and 3D measurements, the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), or processing speed were analysed. Results: The third and lateral ventricle widths were well-correlated with the whole-brain volume (p &lt; 0.0001), grey matter volume (p &lt; 0.0001), and EDSS scores (p = 0.0001, p =.0004, respectively).The least squares regression model revealed that 78% of the variation in whole-brain volume could be explained using five explanatory variables, namely, LVW, CCI, age, sex, and disease duration. By contrast, the partial correlation coefficient excluding the effect of age showed that the CCI was significantly correlated with the EDSS and processing speed (p &lt; 0.0001). Conclusion: Ventricle width correlated well with brain volumes, while the CCI correlated well with age-independent (i.e. disease-induced) disability. © The Author(s), 2022.</p>"
50,2-s2.0-85120895101,Connection between microstructural alterations detected by diffusion MRI and cognitive dysfunction in MS: A model-free analysis approach,"<p>Background: Cognitive decline is a prominent symptom of MS. Clear connection between cognitive status and white matter microstructural changes has not been unequivocally observed to date. Objective: To characterise the relationship between white matter microstructure and cognitive performance a partial least squares (PLS) approach was used. Methods: 53 RR MS patients’ T1 and DTI images and BICAMS subtests were used in our analysis. Standard FSL pipeline was used to obtain diffusion parameters. A PLS approach was applied to reveal the diffusion parameter patterns responsible for the cognitive dysfunction. Results: The first latent variable (LV) was mainly associated with demyelination, while the second and third explained axonal damage. While the first two LV represented mainly Brief Visuospatial Memory Test (BVMT) and Single Digit Modality Test (SDMT), the third LV depicted diffusion alterations mainly the verbal subtest. The first LVs spatial map showed demyelination in the corpus callosum. The second LVs spatial map showed the diffusion alterations in the thalamus. The third LV depicted diffusion alterations in the putative left superior longitudinal fascicle. Conclusion: Visual memory demanding tasks versus language functions depend on distinct patterns of diffusion parameters and the spatial organisation. Axial diffusivity alterations, a putative marker of irreversible axonal loss explained around 20% of variability in the cognitive functions. © 2021</p>"
51,2-s2.0-85120863890,Brain Plasticity in fMRI and DTI,"<p>This chapter gives an overview of the type of neuroplastic information that can be generated by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) after damage of the central or peripheral nervous system. After an introductory overview about clinical neuroplasticity, benefits of neuroplastic investigations are demonstrated. Thereby, a better evaluation of the patient’s functional state, better individual prognosis, a progression in understanding the nervous system, as well as ameliorated treatment strategies are outlined. Afterwards, some important cellular and molecular mechanisms relevant for neuroplastic changes are discussed, since fMRI and DTI are limited to identifying neuroplasticity on a level of neuronal populations and their connections. Finally, a review about neuroplastic changes, in response to nervous system disease, is given. The review is completed by demonstrating a new, promising therapeutic approach supporting brain plasticity, for which fMRI and DTI data are important. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.</p>"
52,2-s2.0-85119429779,Drug connectivity mapping and functional analysis reveal therapeutic small molecules that differentially modulate myelination,"<p>Disruption or loss of oligodendrocytes (OLs) and myelin has devastating effects on CNS function and integrity, which occur in diverse neurological disorders, including Multiple Sclerosis (MS), Alzheimer's disease and neuropsychiatric disorders. Hence, there is a need to develop new therapies that promote oligodendrocyte regeneration and myelin repair. A promising approach is drug repurposing, but most agents have potentially contrasting biological actions depending on the cellular context and their dose-dependent effects on intracellular pathways. Here, we have used a combined systems biology and neurobiological approach to identify compounds that exert positive and negative effects on oligodendroglia, depending on concentration. Notably, next generation pharmacogenomic analysis identified the PI3K/Akt modulator LY294002 as the most highly ranked small molecule with both pro- and anti-oligodendroglial concentration-dependent effects. We validated these in silico findings using multidisciplinary approaches to reveal a profoundly bipartite effect of LY294002 on the generation of OPCs and their differentiation into myelinating oligodendrocytes in both postnatal and adult contexts. Finally, we employed transcriptional profiling and signalling pathway activity assays to determine cell-specific mechanisms of action of LY294002 on oligodendrocytes and resolve optimal in vivo conditions required to promote myelin repair. These results demonstrate the power of multidisciplinary strategies in determining the therapeutic potential of small molecules in neurodegenerative disorders. © 2021 The Authors</p>"
53,2-s2.0-85118804885,Enhanced re-myelination in transthyretin null mice following cuprizone mediated demyelination,"<p>Thyroid hormones (THs) impact nearly every tissue in the body, including the adult and developing central nervous system. The distribution of THs around the body is facilitated by specific TH distributor proteins including transthyretin (TTR). In addition to being produced in the liver, TTR is synthesized in the choroid plexus of the brain. The synthesis of TTR by choroid plexus epithelial cells allows transport of THs from the blood into the brain. Adequate supply of THs to the brain is required for developmental myelination of axons and the maintenance of mature myelin throughout adult life, essential for the proper conduction of nerve impulses. Insufficient THs in developing mice results in hypo-myelination (thinner myelin around axons). However, confounding evidence demonstrated that in developing brain of TTR null mice, hyper-myelination of axons was observed in the corpus callosum. This raised the question whether increased myelination occurs during re-myelination in the adult brain following targeted demyelination. To investigate the effect of TTR during re-myelination, cuprizone induced depletion of myelin in the corpus callosum of adult mice was initiated, followed by a period of myelin repair. Myelin thickness was measured to assess re-myelination rates for 6 weeks. TTR null mice displayed expedited rates of early re-myelination, preferentially re-myelinating smaller axons compared to those of wild type mice. Furthermore, TTR null mice produced thicker myelin than wild type mice during re-myelination. These results may have broader implications in understanding mechanisms governing re-myelination, particularly in potential therapeutic contexts for acquired demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis. © 2021</p>"

Different neuroimaging methods have been used to quantify myelin and relate it to cognitive dysfunctions, among them Magnetization Transfer Ratio (MTR), Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI), and, more recently, Positron Emission Tomography (PET) with <sup>11</sup>C-PIB. Objective: To investigate different myelin imaging modalities as predictors of cognitive dysfunction. Methods: Fifty-one MS patients and 24 healthy controls underwent clinical and neuropsychological assessment and MTR, DTI (Axial Diffusion-AD and Fractional Anisotropy-FA maps), and <sup>11</sup>C-PIB PET images in a PET/MR hybrid system. Results: MTR and DTI(FA) differed in patients with or without cognitive impairment. There was an association of DTI(FA) and DTI(AD) with cognition and psychomotor speed for progressive MS, and of <sup>11</sup>C-PIB uptake and MTR for relapsing-remitting MS. MTR in the Thalamus (β= -0.51, p = 0.021) and Corpus Callosum (β= -0.24, p = 0.033) were predictive of cognitive impairment. DTI-FA in the Caudate (β= -26.93, p = 0.006) presented abnormal predictive result. Conclusion: Lower myelin content by <sup>11</sup>C-PIB uptake was associated with worse cognitive status.

55,2-s2.0-85117407130,Exosomes derived from bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells promote remyelination and reduce neuroinflammation in the demyelinating central nervous system,"<p>Injury of oligodendrocytes (OLs) induces demyelination, and patients with neurodegenerative diseases exhibit demyelination concomitantly with neurological deficit and cognitive impairment. Oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) are present in the adult central nervous system (CNS), and they can proliferate, differentiate, and remyelinate axons after damage. However, remyelination therapies are not in clinical use. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a major demyelinating disease in the CNS. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) have demonstrated therapeutic promise in animal models and in clinical trials of MS. Exosomes are nanoparticles generated by nearly all cells and they mediate cell-cell communication by transferring cargo biomaterials. Here, we hypothesize that exosomes harvested from MSCs have a similar therapeutic effect on enhancement of remyelination as that of MSCs. In the present study we employed exosomes derived from rhesus monkey MSCs (MSC-Exo). Two mouse models of demyelination were employed: 1) experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of MS; and 2) cuprizone (CPZ) diet model, a toxic demyelination model. MSC-Exo or PBS were intravenously injected twice a week for 4 weeks, starting on day 10 post immunization in EAE mice, or once a week for 2 weeks starting on the day of CPZ diet withdrawal. Neurological and cognitive function were tested, OPC differentiation and remyelination, neuroinflammation and the potential underlying mechanisms were investigated using immunofluorescent staining, transmission electron microscopy and Western blot. Data generated from the EAE model revealed that MSC-Exo cross the blood brain barrier (BBB) and target neural cells. Compared with the controls (p &lt; 0.05), treatment with MSC-Exo: 1) significantly improved neurological outcome; 2) significantly increased the numbers of newly generated OLs (BrdU<sup>+</sup>/APC<sup>+</sup>) and mature OLs (APC<sup>+</sup>), and the level of myelin basic protein (MBP); 3) decreased amyloid-β precursor protein (APP)<sup>+</sup> density; 4) decreased neuroinflammation by increasing the M2 phenotype and decreasing the M1 phenotype of microglia, as well as their related cytokines; 5) inhibited the TLR2/IRAK1/NFκB pathway. Furthermore, we confirmed that the MSC-Exo treatment significantly improved cognitive function, promoted remyelination, increased polarization of M2 phenotype and blocked TLR2 signaling in the CPZ model. Collectively, MSC-Exo treatment promotes remyelination by both directly acting on OPCs and indirectly by acting on microglia in the demyelinating CNS. This study provides the cellular and molecular basis for this cell-free exosome therapy on remyelination and modulation of neuroinflammation in the CNS, with great potential for treatment of demyelinating and neurodegenerative disorders. © 2021</p>"
56,2-s2.0-85111875687,Fast Univariate Inference for Longitudinal Functional Models,"<p>We propose fast univariate inferential approaches for longitudinal Gaussian and non-Gaussian functional data. The approach consists of three steps: (i) fit massively univariate pointwise mixed-effects models; (ii) apply any smoother along the functional domain; and (iii) obtain joint confidence bands using analytic approaches for Gaussian data or a bootstrap of study participants for non-Gaussian data. Methods are motivated by two applications: (i) Diffusion tensor imaging measured at multiple visits along the corpus callosum of multiple sclerosis patients; and (ii) physical activity (PA) data measured by body-worn accelerometers for multiple days. An extensive simulation study indicates that model fitting and inference are accurate and much faster than existing approaches. Moreover, the proposed approach was the only one that was computationally feasible for the PA data application. Methods are accompanied by R software, though the method is “read-and-use,” as it can be implemented by any analyst who is familiar with mixed-effects model software.

58,2-s2.0-85106735468,Elucidating distinct clinico-radiologic signatures in the borderland between neuromyelitis optica and multiple sclerosis,"<p>Background: Separating antibody-negative neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders (NMOSD) from multiple sclerosis (MS) in borderline cases is extremely challenging due to lack of biomarkers. Elucidating different pathologies within the likely heterogenous antibody-negative NMOSD/MS overlap syndrome is, therefore, a major unmet need which would help avoid disability from inappropriate treatment. Objective: In this study we aimed to identify distinct subgroups within the antibody-negative NMOSD/MS overlap syndrome. Methods: Twenty-five relapsing antibody-negative patients with NMOSD features underwent a prospective brain and spinal cord MRI. Subgroups were identified by an unsupervised algorithm based on pre-selected NMOSD/MS discriminators. Results: Four subgroups were identified. Patients from Group 1 termed “MS-like” (n = 6) often had central vein sign and cortical lesions (83% and 67%, respectively). All patients from Group 2 (“spinal MS-like”, 8) had short-segment myelitis and no MS-like brain lesions. Group 3 (“classic NMO-like”, 6) had high percentage of bilateral optic neuritis and longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis (LETM, 80% and 60%, respectively) and normal brain appearance (100%). Group 4 (“NMO-like with brain involvement”, 5) typically had a history of NMOSD-like brain lesions and LETM. When compared with other groups, Group 4 had significantly decreased fractional anisotropy in non-lesioned tracts (0.46 vs. 0.49, p = 0.003) and decreased thalamus volume (0.84 vs. 0.98, p = 0.04). Conclusions: NMOSD/MS cohort contains distinct subgroups likely corresponding to different pathologies and requiring tailored treatment. We propose that non-conventional MRI might help optimise diagnosis in these challenging patients. © 2021, The Author(s).</p>"
59,2-s2.0-85104814287,Central vein sign and other radiographic features distinguishing myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody disease from multiple sclerosis and aquaporin-4 antibody-positive neuromyelitis optica,"<p>Background: Myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody disease (MOGAD) can radiographically mimic multiple sclerosis (MS) and aquaporin-4 (AQP4) antibody-positive neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD). Central vein sign (CVS) prevalence has not yet been well-established in MOGAD. Objective: Characterize the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) appearance and CVS prevalence of MOGAD patients in comparison to matched cohorts of MS and AQP4+ NMOSD. Methods: Clinical MRIs from 26 MOGAD patients were compared to matched cohorts of MS and AQP4+ NMOSD. Brain MRIs were assessed for involvement within predefined regions of interest. CVS was assessed by overlaying fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) and susceptibility-weighted sequences. Topographic analyses were performed on spinal cord and orbital MRIs when available. Results: MOGAD patients had fewer brain lesions and average CVS+ rate of 12.1%, compared to 44.4% in MS patients (p = 0.0008). MOGAD spinal cord and optic nerve involvement was lengthier than MS (5.8 vs 1.0 vertebral segments, p = 0.020; 3.0 vs 0.5 cm, p &lt; 0.0001). MOGAD patients tended to have bilateral/anterior optic nerve pathology with perineural contrast enhancement, contrasting with posterior optic nerve involvement in NMOSD. Conclusion: CVS+ rate and longer segments of involvement in the spinal cord and optic nerve can differentiate MOGAD from MS, but do not discriminate as well between MOGAD and AQP4+ NMOSD. © The Author(s), 2021.</p>"

There is an urgent need to develop remyelinating therapies to better treat multiple sclerosis and other demyelinating diseases. The kappa opioid receptor (KOR) has been identified as a potential target for the development of remyelinating therapies; however, prototypical KOR agonists, such as U50,488 have side effects, which limit clinical use. In the current study, we investigated a Salvinorin A analog, ethoxymethyl ether Salvinorin B (EOM SalB) in two preclinical models of demyelination in C57BL/6J mice. We showed that in cellular assays EOM SalB was G-protein biased, an effect often correlated with fewer KOR-mediated side effects. In the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis model, we found that EOM SalB (0.1–0.3 mg/kg) effectively decreased disease severity in a KOR-dependent manner and led to a greater number of animals in recovery compared to U50,488 treatment. Furthermore, EOM SalB treatment decreased immune cell infiltration and increased myelin levels in the central nervous system. In the cuprizone-induced demyelination model, we showed that EOM SalB (0.3 mg/kg) administration led to an increase in the number of mature oligodendrocytes, the number of myelinated axons and the myelin thickness in the corpus callosum. Overall, EOM SalB was effective in two preclinical models of multiple sclerosis and demyelination, adding further evidence to show KOR agonists are a promising target for remyelinating therapies.

61,2-s2.0-85118498636,A biocompatible and injectable hydrogel to boost the efficacy of stem cells in neurodegenerative diseases treatment,"<p>Aims: Stem cell therapies emerged as treatment modalities with potential to cure neurodegenerative diseases (NDs). However, despite high expectations, their clinical use is still limited. Critical issues in treatment outcomes may be related to stem cells formulation and administration route. We develop a hydrogel as a cell carrier, consisting of compounds (phospholipids and hyaluronic acid-HA) naturally present in the central nervous system (CNS). The HA-based hydrogel physically crosslinked with liposomes is designed for direct injection into the CNS to significantly increase the bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) bioavailability. Materials and methods: Hydrogel compatibility is confirmed in vitro with BMSCs and in vivo through its intracerebroventricular injection in rats. To assess its efficacy, the main cause of chronic neurologic disability in young adults is selected, namely multiple sclerosis (MS). The efficacy of the developed formulation containing a lower number of cells than previously reported is demonstrated using an experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) rat model. Key findings: The distribution of the engineered hydrogel into corpus callosum can be ideal for NDs treatment, since damage of this white matter structure is responsible for important neuronal deficits. Moreover, the BMSCs-laden hydrogel significantly decreases disease severity and maximum clinical score and eliminated the relapse. Significance: The engineering of advanced therapies using this natural carrier can result in efficacious treatments for MS and related debilitating conditions. © 2021</p>"
62,2-s2.0-85116886691,Sex-specific disruption in corticospinal excitability and hemispheric (a)symmetry in multiple sclerosis,"<p>Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a neurodegenerative disease in which pathophysiology and symptom progression presents differently between the sexes. In a cohort of people with MS (n = 110), we used transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to investigate sex differences in corticospinal excitability (CSE) and sex-specific relationships between CSE and cognitive function. Although demographics and disease characteristics did not differ between sexes, males were more likely to have cognitive impairment as measured by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA); 53.3% compared to females at 26.3%. Greater CSE asymmetry was noted in females compared to males. Females demonstrated higher active motor thresholds and longer silent periods in the hemisphere corresponding to the weaker hand which was more typical of hand dominance patterns in healthy individuals. Males, but not females, exhibited asymmetry of nerve conduction latency (delayed MEP latency in the hemisphere corresponding to the weaker hand). In males, there was also a relationship between delayed onset of ipsilateral silent period (measured in the hemisphere corresponding to the weaker hand) and MoCA, suggestive of cross-callosal disruption. Our findings support that a sex-specific disruption in CSE exists in MS, pointing to interhemispheric disruption as a potential biomarker of cognitive impairment and target for neuromodulating therapies. © 2021</p>"

Therefore, a radiotracer specific for MERTK could be of great utility in the clinical management of MS, for the detection and differentiation of neuroregenerative and neurodegenerative processes. This study aimed to develop an [<sup>18</sup>F] ligand with high affinity and selectivity for MERTK as a potential positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracer. MIPS15691 and MIPS15692 were synthesized and kinase assays were utilized to determine potency and selectivity for MERTK. Both compounds were shown to be potent against MERTK, with respective IC<sub>50</sub> values of 4.6 nM and 4.0 nM, and were also MERTK-selective. Plasma and brain pharmacokinetics were measured in mice and led to selection of MIPS15692 over MIPS15691. X-ray crystallography was used to visualize how MIPS15692 is recognized by the enzyme. [<sup>18</sup>F]MIPS15692 was synthesized using an automated iPHASE FlexLab module, with a molar activity (A<sub>m</sub>) of 49 ± 26 GBq/μmol. The radiochemical purity of [<sup>18</sup>F]MIPS15692 was &gt;99% and the decay-corrected radiochemical yields (RCYs) were determined as 2.45 ± 0.85%. Brain MERTK protein density was measured by a saturation binding assay in the brain slices of a cuprizone mouse model of MS. High levels of specific binding of [<sup>18</sup>F]MIPS15692 to MERTK were found, especially in the corpus callosum/hippocampus (CC/HC). The in vivo PET imaging study of [<sup>18</sup>F]MIPS15692 suggested that its neuroPK is sub-optimal for clinical use. Current efforts are underway to optimize the neuroPK of our next generation PET radiotracers for maximal in vivo utility. © 2021</p>"
64,2-s2.0-85125903399,Royal jelly attenuated cognitive and non-cognitive deficits and blood-brain barrier disruption induced by ethidium bromide,"<p>Introduction: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease. The main aims of the present investigation were to evaluate the effect of royal jelly (RJ) on cognitive and non-cognitive behavior, demyelination and the level of blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption induced by ethidium bromide (EB). Methods: Twenty-five adult male Sprague Dawley in five groups were used. Control (intact rat); Sham (surgery without EB injection); treatment control (EB injection without treatment); treatment1 and treatment2 (orally administered of RJ 100 and 200 mg/kg/day after EB injection). EB (3µl of 0.01%) injection in the dentate gyrus (DG) was used for demyelination. Demyelination induction was proved by histological examination. For the estimation of BBB integrity, Evans blue extravasation was done using an ELISA reader. Cognitive and non-cognitive behavior was evaluated by Morris water maze. Results: Data showed that RJ corrected the deficit of demyelination. Cognitive and non-cognitive behavior improved in treatment groups relative to treatment control by RJ. The extent of BBB disruption significantly improved in treatment groups compared to the treatment control group, in the whole brain and hippocampus. Conclusion: Results indicate that RJ after EB injection in DG can improve cognitive and non-cognitive behavior, demyelination and BBB disruption in rat after EB injection. Therefore, it seems that RJ can be a supplementary drug for MS. © 2021, Iranian Society of Physiology and Pharmacology. All rights reserved.</p>"
65,2-s2.0-85123323963,Imaging and Clinical Features of Neurocutaneous Melanosis in the Pediatric Population,"<p>Background: Neurocutaneous Melanosis (NCM) is a rare nonfamilial phakomatosis characterized by the presence of congenital melanocytic nevi and abnormal melanocyte infiltration of the leptomeninges. Objective and Methods: This paper shows the importance of early diagnosis and the most important imaging features of the disease on CT and MR scans. PubMed database was searched from January 1972 to September 2020. Papers including imaging findings of NCM, clinical, follow-up, and treatment features were collected, selecting only 89 studies. Discussion: NCM is a term used for the first time by van Bogaert in 1948. It refers to a condition caused by an error during morphogenesis and migration leading to leptomeningeal melanocytic accumulation. Although histological findings are the gold standard for diagnosis confirmation, neuroimaging and clinical features strongly support the suspect of NCM. Localization and extension of the lesions are predictive of neurological manifestations related to increased intracranial pressure, mass lesions, or spinal cord compression. CT demonstrates sites of increased density in the anterior temporal lobe, mainly the amygdala, thalami, cerebellum, and frontal lobes base. However, MRI is the best imaging method to diagnose central nervous system lesions, often appearing as T1-short signal areas of the cerebral parenchyma, indicative of central nervous system melanosis. MRI can also reveal associated intracranial and intraspinal abnormalities. Conclusion: Early imaging, when available, is helpful if NCM suspect is raised and may be of guidance in comparing later studies. NCM requires a multidisciplinary approach since it is a multisystem disease with a genetic component. © 2021 Bentham Science Publishers.</p>"
66,2-s2.0-85119898935,"Differential role of p53 in oligodendrocyte survival in response to various stresses: Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, cuprizone intoxication or white matter stroke","<p>Promoting oligodendrocyte viability has been proposed as a therapeutic strategy for allevi-ating many neuronal diseases, such as multiple sclerosis and stroke. However, molecular pathways critical for oligodendrocyte survival under various stresses are still not well known. p53 is a strong tumor suppressor and regulates cell cycle, DNA repair and cell death. Our previous studies have shown that p53 plays an important role in promoting neuronal survival after insults, but its specific role in oligodendrocyte survival is not known. Here, we constructed the mice with oligodendrocyte-specific p53 loss by crossing TRP53<sup>flox/flox</sup> mice and CNP-cre mice, and found that p53 was dispensable for oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelin formation under physiological condition. In the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model, p53 loss of function, specifically in oligodendrocytes, did not affect the EAE disease severity and had no effect on demyelination in the spinal cord of the mice. Interestingly, p53 deficiency in oligodendrocytes significantly attenuated the demyelination of corpus callosum and alleviated the functional impairment of motor coordination and spatial memory in the cuprizone demyelination model. Moreover, the oligodendrocyte-specific loss of p53 provided protection against subcortical white matter damage and mitigated recognition memory impairment in mice in the white matter stroke model. These results suggest that p53 plays different roles in the brain and spinal cord or in response to various stresses. Thus, p53 may be a therapeutic target for oligodendrocyte prevention in specific brain injuries, such as white matter stroke and multiple sclerosis. © 2021 by the authors.

67,2-s2.0-85119480985,Cuprizone feed formulation influences the extent of demyelinating disease pathology,"<p>Cuprizone is a copper-chelating agent that induces pathology similar to that within some multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions. The reliability and reproducibility of cuprizone for inducing demyelinating disease pathology depends on the animals ingesting consistent doses of cuprizone. Cuprizone-containing pelleted feed is a convenient way of delivering cuprizone, but the efficacy of these pellets at inducing demyelination has been questioned. This study compared the degree of demyelinating disease pathology between mice fed cuprizone delivered in pellets to mice fed a powdered cuprizone formulation at an early 3 week demyelinating timepoint. Within rostral corpus callosum, cuprizone pellets were more effective than cuprizone powder at increasing astrogliosis, microglial activation, DNA damage, and decreasing the density of mature oligodendrocytes. However, cuprizone powder demonstrated greater protein nitration relative to controls. Furthermore, mice fed control powder had significantly fewer mature oligodendrocytes than those fed control pellets. In caudal corpus callosum, cuprizone pellets performed better than cuprizone powder relative to controls at increasing astrogliosis, microglial activation, protein nitration, DNA damage, tissue swelling, and reducing the density of mature oligodendrocytes. Importantly, only cuprizone pellets induced detectable demyelination compared to controls. The two feeds had similar effects on oligodendrocyte precursor cell (OPC) dynamics. Taken together, these data suggest that demyelinating disease pathology is modelled more effectively with cuprizone pellets than powder at 3 weeks. Combined with the added convenience, cuprizone pellets are a suitable choice for inducing early demyelinating disease pathology. © 2021, The Author(s).</p>"
68,2-s2.0-85117392386,The neural underpinnings of motor learning in people with neurodegenerative diseases: A scoping review,"<p>Chronic progressive neurodegenerative diseases (NDD) cause mobility and cognitive impairments that disrupt quality of life. The learning of new motor skills, motor learning, is a critical component of rehabilitation efforts to counteract these chronic progressive impairments. In people with NDD, there are impairments in motor learning which appear to scale with the severity of impairment. Compensatory cortical activity plays a role in counteracting motor learning impairments in NDD. Yet, the functional and structural brain alterations associated with motor learning have not been synthesized in people with NDD. The purpose of this scoping review is to explore the neural alterations of motor learning in NDD. Thirty-five peer-reviewed original articles met the inclusion criteria. Participant demographics, motor learning results, and brain imaging results were extracted. Distinct motor learning associated compensatory processes were identified across NDD populations. Evidence from this review suggests the success of motor learning in NDD populations depends on the neural alterations and their interaction with motor learning networks, as well as the progression of disease. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd</p>"
69,2-s2.0-85116012010,Antagonizing astrocytic platelet activating factor receptor-neuroinflammation for total flavone of epimedium in response to cuprizone demyelination,"<p>Demyelinating diseases of the central nervous system are characterized by recurrent demyelination and progressive neurodegeneration, but there are no clinical drugs targeting myelin regeneration or improving functional disability in the treatment of multiple sclerosis. Total flavone of Epimedium (TFE) is the main active components of Epimedium, which exhibits the beneficial biological activities in the treatment of diseases, but there is no report in the treatment of demyelinating disorder. The purpose of this study was to explore the therapeutic potential and possible mechanism of TFE in the treatment of demyelination. The results showed that TFE efficiently improved the behavioural performance and histological demyelination in cuprizone (CPZ)-induced demyelinating model. In terms of action, TFE increased astrocytes enrichment in corpus callosum, striatum and cortex, and promoted astrocytes to express neurotrophic factors. Furthermore, the expression of platelet-activating factor receptor (PAFR) in astrocytes was induced by CPZ feeding and LPS stimulation, accompanied by the increase of inflammatory cytokines TNF-α,IL-6 and IL-1β. TFE declined the expression of PAFR, and inhibited inflammatory response. At the same time, TFE also antagonized PAFR activation and inflammatory response triggered by PAF, which further confirmed that TFE, as a new PAFR antagonist, inhibited the astrocyte-derived inflammatory response by antagonizing PAFR-neuroinflammation axis, thus contributing to myelin protection and regeneration. © 2021</p>"
70,2-s2.0-85115867020,Metformin Therapy Attenuates Pro-inflammatory Microglia by Inhibiting NF-κB in Cuprizone Demyelinating Mouse Model of Multiple Sclerosis,"<p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic disorder characterized by reactive gliosis, inflammation, and demyelination. Microglia plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of MS and has the dynamic plasticity to polarize between pro-inflammatory (M1) and anti-inflammatory (M2) phenotypes. Metformin, a glucose-lowering drug, attenuates inflammatory responses by activating adenosine monophosphate protein kinase (AMPK) which suppresses nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB). In this study, we indirectly investigated whether metformin therapy would regulate microglia activity in the cuprizone (CPZ)-induced demyelination mouse model of MS via measuring the markers associated with pro- and anti-inflammatory microglia. Evaluation of myelin by luxol fast blue staining revealed that metformin treatment (CPZ + Met) diminished demyelination, in comparison to CPZ mice. In addition, metformin therapy significantly alleviated reactive microgliosis and astrogliosis in the corpus callosum, as measured by Iba-1 and GFAP staining. Moreover, metformin treatment significantly downregulated the expression of pro-inflammatory associated genes (iNOS, H2-Aa, and TNF-α) in the corpus callosum, whereas expression of anti-inflammatory markers (Arg1, Mrc1, and IL10) was not promoted, compared to CPZ mice. Furthermore, protein levels of iNOS (pro-inflammatory marker) were significantly decreased in the metformin group, while those of Trem2 (anti-inflammatory marker) were increased. In addition, metformin significantly increased AMPK activation in CPZ mice. Finally, metformin administration significantly reduced the activation level of NF-κB in CPZ mice. In summary, our data revealed that metformin attenuated pro-inflammatory microglia markers through suppressing NF-κB activity. The positive effects of metformin on microglia and remyelination suggest that it could be used as a promising candidate to lessen the incidence of inflammatory neurodegenerative diseases such as MS. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.</p>"
71,2-s2.0-85114513278,Cognitive impairment and depression in patients with relapsing–remitting multiple sclerosis depending on age and neuroimaging findings,"<p>Background: Multiple sclerosis is an insidious, disabling, both physically and mentally, demyelinating disease of the central nervous system. This work aims to evaluate relationships between cognitive impairment in separate domains, depression and their correspondence with MRI-findings, as well as the influence on each other’s manifestations, in patients with relapsing–remitting multiple sclerosis. Results: Visual–spatial/executive functions and memory domains suffered more frequently than others in the study subjects under 40 years; in patients over 40 years old memory, visual–spatial/executive functions and abstract thinking impairment prevailed the most. Such cognitive domains as memory, language, abstract thinking, visual–spatial and executive functions were impacted in both groups of patients even without the apparent cognitive decline according to MoCA scale. Presence of depression impacted language and attention more prominently than the rest of the domains only in participants younger 40 years. According to the MRI, frontal lobe, corpus callosum and periventricular area were affected more often compared to other brain regions in case of cognitive impairment; meanwhile, combined lesions of frontal lobe and corpus callosum, fronto-temporal region were associated with depression. Conclusion: Cognitive impairment and depression are one of the common, yet disabling and socially disrupting manifestations of MS. Quite frequently such complaints are neglected or considered as parts of comorbidities. At the same time cognitive impairment can be amplified by depression, especially in patients under 40 years. © 2021, The Author(s).</p>"
72,2-s2.0-85112409365,Sphingosine kinase 2 is essential for remyelination following cuprizone intoxication,"<p>Therapeutics that promote oligodendrocyte survival and remyelination are needed to restore neurological function in demyelinating diseases. Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) is an essential lipid metabolite that signals through five G-protein coupled receptors. S1P receptor agonists such as Fingolimod are valuable immunosuppressants used to treat multiple sclerosis, and promote oligodendrocyte survival. However, the role for endogenous S1P, synthesized by the enzyme sphingosine kinase 2 (SphK2), in oligodendrocyte survival and myelination has not been established. This study investigated the requirement for SphK2 in oligodendrocyte survival and remyelination using the cuprizone mouse model of acute demyelination, followed by spontaneous remyelination. Oligodendrocyte density did not differ between untreated wild-type (WT) and SphK2 knockout (SphK2<sup>−/−</sup>) mice. However, cuprizone treatment caused significantly greater loss of mature oligodendrocytes in SphK2<sup>−/−</sup> compared to WT mice. Following cuprizone withdrawal, spontaneous remyelination occurred in WT but not SphK2<sup>−/−</sup> mice, even though progenitor and mature oligodendrocyte density increased in both genotypes. Levels of cytotoxic sphingosine and ceramide were higher in the corpus callosum of SphK2<sup>−/−</sup> mice, and in contrast to WT mice, did not decline following cuprizone withdrawal in SphK2<sup>−/−</sup> mice. We also observed a significant reduction in myelin thickness with aging in SphK2<sup>−/−</sup> compared to WT mice. These results provide the first evidence that SphK2, the dominant enzyme catalyzing S1P synthesis in the adult brain, is essential for remyelination following a demyelinating insult and myelin maintenance with aging. We propose that persistently high levels of sphingosine and ceramide, a direct consequence of SphK2 deficiency, may block remyelination. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.</p>"
73,2-s2.0-85109156521,Magnetic resonance imaging in neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder,"<p>Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) is an inflammatory disease of the central nervous system (CNS) associated with antibodies to aquaporin-4 (AQP4), which has distinct clinical, radiological and pathological features, but also has some overlap with multiple sclerosis and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) antibody associated disease. Early recognition of NMOSD is important because of differing responses to both acute and preventive therapy. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging has proved essential in this process. Key MR imaging clues to the diagnosis of NMOSD are longitudinally extensive lesions of the optic nerve (more than half the length) and spinal cord (three or more vertebral segments), bilateral optic nerve lesions and lesions of the optic chiasm, area postrema, floor of the IV ventricle, periaqueductal grey matter, hypothalamus and walls of the III ventricle. Other NMOSD-specific lesions are denoted by their unique morphology: heterogeneous lesions of the corpus callosum, ‘cloud-like’ gadolinium (Gd)-enhancing white matter lesions and ‘bright spotty’ lesions of the spinal cord. Other lesions described in NMOSD, including linear periventricular peri-ependymal lesions and patch subcortical white matter lesions, may be less specific. The use of advanced MR imaging techniques is yielding further useful information regarding focal degeneration of the thalamus and optic radiation in NMOSD and suggests that paramagnetic rim patterns and changes in normal appearing white matter are specific to MS. MR imaging is crucial in the early recognition of NMOSD and in directing testing for AQP4 antibodies and guiding immediate acute treatment decisions. Increasingly, MR imaging is playing a role in diagnosing seronegative cases of NMOSD. © 2021 British Society for Immunology</p>"
74,2-s2.0-85108094107,Anti-CD20 treatment effectively attenuates cortical pathology in a rat model of widespread cortical demyelination,"<p>Background: Cortical demyelination represents a prominent feature of the multiple sclerosis (MS) brain, especially in (late) progressive stages. We recently developed a new rat model that reassembles critical features of cortical pathology characteristic to progressive types of MS. In persons affected by MS, B-cell depleting anti-CD20 therapy proved successful in the relapsing remitting as well as the early progressive course of MS, with respect to reducing the relapse rate and number of newly formed lesions. However, if the development of cortical pathology can be prevented or at least slowed down is still not clear. The main goal of this study was thus to increase our understanding for the mode of action of B-cells and B-cell directed therapy on cortical lesions in our rat model. Methods: For this purpose, we set up two separate experiments, with two different induction modes of B-cell depletion. Brain tissues were analyzed thoroughly using histology. Results: We observed a marked reduction of cortical demyelination, microglial activation, astrocytic reaction, and apoptotic cell loss in anti-CD20 antibody treated groups. At the same time, we noted increased neuronal preservation compared to control groups, indicating a favorable impact of anti-CD20 therapy. Conclusion: These findings might pave the way for further research on the mode of action of B-cells and therefore help to improve therapeutic options for progressive MS. © 2021, The Author(s).</p>"
75,2-s2.0-85106864516,Demyelination and remyelination detected in an alternative cuprizone mouse model of multiple sclerosis with 7.0 T multiparameter magnetic resonance imaging,"<p>The aim of this study was to investigate the mechanisms underlying demyelination and remyelination with 7.0 T multiparameter magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in an alternative cuprizone (CPZ) mouse model of multiple sclerosis (MS). Sixty mice were divided into six groups (n = 10, each), and these groups were imaged with 7.0 T multiparameter MRI and treated with an alternative CPZ administration schedule. T<sub>2</sub>-weighted imaging (T<sub>2</sub>WI), susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI), and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) were used to compare the splenium of the corpus callosum (sCC) among the groups. Prussian blue and Luxol fast blue staining were performed to assess pathology. The correlations of the mean grayscale value (mGSV) of the pathology results and the MRI metrics were analyzed to evaluate the multiparameter MRI results. One-way ANOVA and post hoc comparison showed that the normalized T<sub>2</sub>WI (T<sub>2</sub>-nor), fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), radial diffusivity (RD), and axial diffusivity (AD) values were significantly different among the six groups, while the mean phase (Φ) value of SWI was not significantly different among the groups. Correlation analysis showed that the correlation between the T<sub>2</sub>-nor and mGSV was higher than that among the other values. The correlations among the FA, RD, MD, and mGSV remained instructive. In conclusion, ultrahigh-field multiparameter MRI can reflect the pathological changes associated with and the underlying mechanisms of demyelination and remyelination in MS after the successful establishment of an acute CPZ-induced model. © 2021, The Author(s).</p>"
76,2-s2.0-85106763167,Whole brain 3D MR fingerprinting in multiple sclerosis: a pilot study,"<p>Background: MR fingerprinting (MRF) is a novel imaging method proposed for the diagnosis of Multiple Sclerosis (MS). This study aims to determine if MR Fingerprinting (MRF) relaxometry can differentiate frontal normal appearing white matter (F-NAWM) and splenium in patients diagnosed with MS as compared to controls and to characterize the relaxometry of demyelinating plaques relative to the time of diagnosis. Methods: Three-dimensional (3D) MRF data were acquired on a 3.0T MRI system resulting in isotropic voxels (1 × 1 × 1 mm<sup>3</sup>) and a total acquisition time of 4 min 38 s. Data were collected on 18 subjects paired with 18 controls. Regions of interest were drawn over MRF-derived T<sub>1</sub> relaxometry maps encompassing selected MS lesions, F-NAWM and splenium. T<sub>1</sub> and T<sub>2</sub> relaxometry features from those segmented areas were used to classify MS lesions from F-NAWM and splenium with T-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding algorithms. Partial least squares discriminant analysis was performed to discriminate NAWM and Splenium in MS compared with controls. Results: Mean out-of-fold machine learning prediction accuracy for discriminant results between MS patients and controls for F-NAWM was 65 % (p = 0.21) and approached 90 % (p &lt; 0.01) for the splenium. There was significant positive correlation between time since diagnosis and MS lesions mean T2 (p = 0.015), minimum T1 (p = 0.03) and negative correlation with splenium uniformity (p = 0.04). Perfect discrimination (AUC = 1) was achieved between selected features from MS lesions and F-NAWM. Conclusions: 3D-MRF has the ability to differentiate between MS and controls based on relaxometry properties from the F-NAWM and splenium. Whole brain coverage allows the assessment of quantitative properties within lesions that provide chronological assessment of the time from MS diagnosis. © 2021, The Author(s).</p>"
77,2-s2.0-85104111765,Dynamic analysis of CSF1R-related leukoencephalopathy on magnetic resonance imaging: a case report,"<p>Background: Colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R)-related leukoencephalopathy is a rare and rapidly progressive leukoencephalopathy characterized by cognitive, motor, and neuropsychiatric symptoms, which is often misdiagnosed. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) signs and follow-up MRI of CSF1R-related leukoencephalopathy could help in establishing a diagnosis, but these features are not widely known by general neurologists. Case presentation: A 34-year-old man was admitted for progressive weakness of the right limbs over 8 months. His father and sister had a similar clinical evolution. The primary neurological signs were hemiplegia, cognitive decline, dysarthria, pyramidal signs, ataxia and parkinsonism, and rapid disease progression. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis results were normal. Despite receiving treatment for improving cerebral metabolism and relieving the muscle spasm, his symptoms did not improve significantly. Brain MRI showed lesions concentrated in the corpus callosum and the deep white matter of the bilateral parieto-occipital lobes, periventricular areas, and corticospinal tracts. There was an enhanced lesion after a gadolinium-enhanced MRI scan. Over the 8-month progression, the lesions always exhibited restricted diffusion. The diffuse lesions gradually increased as the disease progressed. Genetic sequencing results showed a novel heterozygous missense mutation (c.2267 T &gt; C p.L756P) in the CSF1R gene. The patient was treated with citicoline and idebenone for 4 days to improve cerebral metabolism, but his symptoms did not improve significantly. Conclusion: The multiple lesions involving the pyramidal tract and white matter showed continuously restricted diffusion on brain imaging and gradually increased with disease progression. © 2021, The Author(s).</p>"
78,2-s2.0-85103430937,Microstructural White Matter Alterations in Cognitively Impaired Patients at Early Stages of Multiple Sclerosis,"<p>Purpose: As conventional quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) parameters are weakly associated with cognitive impairment (CI) in early multiple sclerosis (MS), we explored microstructural white matter alterations in early MS or clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) comparing patients with or without CI. Methods: Based on a preceding tract-based spatial statistics analysis (3 Tesla MRI) which contrasted 106 patients with early MS or CIS and 49 healthy controls, diffusion metrics (fractional anisotropy, FA, mean diffusivity, MD) were extracted from significant clusters using an atlas-based approach. The FA and MD were compared between patients with (Ci_P n = 14) and without (Cp_P n = 81) cognitive impairment in a subset of patients who underwent CI screening. Results: The FA was reduced in Ci_P compared to Cp_P in the splenium of corpus callosum (p = 0.001), right parahippocampal cingulum (p = 0.002) and fornix cres./stria terminalis (0.042), left posterior corona radiata (p = 0.012), bilateral cerebral peduncles, medial lemniscus and in cerebellar tracts. Increased MD was detected in the splenium of corpus callosum (p = 0.01). The CI-related localizations overlapped only partially with MS lesions. Conclusion: Microstructural white matter alterations at disease onset were detectable in Ci_P compared to Cp_P in known cognitively relevant fiber tracts, indicating the relevance of early treatment initiation in MS and CIS. © 2021, The Author(s).</p>"

We describe a case of a young man who was diagnosed with radiologically isolated syndrome (RIS) after presenting initially with symptoms suggestive of central nervous system (CNS) insult in the form of double vision, slurred speech, left-sided numbness, and unsteadiness. However, on the next day of admission, his neurological examination was remarkable for ataxia, areflexia, and ophthalmoplegia, the typical triad of Miller Fisher syndrome (MFS). After confirming both diagnoses, the final diagnosis of CCPD was made. The challenges one may face to diagnose and treat CCPD urge sharing of similar cases to open the door for further extensive and thorough investigations and to encourage further studies and analysis of available data to come up with consolidated management guidelines for rare disorders.

However, its neuroanatomical correlates still need to be fully explored. We investigated the contribution of structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) abnormalities in explaining cognitive impairment in MS. Methods: Brain dual-echo, diffusion tensor, 3D T1-weighted and resting-state (RS) MRI sequences were acquired from 276 MS patients and 102 healthy controls. Using random forest analysis, the contribution of regional white matter (WM) lesions, WM fractional anisotropy (FA) abnormalities, gray matter (GM) atrophy and RS functional connectivity (FC) alterations to cognitive impairment in MS patients was investigated. Results: Eighty-four MS patients (30.4%) were cognitively impaired. The best MRI predictors of cognitive impairment (relative importance [%]) (out-of-bag area under the curve [AUC] = 0.795) were (a) WM lesions in the right superior longitudinal fasciculus (100%), left anterior thalamic radiation (93.4%), left posterior corona radiata (78.5%), left medial lemniscus (74.2%), left inferior longitudinal fasciculus (70.4%), left optic radiation (68.7%), right middle cerebellar peduncle (60.6%) and right optic radiation (53.5%); (b) decreased FA in the splenium of the corpus callosum (64.3%), left optic radiation (61.0%), body of the corpus callosum (51.9%) and fornix (50.9%); and (c) atrophy of the left precuneus (91.4%), right cerebellum crus I (84.4%), right caudate nucleus (78.6%), left thalamus (76.2%) and left supplementary motor area (59.8%). The relevance of these MRI measures in explaining cognitive impairment was confirmed in a cross-validation analysis (AUC =0.765). Conclusion: Structural damage in strategic WM and GM regions explains cognitive impairment in MS patients more than RS FC abnormalities. © 2021 European Academy of Neurology</p>"
82,2-s2.0-85117067812,mtor signaling regulates metabolic function in oligodendrocyte precursor cells and promotes efficient brain remyelination in the cuprizone model,"<p>In demyelinating diseases, such as multiple sclerosis, primary loss of myelin and subsequent neuronal degeneration throughout the CNS impair patient functionality. While the importance of mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling during developmental myelination is known, no studies have yet directly examined the function of mTOR signaling specifically in the oligodendrocyte (OL) lineage during remyelination. Here, we conditionally deleted Mtor from adult oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) using Ng2-CreERT in male adult mice to test its function in new OLs responsible for remyelination. During early remyelination after cuprizone-induced demyelination, mice lacking mTOR in adult OPCs had unchanged OL numbers but thinner myelin. Myelin thickness recovered by late-stage repair, suggesting a delay in myelin production when Mtor is deleted from adult OPCs. Surprisingly, loss of mTOR in OPCs had no effect on efficiency of remyelination after lysophosphatidylcholine lesions in either the spinal cord or corpus callosum, suggesting that mTOR signaling functions specifically in a pathway dysregulated by cuprizone to promote remyelination efficiency. We further determined that cuprizone and inhibition of mTOR cooperatively compromise metabolic function in primary rat OLs undergoing differentiation. Together, our results support the conclusion that mTOR signaling in OPCs is required to overcome the metabolic dysfunction in the cuprizone-demyelinated adult brain. © 2021 the authors.</p>"

The aim of this article was to investigate local brain atrophy in the peri-pregnancy period (PPP) in patients with MS. Thalamic volume (TV); corpus callosum volume (CCV) and classical MRI activity (new gadolinium enhancing lesions (Gd+), new T2 lesions, T1 lesions volume (T1LV) and T2 lesions volume (T2LV)) were analyzed in 12 clinically stable women with relapsing–remitting MS and with MRI performed in the PPP. We showed that there was a significant decrease in TV (p = 0.021) in the PPP. We also observed a significant increase in the T1 lesion volume (p = 0.028), new gadoliniumenhanced and new T2 lesions (in 46% and 77% of the scans, respectively) in the post-partum period. Our results suggest that the PPP in MS may be associated not only with classical MRI activity but, also, with regional brain atrophy. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.</p>"
84,2-s2.0-85112754047,Protective Features of Calorie Restriction on Cuprizone-induced Demyelination via Modulating Microglial Phenotype,"<p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an immune-mediated demyelinating disorder in the central nervous system (CNS) with no definitive treatment, but it can be alleviated by changing life habits. Calorie restriction (CR) is effective in preventing or treating metabolic and autoimmune disorders. CR is one of the helpful approaches to control the progression of MS. In the present study, we investigated the preventive effect of caloric restriction on cuprizone induced-demyelination, a model of multiple sclerosis. To induce acute demyelination in C57/BL6 mice, we added 0.2% Cuprizone (CPZ) to their diet for 6 weeks. To induce calorie restriction, 10% Carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) was added to the diet as a dietary cellulose fiber for 6 weeks. Remyelination was studied by luxol fast blue (LFB) staining. Microglia activity, M1 and M2 microglial/macrophage phenotypes were assessed by immunohistochemistry of Iba-1, iNOS and Arg‐1, respectively. The expression of targeted genes was assessed by the real‐time polymerase chain reaction. Luxol fast blue (LFB) staining showed that the CR regimen could decrease the cuprizone-induced demyelination process (p &lt; 0.01). Moreover, the CR application could improve balance and motor performance in cuprizone-intoxicated mice by significantly enhancing protein and gene expression of Sirt1, M2 microglial phenotype marker (Arg-1) and Akt1 gene expression, also decreased M1 microglial phenotype marker (iNOS), Akt2 and P53 gene expressions (p &lt; 0.05). Cumulatively, it can be concluded that caloric restriction was able to counteract MS symptoms through alleviating inflammatory responses. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.</p>"
85,2-s2.0-85111894279,Analysis of platelet-derived growth factor receptor A and oligodendrocyte transcription factor 2 markers following Hydroxychloroquine administration in animal induced multiple sclerosis model,"<p>It has been shown that following demyelination, Oligodendrocyte Progenitor Cells (OPCs) migrate to the lesion site and begin to proliferate, and differentiate. This study aimed to investigate the effects of Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) on the expression of OLIG-2 and PDGFR-α markers during the myelination process. C57BL/6 mice were fed cuprizone pellets for 5 weeks to induce demyelination and return to a normal diet for 1 week to stimulate remyelination. During the Phase I all of the animals except CPZ and Vehicle groups were exposed to HCQ (2.5, 10, and 100 mg/kg) via drinking water. At the end of the study, animals were euthanized, perfused and the brain samples were assessed for myelination and immunohistochemistry evaluation. What is remarkable is the high rate of Olig2 + cells in the groups treated with 10 and 100 mg/kg HCQ in the demyelination phase and its decreasing trend in the remyelination phase. However, there was no significant difference between groups during phase I and Phase II based on the percentage of olig-2+/total cells in the corpus callosum region. The number of PDGFR-α+ cells in the group treated with 10 mg/kg HCQ was significant in the first phase (p value &lt; 0.05). Considering that the 100 mg/kg HCQ group had the highest level of PDGFR-α as well as the highest level of myelin repair in LFB staining, it could be inferred that it was the most effective dose in inducing proliferation and migration of OPCs. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.</p>"

It is closely related to the immune system. The effects of inflammation and immune reactions have been observed in the pathogenesis of some neurological disorders. Defined as the gene expression regulators, miRNAs participate in cellular processes. miR-146a is a mediator in the neuroimmune system, leaving substantial effects on the homeostasis of immune and brain cells, neuronal identities acquisition, and immune responses regulation in the nervous system. Its positive efficiency has been proven in modulating inflammatory reactions, hemorrhagic complications, and pain. Moreover, the miR-146a targets play a key role in the pathogenesis of these illnesses. Based on the performance of its targets, miR-146a can have various effects on the disease progress. The abnormal expression/function of miR-146a has been reported in neuroinflammatory disorders. There is research evidence that this molecule qualifies as a desirable biomarker for some disorders and can even be a therapeutic target. This study aims to provide a meticulous review regarding the roles of miR-146a in the pathogenesis and progression of several neuroinflammatory disorders such as multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, temporal lobe epilepsy, ischemic stroke, etc. The study also considers its eligibility for use as an ideal biomarker and therapeutic target in these diseases. The awareness of these mechanisms can facilitate the disease management/treatment, lead to patients’ amelioration, improve the quality of life, and mitigate the risk of death. © 2021</p>"
87,2-s2.0-85087028526,Mesenchymal Stem Cells Ameliorate Cuprizone-Induced Demyelination by Targeting Oxidative Stress and Mitochondrial Dysfunction,"<p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system. The main causes of MS disease progression, demyelination, and tissue damage are oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. Hence, the latter are considered as important therapeutic targets. Recent studies have demonstrated that mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) possess antioxidative properties and are able to target mitochondrial dysfunction. Therefore, we investigated the effect of transplanting Wharton’s jelly-derived MSCs in a demyelination mouse model of MS in which mice were fed cuprizone (CPZ) for 12 weeks. CPZ is a copper chelator that impairs the activity of cytochrome oxidase, decreases oxidative phosphorylation, and produces degenerative changes in oligodendrocytes, leading to toxic demyelination similar to those found in MS patients. Results showed that MSCs caused a significant increase in the percentage of myelinated areas and in the number of myelinated fibers in the corpus callosum of the CPZ + MSC group, compared to the CPZ group, as assessed by Luxol fast blue staining and transmission electron microscopy. In addition, transplantation of MSCs significantly increased the number of oligodendrocytes while decreasing astrogliosis and microgliosis in the corpus callosum of the CPZ + MSC group, evaluated by immunofluorescence. Moreover, the mechanism by which MSCs exert these physiological effects was found to be through abolishing the effect of CPZ on oxidative stress markers and mitochondrial dysfunction. Indeed, malondialdehyde significantly decreased while glutathione and superoxide dismutase significantly increased in CPZ + MSC mice group, in comparison witth the CPZ group alone. Furthermore, cell therapy with MSC transplantation increased the expression levels of mitochondrial biogenesis transcripts PGC1α, NRF1, MFN2, and TFAM. In summary, these results demonstrate that MSCs may attenuate MS by promoting an antioxidant response, reducing oxidative stress, and improving mitochondrial homeostasis. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.</p>"
88,2-s2.0-85115638048,MRI Patterns Distinguish AQP4 Antibody Positive Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorder From Multiple Sclerosis,"<p>Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) and multiple sclerosis (MS) are inflammatory diseases of the CNS. Overlap in the clinical and MRI features of NMOSD and MS means that distinguishing these conditions can be difficult. With the aim of evaluating the diagnostic utility of MRI features in distinguishing NMOSD from MS, we have conducted a cross-sectional analysis of imaging data and developed predictive models to distinguish the two conditions. NMOSD and MS MRI lesions were identified and defined through a literature search. Aquaporin-4 (AQP4) antibody positive NMOSD cases and age- and sex-matched MS cases were collected. MRI of orbits, brain and spine were reported by at least two blinded reviewers. MRI brain or spine was available for 166/168 (99%) of cases. Longitudinally extensive (OR = 203), “bright spotty” (OR = 93.8), whole (axial; OR = 57.8) or gadolinium (Gd) enhancing (OR = 28.6) spinal cord lesions, bilateral (OR = 31.3) or Gd-enhancing (OR = 15.4) optic nerve lesions, and nucleus tractus solitarius (OR = 19.2), periaqueductal (OR = 16.8) or hypothalamic (OR = 7.2) brain lesions were associated with NMOSD. Ovoid (OR = 0.029), Dawson's fingers (OR = 0.031), pyramidal corpus callosum (OR = 0.058), periventricular (OR = 0.136), temporal lobe (OR = 0.137) and T1 black holes (OR = 0.154) brain lesions were associated with MS. A score-based algorithm and a decision tree determined by machine learning accurately predicted more than 85% of both diagnoses using first available imaging alone. We have confirmed NMOSD and MS specific MRI features and combined these in predictive models that can accurately identify more than 85% of cases as either AQP4 seropositive NMOSD or MS. © Copyright © 2021 Clarke, Arnett, Bukhari, Khalilidehkordi, Jimenez Sanchez, O'Gorman, Sun, Prain, Woodhall, Silvestrini, Bundell, Abernethy, Bhuta, Blum, Boggild, Boundy, Brew, Brownlee, Butzkueven, Carroll, Chen, Coulthard, Dale, Das, Fabis-Pedrini, Gillis, Hawke, Heard, Henderson, Heshmat, Hodgkinson, Kilpatrick, King, Kneebone, Kornberg, Lechner-Scott, Lin, Lynch, Macdonell, Mason, McCombe, Pereira, Pollard, Ramanathan, Reddel, Shaw, Spies, Stankovich, Sutton, Vucic, Walsh, Wong, Yiu, Barnett, Kermode, Marriott, Parratt, Slee, Taylor, Willoughby, Brilot, Vincent, Waters and Broadley.</p>"

The objective of our study was to characterize the neuroimaging features and associated factors in Multiple sclerosis patients in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Method: A cross-sectional observational study was conducted in 30 multiple sclerosis patients at Yehuleshet Specialty Clinic, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Both descriptive and analytical statistics were used to analyze the data. Results: We have enrolled 30 patients with confirmed multiple sclerosis and clinically isolate syndrome. The mean age was 34.7 years (1SD=8.9). Female accounted 86.7%. The mean duration of illness was 3.4 years (1SD=3.1) (range: 1 - 11 years). Relapsing and remitting variant was the commonest sub type (66.7%). Alcohol use and head injury were the commonest identified risk factors reported by the patients. Classical radiological features of MS such as white matter lesions involving juxtacortical, U-fiber, corpus callosum (CC), and Dawson's finger projections pattern were observed in 46.7%, 23.3%, 70%, and 40% respectively. Cervical and thoracic cords were affected in 40% and 6.7% respectively. Global cortical and CC atrophy was observed in 16.7% and 6.7% respectively. Advanced age was associated with lesions of corpus callosum when adjusted for duration of illness and history of head injury (AOR 1.13, 95% CI 1.01-1.28, p=0.04). Conclusion: Typical neuroimaging features of MS were prevalent among Ethiopian MS patients. Age was an independent predictor of lesions involving corpus callosum.

90,2-s2.0-85111664590,The Role of Hippo Signaling Pathway in the Development of the Nervous System,"<p>Hippo signaling pathway is a highly conserved and crucial signaling pathway that controls the size of tissues and organs by regulating the proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis of cells. The nervous system is a complicated system that participates in information collection, integration, and procession. The balance of various aspects of the nervous system is vital for the normal regulation of physiological conditions of the body, like the population and distribution of nerve cells, nerve connections, and so on. Defects in these aspects may lead to cognitive, behavioral, and neurological dysfunction, resulting in various nervous system diseases. Recently, accumulating evidence proposes that Hippo pathway maintains numerous biological functions in the nervous system development, including modulating the proliferation and differentiation of nerve cells and promoting the development of synapse, corpus callosum, and cortex. In this review, we will summarize recent findings of Hippo pathway in the nervous system to improve our understanding on its function and to provide potential therapeutic strategies of nervous system diseases in the future. © 2021 S.

91,2-s2.0-85108548379,The remyelination effect of DNA framework nucleic acids on demyelinating diseases,"<p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is one of the most famous and common demyelinating diseases in young adults, characterized by motor, sensory, and cognitive impairments. In MS patients, multifocal demyelinating lesions, inflammatory infiltrates, axonal damage, and deletion of oligodendrocytes are observed. For the solely immunomodulatory focus has exhibited unsatisfactory ability to combat the progression of MS disability. There is an absence of first-line drugs against MS to delay the progression and obtain clinical improvement. Tetrahedral framework nucleic acids (tFNAs), novel self-assembled nucleic-acid nanomaterials, have been found to exhibit broad application value. Previous studies have reported positive reactions between tFNAs and various cell types, and tFNAs are able to act the advantages of neuroprotective, anti-apoptosis and anti-inflammatory. To investigate a new research direction for remyelination and potential mechanism for MS therapies, we attempted to characterize the effects of tFNAs on remyelination. The results in vitro demonstrated that tFNAs were able to rescue oligodendroglial progenitor cells (OPCs) from interferon-γ (IFN-γ) induced cell death. In in vivo study, functional remyelination was assessed by behavior test and histological examination in cuprizone-induced mice treated with tFNAs. The tFNAs-treated groups exhibited excellent remyelination. Proteins related to the PI3K-AKT-mTOR and mitochondrial apoptotic pathways were examined to further support this finding. In conclusion, our study suggested the therapeutic potential of tFNAs for MS patients by enhancing the remyelination. © 2021</p>"

We investigated the role of the oligodendrocyte/myelin protein ermin in de- and remyelination in the cuprizone (CPZ) mouse model, and in MS. The density of ermin+ oligodendrocytes in the brain was significantly decreased after one week of CPZ exposure (p &lt; 0.02). The relative proportion of ermin+ cells compared to cells positive for the late-stage oligodendrocyte marker Nogo-A increased at the onset of remyelination in the corpus callosum (p &lt; 0.02). The density of ermin-positive cells increased in the corpus callosum during the CPZ-phase of extensive remyelination (p &lt; 0.0001). In MS, the density of ermin+ cells was higher in remyelinated lesion areas compared to non-remyelinated areas both in white- (p &lt; 0.0001) and grey matter (p &lt; 0.0001) and compared to normal-appearing white matter (p &lt; 0.001). Ermin immunopositive cells in MS-lesions were not immunopositive for the early-stage oligodendrocyte markers O4 and O1, but a subpopulation was immunopositive for Nogo-A. The data suggest a relatively higher proportion of ermin immunopositivity in oligodendrocytes compared to Nogo-A indicates recent or ongoing remyelination. © 2021 Ahmad et al.

In this review we focus on the brain involvement in DM2, including its pathogenic mechanisms, microstructural, macrostructural and functional brain changes, as well as the effects of all these impairments on patients’ everyday life. We also try to understand how brain abnormalities in DM2 should be adequately measured and potentially treated. The most important pathogenetic mechanisms in DM2 are RNA gain-of-function and repeat-associated non-ATG (RAN) translation. One of the main neuroimaging findings in DM2 is the presence of diffuse periventricular white matter hyperintensity lesions (WMHLs). Brain atrophy has been described in DM2 patients, but it is not clear if it is mostly caused by a decrease of the white or gray matter volume. The most commonly reported specific cognitive symptoms in DM2 are dysexecutive syndrome, visuospatial and memory impairments. Fatigue, sleep-related disorders and pain are also frequent in DM2. The majority of key symptoms and signs in DM2 has a great influence on patients’ daily lives, their psychological status, economic situation and quality of life. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.</p>"

The model of demyelination was carried out by the administration of cuprizone to the drinking water of the experimental mice. Besides cuprizone, 4-AP derivatives and 4-AP were administered to the groups in order to assess their protective effect on the demyelination. We used immunohistochemistry for visualization of changes in corpus callosum. Memory storage processes were also assessed with the passive avoidance test on the last two days of the experiment. The experimental mice treated with compounds 4b and 4c increased significantly their latency time on the second day in comparison to the control group which indicated an improved memory process. The number of mature oligodendrocytes in the groups treated with compounds 4b, 4c and 4-AP is closer to those in the control group. The results of our studies showed that the newly synthesized compounds 4b and 4c reverse the effect of cuprizone.

96,2-s2.0-85108788299,Structural impairments in hippocampal and occipitotemporal networks specifically contribute to decline in place and face category processing but not to other visual object categories in healthy aging,"<p>Background: Functional neuroimaging studies have identified a set of nodes in the occipital–temporal cortex that preferentially respond to faces in comparison with other visual objects. By contrast, the processing of places seems to rely on parahippocampal cortex and structures heavily implicated in memory (e.g., the hippocampus). It has been suggested that human aging leads to decreased neural specialization of core face and place processing areas and impairments in face and place perception. Methods: Using mediation analysis, we tested the potential contribution of micro- and macrostructure within the hippocampal and occipitotemporal systems to age-associated effects in face and place category processing (as measured by 1-back working memory tasks) in 55 healthy adults (age range 23–79 years). To test for specific contributions of the studied structures to face/place processing, we also studied a distinct tract (i.e., the anterior thalamic radiation [ATR]) and cognitive performance for other visual object categories (objects, bodies, and verbal material). Constrained spherical deconvolution-based tractography was used to reconstruct the fornix, the inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF), and the ATR. Hippocampal volumetric measures were segmented from FSL-FIRST toolbox. Results: It was found that age associates with (a) decreases in fractional anisotropy (FA) in the fornix, in right ILF (but not left ILF), and in the ATR (b) reduced volume in the right and left hippocampus and (c) decline in visual object category processing. Importantly, mediation analysis showed that micro- and macrostructural impairments in the fornix and right hippocampus, respectively, associated with age-dependent decline in place processing. Alternatively, microstructural impairments in right hemispheric ILF associated with age-dependent decline in face processing. There were no other mediator effects of micro- and macrostructural variables on age–cognition relationships. Conclusion: Together, the findings support specific contributions of the fornix and right hippocampus in visuospatial scene processing and of the long-range right hemispheric occipitotemporal network in face category processing. © 2021 The Authors.

This disease is extremely rare in children. We present the clinical data, radiological appearance, and development of lesions in eight children. Methods: We analyzed the clinical information of eight patients diagnosed between 2012 and 2020. Magnetic resonance brain and spinal cord examinations with contrast medium administration were performed using a 1.5-T scanner. Results: All patients presented at least one typical Baló lesion on brain imaging. Four patients additionally had typical multiple sclerosis plaques. All primary Baló lesions had a characteristic appearance of concentric hyperintense rings on T2-weighted imaging and were round or ovoid. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis was performed in all patients. Oligoclonal bands were present in seven patients, and four of them had multiple sclerosis plaques on baseline brain magnetic resonance imaging. Conclusion: Baló concentric sclerosis in children was characterized by acute and severe onset with hemiparesis as a predominant symptom. The size, contrast enhancement, and restricted diffusion changed depending on the phase of the disease. © 2021</p>"
98,2-s2.0-85107758332,Clinical practice patterns in multiple sclerosis management: Mexican consensus recommendations,"<p>Background: Multiple sclerosis affects more than 2 million people. Clinical decisions are performed under evidence-based medicine. The appearance of new disease-modifying therapies and changes in diagnostic criteria complicates the decision-making process in clinical practice. Objectives: To characterize the criteria for radiologically isolated syndrome (RIS), clinically isolated syndrome (CIS), and relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) by Mexican neurologists in a real-world setting. Methods: A two-round modified Delphi method (RAND/UCLA) was applied. Results: In RIS, LP, spinal cord MRI and VEP should be included in diagnostic testing; DMT initiation is not necessary. A follow-up MRI within 3 months are recommended. In CIS, corticosteroid therapy should be initiated at first relapse; both simple and Gd-enhanced MRI is mandatory. LP, selective blood tests, and NMO-IgG/AQP4 antibodies should be performed as complementary. IFN beta or GA were the most suitable DMTs for treating high-risk CIS. Patients with RRMS should begin with DMT at diagnosis, include a follow-up MRI if a patient had 2 relapses within 6 months. GA and oral DMTs are the most eligible DMTs for mild RRMS. Monoclonal antibodies-based therapy is chosen when disability is present. Radiological criteria for switching DMT included &gt;1 Gd+ lesion and &gt;2 new T2 lesions. Conclusions: Although many coincidences, there are still many hollows in the medical attention of MS in Mexico. This consensus recommendation could be helpful to implement better evidence-based recommendations and guidelines in a real-world setting. © 2021</p>"
99,2-s2.0-85105605177,ADAM10 suppresses demyelination and reduces seizure susceptibility in cuprizone-induced demyelination model,"<p>The metalloproteinase ADAM10 is the most important amyloid precursor protein (APP) α-secretase, preventing the deposit of neurotoxic amyloid β (Aβ) peptide and generating a soluble APP fragment (sAPP<sub>α</sub>) with neurotrophic functions. Recent studies have suggested that ADAM10 also play a role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory CNS diseases, such as multiple sclerosis (MS). Demyelination is the hallmarks of MS but the mechanisms involved remain unclear. Here in this study, we examined the role that ADAM10 might play in the cuprizone-induced demyelination model. Our results demonstrated that ADAM10 expression and sAPP<sub>α</sub> production were significantly reduced in the corpus callosum in response to cuprizone treatment. Overexpression of ADAM10 increased sAPP<sub>α</sub> production and suppressed demyelination as well as neuroinflammation and oxidative stress in cuprizone-induced demyelination model. Pharmacological inhibition of ADAM10 activity, however, abrogates the protective effect of ADAM10 against demyelination, neuroinflammation and oxidative stress. It has been reported that CNS demyelination may induce seizure activity. Here, we found that overexpression of ADAM10 reduced seizure susceptibility in cuprizone-induced demyelination model, suggesting that ADAM10-derived sAPP<sub>α</sub> suppresses demyelination and reduces seizure susceptibility via ameliorating neuroinflammation and oxidative stress in cuprizone-induced demyelination model. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.</p>"
100,2-s2.0-85103647880,Delayed access to conscious processing in multiple sclerosis: Reduced cortical activation and impaired structural connectivity,"<p>Although multiple sclerosis (MS) is frequently accompanied by visuo-cognitive impairment, especially functional brain mechanisms underlying this impairment are still not well understood. Consequently, we used a functional MRI (fMRI) backward masking task to study visual information processing stratifying unconscious and conscious in MS. Specifically, 30 persons with MS (pwMS) and 34 healthy controls (HC) were shown target stimuli followed by a mask presented 8–150 ms later and had to compare the target to a reference stimulus. Retinal integrity (via optical coherence tomography), optic tract integrity (visual evoked potential; VEP) and whole brain structural connectivity (probabilistic tractography) were assessed as complementary structural brain integrity markers. On a psychophysical level, pwMS reached conscious access later than HC (50 vs. 16 ms, p &lt;.001). The delay increased with disease duration (p &lt;.001, β =.37) and disability (p &lt;.001, β =.24), but did not correlate with conscious information processing speed (Symbol digit modality test, β =.07, p =.817). No association was found for VEP and retinal integrity markers. Moreover, pwMS were characterized by decreased brain activation during unconscious processing compared with HC. No group differences were found during conscious processing. Finally, a complementary structural brain integrity analysis showed that a reduced fractional anisotropy in corpus callosum and an impaired connection between right insula and primary visual areas was related to delayed conscious access in pwMS. Our study revealed slowed conscious access to visual stimulus material in MS and a complex pattern of functional and structural alterations coupled to unconscious processing of/delayed conscious access to visual stimulus material in MS. © 2021 The Authors.

Atypical clinical presentation and heterogeneity of neuroimaging findings that have been initially confused with metabolic disorders have hampered early diagnosis. To describe a series of patients with subacute sclerosing panencephalitis with imaging findings mimicking metabolic disorders. A total of six patients with subacute sclerosing panencephalitis were diagnosed from January 2012 to December 2016 in whom a metabolic disorder was suspected on initial clinical and MRI findings. Detailed laboratory investigation was performed in all patients. All patients presented with atypical neurologic manifestations, including dystonia, syncopal attacks, involuntary limb movements, meaningless speech and ataxia. Magnetic resonance imaging abnormalities included bilateral putaminal, bilateral posterior periventricular white matter and diffuse or splenial corpus callosum involvement which are particularly unusual in SSPE and mostly observed in metabolic disorders. All patients had elevated cerebrospinal fluid Ig G measles antibodies. The diagnosis of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis through clinical and imaging features can be considerably challenging. It is crucial to differentiate it from metabolic disorders, since the management and clinical outcome are different. © 2020, Belgian Neurological Society.</p>"
102,2-s2.0-85103752706,Remyelination is enhanced by Astragalus polysaccharides through inducing the differentiation of oligodendrocytes from neural stem cells in cuprizone model of demyelination,"<p>Demyelination is the hallmark of multiple sclerosis (MS). Promoting remyelination is an important strategy to treat MS. Our previous study showed that Astragalus polysaccharides (APS), the main bioactive component of Astragalus membranaceus, could prevent demyelination in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis mice. To investigate the effects of APS on remyelination and the underlying mechanisms, in this study we set up a cuprizone-induced demyelination model in mice and treated them with APS. It was found that APS relieved the neurobehavioral dysfunctions caused by demyelination, and efficaciously facilitated remyelination in vivo. In order to determine whether the mechanism of enhancing remyelination was associated with the differentiation of neural stem cells (NSCs), biomarkers of NSCs, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes and neurons were measured in the corpus callosum tissues of mice through Real-time PCR, Western blot and immunohistochemistry assays. Data revealed that APS suppressed the stemness of NSCs, reduced the differentiation of NSCs into astrocytes, and promoted the differentiation into oligodendrocytes and neurons. This phenomenon was confirmed in the differentiation model of C17.2 NSCs cultured in vitro. Since Sonic hedgehog signaling pathway has been proven to be crucial to the differentiation of NSCs into oligodendrocytes, we examined expression levels of the key molecules in this pathway in vivo and in vitro, and eventually found APS activated this signaling pathway. Together, our results demonstrated that APS probably activated Sonic hedgehog signaling pathway first, then induced NSCs to differentiate into oligodendrocytes and promoted remyelination, which suggested that APS might be a potential candidate in treating MS. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.</p>"
103,2-s2.0-85111604209,Sodium Intensity Changes Differ Between Relaxation- and Density-Weighted MRI in Multiple Sclerosis,"<p>Introduction: The source of Tissue Sodium Concentration (TSC) increase in Multiple Sclerosis (MS) remains unclear, and could be attributed to altered intracellular sodium concentration or tissue microstructure. This paper investigates sodium in MS using three new MRI sequences. Methods: Three sodium scans were acquired at 4.7 T from 30 patients (11 relapsing-remitting, 10 secondary-progressive, 9 primary-progressive) and 9 healthy controls including: Density-Weighted (NaDW), with very short 30° excitation for more accurate TSC measurement; Projection Acquisition with Coherent MAgNetization (NaPACMAN), designed for enhanced relaxation-based contrast; and Soft Inversion Recovery FLuid Attenuation (NaSIRFLA), developed to reduce fluid space contribution. Signal was measured in both lesions (n = 397) and normal appearing white matter (NAWM) relative to controls in the splenium of corpus callosum and the anterior and posterior limbs of internal capsule. Correlations with clinical and cognitive evaluations were tested over all MS patients. Results: Sodium intensity in MS lesions was elevated over control WM by a greater amount for NaPACMAN (75%) than NaDW (35%), the latter representing TSC. In contrast, NaSIRFLA exhibited lower intensity, but only for region specific analysis in the SCC (−7%). Sodium intensity in average MS NAWM was not significantly different than control WM for either of the three scans. NaSIRFLA in the average NAWM and specifically the posterior limb of internal capsules positively correlated with the Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT). Discussion: Lower NaSIRFLA signal in lesions and ~2× greater NaPACMAN signal elevation over control WM than NaDW can be explained with a demyelination model that also includes edema. A NAWM demyelination model that includes tissue atrophy suggests no signal change for NaSIRFLA, and only slightly greater NAWM signal than control WM for both NaDW and NaPACMAN, reflecting experimental results. Models were derived from previous total and myelin water fraction study in MS with T2-relaxometry, and for the first time include sodium within the myelin water space. Reduced auditory processing association with lower signal on NaSIRFLA cannot be explained by greater demyelination and its modeled impact on the three sodium MRI sequences. Alternative explanations include intra- or extracellular sodium concentration change. Relaxation-weighted sodium MRI in combination with sodium-density MRI may help elucidate microstructural and metabolic changes in MS. © Copyright © 2021 Stobbe, Boyd, Smyth, Emery, Valdés Cabrera and Beaulieu.</p>"
104,2-s2.0-85109262386,Anti-LINGO -1 improved remyelination and neurobehavioral deficit in cuprizone-induced demyelination,"<p>Objective(s): Central nervous system demyelination is the main feature of multiple sclerosis (MS). The most important unmet need in MS is use of treatments that delay the progression of the disease. Leucine-rich repeat and Immunoglobulin-like domain containing NOGO receptor-interacting protein 1(LINGO-1) have been known as inhibitors of oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelination. Materials and Methods: We investigated LINGO-1 antibody effects on remyelination and neurobehavioral deficit using cuprizone-induced demyelination. Animals were randomly divided into three groups (n = 10): (1) Control group; received the regular diet, (2) CPZ group; normal saline was injected intraperitoneally, and (3) Treatment group; LINGO-1 antibody (10 mg/kg) was injected IP once every six days for 3 weeks. We assessed the level of myelin basic protein (MBP), neurofilament heavy chain (NF200), and Brain-derived neuroprotective factor (BDNF) in the corpus callosum (CC) by immunostaining against MBP, NF200, and BDNF. Results: We found decreased levels of MBP, NF200, and BDNF in demyelinated CC, and anti-LINGO-1 treatment improved demyelinated structures. Furthermore, motor impairment was measured by Open-field (OFT) and Balance beam tests. In the treatment group, motor impairment was significantly improved. Conclusion: These results provide evidence that LINGO-1 antibody can improve remyelination and neurobehavioral deficit. © 2021 Mashhad University of Medical Sciences. All rights reserved.</p>"

Novel therapies for MS are needed considering the efficiency and safety limitations of current treatments. In our study, we investigated the effects of venlafaxine (antidepressant, serotonin‐norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor), risperidone (atypical antipsychotic) and febuxostat (gout medication, xanthine oxidase inhibitor) in the cuprizone mouse model of acute demyelination, hypothesizing an antagonistic effect on TRPA1 calcium channels. Cuprizone and drugs were administered to C57BL6/J mice for five weeks and locomotor activity, motor performance and cold sensitivity were assessed. Mice brains were harvested for histological staining and assessment of oxidative stress markers. Febuxostat and metabolites of venlafaxine (desvenlafaxine) and risperidone (paliperidone) were tested for TRPA1 antagonistic activity. Following treatment, venlafaxine and risperidone significantly improved motor performance and sensitivity to a cold stimulus. All administered drugs ameliorated the cuprizone‐induced deficit of superoxide dismutase activity. Desvenlafaxine and paliperidone showed no activity on TRPA1, while febuxostat exhibited agonistic activity at high concentrations. Our findings indicated that all three drugs offered some protection against the effects of cuprizone‐induced demyelination. The agonistic activity of febuxostat can be of potential use for discovering novel TRPA1 ligands. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.</p>"
106,2-s2.0-85108695457,Specific Blockade of Bone Morphogenetic Protein-2/4 Induces Oligodendrogenesis and Remyelination in Demyelinating Disorders,"<p>Oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) are present in demyelinated lesions of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. However, their differentiation into functional oligodendrocytes is insufficient, and most lesions evolve into nonfunctional astroglial scars. Blockade of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling induces differentiation of OPCs into myelin-producing oligodendrocytes. We studied the effect of specific blockade of BMP-2/4 signaling, by intravenous (IV) treatment with anti-BMP-2/4 neutralizing mAb in both the inflammatory model of relapsing experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (R-EAE) and the cuprizone-toxic model of demyelination in mice. Administration of anti-BMP-2/4 to R-EAE-induced mice, on day 9 post-immunization (p.i.), ameliorated R-EAE signs, diminished the expression of phospho-SMAD1/5/8, primarily within the astrocytic lineage, increased the numbers of de novo immature and mature oligodendrocytes, and reduced the numbers of newly generated astrocytes within the spinal cord as early as day 18 p.i. This effect was accompanied with elevated remyelination, manifested by increased density of remyelinating axons (0.8 &lt; g-ratios &lt; 1), and reduced fully demyelinated and demyelinating axons, in the anti-BMP-2/4-treated R-EAE mice, studied by electron microscopy. No significant immunosuppressive effect was observed in the CNS and in the periphery, during the peak of the first attack, or at the end of the experiment. Moreover, IV treatment with anti-BMP-2/4 mAb in the cuprizone-challenged mice augmented the numbers of mature oligodendrocytes and remyelination in the corpus callosum during the recovery phase of the disease. Based on our findings, the specific blockade of BMP-2/4 has a therapeutic potential in demyelinating disorders such as MS, by inducing early oligodendrogenesis-mediated remyelination in the affected tissue. © 2021, The American Society for Experimental NeuroTherapeutics, Inc.</p>"

This study identifies predictors of CSF-OCB-positivity among in vivo metabolic markers in the subcortical gray/white matter in MS patients after their first episode (CIS) and in patients with relapsing-remitting course (RRMS). Methods: The study enrolled 13 CIS and 23 RRMS patients. Metabolism was evaluated using Mescher-Garwood-edited proton-magnetic resonance spectroscopy on a 3T MR scanner. In addition to N-acetyl-aspartate (tNAA), myoinositol (mIns), and choline- and creatine compounds (tCho, tCr) were also evaluated γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glutamate-glutamine (Glx) ratios. Results: CSF-OCB-positivity was found in 76.9% of CIS and 78.2% of RRMS patients. GABA and Glx ratios in putamen and corpus callosum strongly determined CSF-OCB-positive CIS patients. Other essential predictors of CSF-OCB-positive CIS were mIns and Glx ratios in the putamen, and tCho/tNAA in the corpus callosum. In RRMS, GABA ratios in the right thalamus and Glx ratios in the left hippocampus strongly predicted CSF-OCB-positive patients. tCho/tNAA and tNAA/tCr in the left hippocampus were also identified as essential predictors of CSF-OCB-positive RRMS patients. Conclusion: This is the first in vivo evidence of GABA-Glx rearrangement in CSF-OCB-positive patients since its early stages of MS. © 2021 The Authors</p>"
108,2-s2.0-85105102760,"Focal white matter lesions induce long-lasting axonal degeneration, neuroinflammation and behavioral deficits","<p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the central nervous system (CNS) with episodes of inflammatory demyelination and remyelination. While remyelination has been linked with functional recovery in MS patients, there is evidence of ongoing tissue damage despite complete myelin repair. In this study, we investigated the long-term consequences of an acute demyelinating white matter CNS lesion. For this purpose, acute demyelination was induced by 5-week-cuprizone intoxication in male C57BL/6 J mice, and the tissues were examined after a 7-month recovery period. While myelination and oligodendrocyte densities appeared normal, ongoing axonal degeneration and glia cell activation were found in the remyelinated corpus callosum. Neuropathologies were paralleled by subtle gait abnormalities evaluated using DigiGait™ high speed ventral plane videography. Gene array analyses revealed increased expression levels of various inflammation related genes, among protein kinase c delta (PRKCD). Immunofluorescence stains revealed predominant microglia/macrophages PRKCD expression in both, cuprizone tissues and post-mortem MS lesions. These results support the hypothesis that chronic microglia/macrophages driven tissue injury represents a key aspect of progressive neurodegeneration and functional decline in MS. © 2021 The Authors</p>"
109,2-s2.0-85109166607,IL-17 Inhibits Oligodendrocyte Progenitor Cell Proliferation and Differentiation by Increasing K<sup>+</sup> Channel Kv1.3,"<p>Interleukin 17 (IL-17) is a signature cytokine of Th17 cells. IL-17 level is significantly increased in inflammatory conditions of the CNS, including but not limited to post-stroke and multiple sclerosis. IL-17 has been detected direct toxicity on oligodendrocyte (Ol) lineage cells and inhibition on oligodendrocyte progenitor cell (OPC) differentiation, and thus promotes myelin damage. The cellular mechanism of IL-17 in CNS inflammatory diseases remains obscure. Voltage-gated K<sup>+</sup> (Kv) channel 1.3 is the predominant Kv channel in Ol and potentially involved in Ol function and cell cycle regulation. Kv1.3 of T cells involves in immunomodulation of inflammatory progression, but the role of Ol Kv1.3 in inflammation-related pathogenesis has not been fully investigated. We hypothesized that IL-17 induces myelin injury through Kv1.3 activation. To test the hypothesis, we studied the involvement of OPC/Ol Kv1.3 in IL-17-induced Ol/myelin injury in vitro and in vivo. Kv1.3 currents and channel expression gradually decreased during the OPC development. Application of IL-17 to OPC culture increased Kv1.3 expression, leading to a decrease of AKT activation, inhibition of proliferation and myelin basic protein reduction, which were prevented by a specific Kv1.3 blocker 5-(4-phenoxybutoxy) psoralen. IL-17-caused myelin injury was validated in LPC-induced demyelination mouse model, particularly in corpus callosum, which was also mitigated by aforementioned Kv1.3 antagonist. IL-17 altered Kv1.3 expression and resultant inhibitory effects on OPC proliferation and differentiation may by interrupting AKT phosphorylating activation. Taken together, our results suggested that IL-17 impairs remyelination and promotes myelin damage by Kv1.3-mediated Ol/myelin injury. Thus, blockade of Kv1.3 as a potential therapeutic strategy for inflammatory CNS disease may partially attribute to the direct protection on OPC proliferation and differentiation other than immunomodulation. © Copyright © 2021 Liu, Yang, Yang, Yuan, Wang, Zhang, Xiong and Xu.</p>"
110,2-s2.0-85108072045,Innate Signaling in the CNS Prevents Demyelination in a Focal EAE Model,"<p>The pathological hallmark of multiple sclerosis (MS) is the formation of multifocal demyelinating lesions in the central nervous system (CNS). Stimulation of innate receptors has been shown to suppress experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an MS-like disease in mice. Specifically, targeting Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) and NOD-like receptor 2 (NOD2) significantly reduced disease severity. In the present work we have developed a novel focal EAE model to further study the effect of innate signaling on demyelinating pathology. Focal lesions were induced by stereotactic needle insertion into the corpus callosum (CC) of mice previously immunized for EAE. This resulted in focal pathology characterized by infiltration and demyelination in the CC. We find that intrathecal delivery of MIS416, a TLR9 and NOD2 bispecific innate ligand, into the cerebrospinal fluid reduced focal lesions in the CC. This was associated with upregulation of type I and II interferons, interleukin-10, arginase-1, CCL-2 and CXCL-10. Analysis of draining cervical lymph nodes showed upregulation of type II interferons and interleukin 10. Moreover, intrathecal MIS416 altered the composition of early CNS infiltrates, increasing proportions of myeloid and NK cells and reducing T cells at the lesion site. This study contributes to an increased understanding of how innate immune responses can play a protective role, which in turn may lead to additional therapeutic strategies for the prevention and treatment of demyelinating pathologies. © Copyright © 2021 Dubik, Marczynska, Mørch, Webster, Jensen, Wlodarczyk, Khorooshi and Owens.</p>"
111,2-s2.0-85110333844,Retinal and brain microglia in multiple sclerosis and neurodegeneration,"<p>Microglia are the resident immune cells of the central nervous system (CNS), including the retina. Similar to brain microglia, retinal microglia are responsible for retinal surveillance, rapidly responding to changes in the environment by altering morphotype and function. Microglia become activated in inflammatory responses in neurodegenerative diseases, including multiple sclerosis (MS). When activated by stress stimuli, retinal microglia change their morphology and activity, with either beneficial or harmful consequences. In this review, we describe characteristics of CNS microglia, including those in the retina, with a focus on their morphology, activation states and function in health, ageing, MS and other neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, glaucoma and retinitis pigmentosa, to highlight their activity in disease.

112,2-s2.0-85089288966,Autofluorescence spectroscopy as a proxy for chronic white matter pathology,"<p>Background: The balance of tissue injury and repair ultimately determines outcomes of chronic neurological disorders, such as progressive multiple sclerosis (MS). However, the extent of pathology can be difficult to detect, particularly when it is insidious and/or offset by tissue regeneration. Objectives: The objective of this research is to evaluate whether tissue autofluorescence—typically a source of contamination—provides a surrogate marker of white matter injury. Methods: Tissue autofluorescence in autopsied specimens both experimental and clinical was characterized by spectral confocal microscopy and correlated to severity and chronicity as determined by standard histopathology. Results: Months after cuprizone (CPZ)-induced demyelination, despite robust remyelination, autofluorescent deposits progressively accumulated in regions of prior pathology. Autofluorescent deposits (likely reflecting myelin debris remnants) were conspicuously localized to white matter, proportional to lesion severity, and displayed differential fluorescence over time. Strikingly, similar features were apparent also in autopsied MS tissue. Conclusion: Autofluorescence spectroscopy illuminates prior and ongoing white matter injury. The accumulation of autofluorescence in proportion to the extent of progressive atrophy, despite robust remyelination in the CPZ brain, provides important proof-of-concept of a phenomenon (insidious ongoing damage masked by mechanisms of tissue repair) that we hypothesize is highly relevant to the progressive phase of MS. © The Author(s), 2020.</p>"
113,2-s2.0-85088934359,White matter correlates of slowed information processing speed in unimpaired multiple sclerosis patients with young age onset,"<p>Slowed information processing speed is among the earliest markers of cognitive impairment in multiple sclerosis (MS) and has been associated with white matter (WM) structural integrity. Localization of WM tracts associated with slowing, but not significant impairment, on specific cognitive tasks in pediatric and young age onset MS can facilitate early and effective therapeutic intervention. Diffusion tensor imaging data were collected on 25 MS patients and 24 controls who also underwent the Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) and the computer-based Cogstate simple and choice reaction time tests. Fractional anisotropy (FA), mean (MD), radial (RD) and axial (AD) diffusivities were correlated voxel-wise with processing speed measures. All DTI metrics of several white matter tracts were significantly different between groups (p &lt; 0.05). Notably, higher MD, RD, and AD, but not FA, in the corpus callosum correlated with lower scores on both SDMT and simple reaction time. Additionally, all diffusivity metrics in the left corticospinal tract correlated negatively with SDMT scores, whereas only MD in the right superior fronto-occipital fasciculus correlated with simple reaction time. In conclusion, subtle slowing of processing speed is correlated with WM damage in the visual-motor processing pathways in patients with young age of MS onset. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.</p>"

The effect of 17β-estradiol therapy on microglia polarization and neuroinflammation in the corpus callosum of the cuprizone-induced demyelination model has not been elucidated. In this study, mice were given 0.2% cuprizone (CPZ) for 5 weeks to induce demyelination during which they received 50 ng of 17β-estradiol (EST), injected subcutaneously in the neck region, twice weekly. Data revealed that treatment with 17β-estradiol therapy (CPZ+EST) improved neurological behavioral deficits, displayed by a significant reduction in escape latencies, in comparison to untreated CPZ mice. Also, administration of 17β-estradiol caused a decrease in demyelination levels and axonal injury, as demonstrated by staining with Luxol fast blue, immunofluorescence to myelin basic protein, and transmission electron microscopy analysis. In addition, at the transcriptional level in the brain, mice treated with 17β-estradiol (CPZ+EST) showed a decrease in the levels of M1-assosicted microglia markers (CD86, iNOS and MHC-II) whereas M2-associated genes (Arg-1, CD206 and Trem-2) were increased, compared to CPZ mice. Moreover, administration of 17β-estradiol resulted in a significant reduction (∼3-fold) in transcript levels of NLRP3 inflammasome and its downstream product IL-18, compared to controls. In summary, this study demonstrated for the first time that exogenous 17β-estradiol therapy robustly leads to the reduction of M1 phenotype, stimulation of polarized M2 microglia, and repression of NLRP3 inflammasome in the corpus callosum of CPZ demyelination model of MS. The positive effects of 17β-estradiol on microglia and inflammasome seems to facilitate and accelerate the remyelination process. © 2021 IBRO</p>"
115,2-s2.0-85107272259,A Novel Lysolecithin Model for Visualizing Damage in vivo in the Larval Zebrafish Spinal Cord,"<p>Background: Lysolecithin is commonly used to induce demyelinating lesions in the spinal cord and corpus callosum of mammalian models. Although these models and clinical patient samples are used to study neurodegenerative diseases, such as multiple sclerosis (MS), they do not allow for direct visualization of disease-related damage in vivo. To overcome this limitation, we created and characterized a focal lysolecithin injection model in zebrafish that allows us to investigate the temporal dynamics underlying lysolecithin-induced damage in vivo. Results: We injected lysolecithin into 4–6 days post-fertilization (dpf) zebrafish larval spinal cords and, coupled with in vivo, time-lapse imaging, observed hallmarks consistent with mammalian models of lysolecithin-induced demyelination, including myelinating glial cell loss, myelin perturbations, axonal sparing, and debris clearance. Conclusion: We have developed and characterized a lysolecithin injection model in zebrafish that allows us to investigate myelin damage in a living, vertebrate organism. This model may be a useful pre-clinical screening tool for investigating the safety and efficacy of novel therapeutic compounds that reduce damage and/or promote repair in neurodegenerative disorders, such as MS. © Copyright © 2021 Morris and Kucenas.</p>"

117,2-s2.0-85105706340,Quantitative analysis of demyelination and remyelination in modified cuprizone mice model based on T<inf>2</inf>WI combined with DTI using 7.0 T MR,"<p>Objective: To explore the method of establishing a modified demyelination and myelination regeneration model induced by dicyclohexanone oxalyl dihydrazone (CPZ) in mice with multiple sclerosis (MS), and to analyze the image markers of demyelination and myelination regeneration in mouse MS model. Methods: After the intragastrically administered with sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (CMCNa) for one week, a total of 30 C57BL/6 male mice were randomly divided into the control group (n=10), the demyelination group (n=10), and the remyelination group (n=10). The mice of the control group were immediately performed MR scanning and pathological specimen obtaining; the mice in the demyelination group were administered with intragastrical CPZ-CMCNa once a day for 6 weeks for inducing demyelination, then received MR scanning and specimen obtaining with the same protocols used in control group; the mice in the remyelination group were administered with intragastrical CPZ-CMCNa once a day for six weeks for demyelination, then CPZ was withdrawn and normal diet was given for another four weeks. Then MR scanning and specimen obtaining were performed with the same protocols used in the other two groups. Regions of interest (ROIs) were set at the rostrum of corpus callosum (rCC), the bilateral normal appearing white matters (NAWM) of the rostrum of corpus callosum, and the bilateral cerebral cortex (Cx). The normalized T<sub>2</sub>WI (T<sub>2-normalized</sub>), fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (AD), and radial diffusivity (RD) values were compared among the three groups by one-way ANOVA. Results: The demyelination and remyelination mice model of MS were successfully established. The T<sub>2-normalized</sub> values of rCC in control group, demyelination group and remyelination group were 0.47±0.03, 0.72±0.04, 0.54±0.04, respectively, with statistically significant difference found (F=90.511, P&lt;0.05). Post-hoc multiple comparisons showed significant differences among those groups (P&lt;0.05). There was no significant difference of T<sub>2-normalized</sub> value in NAWM and Cx among the three groups (P&gt;0.05). Moreover, there were significant differences in the FA values (0.36±0.04, 0.29±0.03, and 0.32±0.05), the MD values [(0.572±0.015), (0.598±0.034), and (0.626±0.043)×10<sup>-3</sup> mm<sup>2</sup>/s], the AD values [(0.79±0.04), (0.77±0.06), and (0.83±0.04)×10<sup>-3</sup> mm<sup>2</sup>/s], and the RD values [(0.46±0.02), (0.51±0.03), and (0.53±0.05)×10<sup>-3</sup> mm<sup>2</sup>/s] of rCC of the control group, the demyelination group, and the remyelination group (all P&lt;0.05). Significant difference was found in FA values between the demyelination group and the control group (P&lt;0.05), and in MD values between the remyelination group and the control group (P&lt;0.05), as well as in AD values between the remyelination group and the demyelination group (P&lt;0.05). There were also significant differences in RD values between the remyelination group and the control group, and the demyelination group and the control group (all P&lt;0.05). However, no significant difference was found in all diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) metrics of NAWM and Cx among the three groups (all P&gt;0.05). The LFB-eosin staining showed that the myelin sheath of rCC was lost in the demyelination group, and the rCC was partially regenerated and repaired in the remyelination group. Conclusion: The modified CPZ-CMCNa model can selectively induce demyelination and remyelination of rCC, and the changes of demyelination and remyelination of rCC in the modified CPZ-CMCNa model can be quantitatively detected by T<sub>2</sub>WI combined with DTI, which might provide related theoretical basis for the study on dynamic changes of MS lesions. © 2021 Chinese Medical Association</p>"
118,2-s2.0-85109025753,Brain microstructural and metabolic alterations detected in vivo at onset of the first demyelinating event,"<p>In early multiple sclerosis, a clearer understanding of normal-brain tissue microstructural and metabolic abnormalities will provide valuable insights into its pathophysiology. We used multi-parametric quantitative MRI to detect alterations in brain tissues of patients with their first demyelinating episode. We acquired neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging [to investigate morphology of neurites (dendrites and axons)] and 23Na MRI (to estimate total sodium concentration, a reflection of underlying changes in metabolic function). In this cross-sectional study, we enrolled 42 patients diagnosed with clinically isolated syndrome or multiple sclerosis within 3 months of their first demyelinating event and 16 healthy controls. Physical and cognitive scales were assessed. At 3 T, we acquired brain and spinal cord structural scans, and neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging. Thirty-two patients and 13 healthy controls also underwent brain 23Na MRI. We measured neurite density and orientation dispersion indices and total sodium concentration in brain normal-appearing white matter, white matter lesions, and grey matter. We used linear regression models (adjusting for brain parenchymal fraction and lesion load) and Spearman correlation tests (significance level P ≤ 0.01). Patients showed higher orientation dispersion index in normal-appearing white matter, including the corpus callosum, where they also showed lower neurite density index and higher total sodium concentration, compared with healthy controls. In grey matter, compared with healthy controls, patients demonstrated: lower orientation dispersion index in frontal, parietal and temporal cortices; lower neurite density index in parietal, temporal and occipital cortices; and higher total sodium concentration in limbic and frontal cortices. Brain volumes did not differ between patients and controls. In patients, higher orientation dispersion index in corpus callosum was associated with worse performance on timed walk test (P = 0.009, B = 0.01, 99% confidence interval = 0.0001 to 0.02), independent of brain and lesion volumes. Higher total sodium concentration in left frontal middle gyrus was associated with higher disability on Expanded Disability Status Scale (rs = 0.5, P = 0.005). Increased axonal dispersion was found in normal-appearing white matter, particularly corpus callosum, where there was also axonal degeneration and total sodium accumulation. The association between increased axonal dispersion in the corpus callosum and worse walking performance implies that morphological and metabolic alterations in this structure could mechanistically contribute to disability in multiple sclerosis. As brain volumes were neither altered nor related to disability in patients, our findings suggest that these two advanced MRI techniques are more sensitive at detecting clinically relevant pathology in early multiple sclerosis. © 2021 The Author(s).

119,2-s2.0-85104947984,Exploratory study on neurochemical effects of low-intensity pulsed ultrasound in brains of mice,"<p>There is now a relatively large body of evidence suggesting a relationship between dysfunction of myelin and oligodendrocytes and the etiology of several neuropsychiatric disorders, including depression and schizophrenia, and also suggesting that ultrasound methods may alleviate some of the symptoms of depression. We have applied low-intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS) to the brains of mice treated with the demyelinating drug cuprizone, a drug that has been used as the basis for a rodent model relevant to a number of psychiatric and neurologic disorders including depression, schizophrenia, and multiple sclerosis. Prior to conducting the studies in mice, preliminary studies were carried out on the effects of LIPUS in vitro in neuron-like SH-SY5Y cells and primary glial cells. In subsequent studies in mice, female C57BL/6 mice were restrained in plastic tubes for 20 min daily with the ultrasound transducer near the end of the tube directly above the mouse’s head. LIPUS was used at an intensity of 25 mW/cm<sup>2</sup> once daily for 22 days in control mice and in mice undergoing daily repetitive restraint stress (RRS). Behavioral or neurochemical studies were done on the mice or the brain tissue obtained from them. The studies in vitro indicated that LIPUS stimulation at an intensity of 15 mW/cm<sup>2</sup> delivered for 5 min daily for 3 days in an enclosed sterile cell culture plate in an incubator increased the viability of SH-SY5Y and primary glial cells. In the studies in mice, LIPUS elevated levels of doublecortin, a marker for neurogenesis, in the cortex compared to levels in the RRS mice and caused a trend in elevation of brain levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor in the hippocampus relative to control levels. LIPUS also increased sucrose preference (a measure of the attenuation of anhedonia, a common symptom of several psychiatric disorders) in the RRS model in mice. The ability of LIPUS administered daily to rescue damaged myelin and oligodendrocytes was studied in mice treated chronically with cuprizone for 35 days. LIPUS increased cortex and corpus callosum levels of myelin basic protein, a protein marker for mature oligodendrocytes, and neural/glial antigen 2, a protein marker for oligodendrocyte precursor cells, relative to levels in the cuprizone + sham animals. These results of this exploratory study suggest that future comprehensive time-related studies with LIPUS on brain chemistry and behavior related to neuropsychiatric disorders are warranted.

120,2-s2.0-85101430303,The beneficial role of the synthetic microneurotrophin BNN20 in a focal demyelination model,"<p>BNN20, a C17-spiroepoxy derivative of the neurosteroid dehydroepiandrosterone, has been shown to exhibit strong neuroprotective properties but its role in glial populations has not been assessed. Our aim was to investigate the effect of BNN20 on glial populations by using in vitro and in vivo approaches, taking advantage of the well-established lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC)-induced focal demyelination mouse model. Our in vivo studies, performed in male mice, showed that BNN20 treatment leads to an increased number of mature oligodendrocytes (OLs) in this model. It diminishes astrocytic accumulation during the demyelination phase leading to a faster remyelination process, while it does not affect oligodendrocyte precursor cell recruitment or microglia/macrophage accumulation. Additionally, our in vitro studies showed that BNN20 acts directly to OLs and enhances their maturation even after they were treated with LPC. This beneficial effect of BNN20 is mediated, primarily, through the neurotrophin receptor TrkA. In addition, BNN20 reduces microglial activation and their transition to their pro-inflammatory state upon lipopolysaccharides stimulation in vitro. Taken together our results suggest that BNN20 could serve as an important molecule to develop blood–brain barrier-permeable synthetic agonists of neurotrophin receptors that could reduce inflammation, protect and increase the number of functional OLs by promoting their differentiation/maturation. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC</p>"
121,2-s2.0-85101425445,Deep Learning Corpus Callosum Segmentation as a Neurodegenerative Marker in Multiple Sclerosis,"<p>Background and Purpose: Corpus callosum atrophy is a sensitive biomarker of multiple sclerosis (MS) neurodegeneration but typically requires manual 2D or volumetric 3D-based segmentations. We developed a supervised machine learning algorithm, DeepnCCA, for corpus callosum segmentation and relate callosal morphology to clinical disability using conventional MRI scans collected in clinical routine. Methods: In a prospective study of 553 MS patients with 704 acquisitions, 200 unique 2D T<sub>2</sub>-weighted MRI scans were delineated to develop, train, and validate DeepnCCA. Comparative FreeSurfer segmentations were obtained in 504 3D T<sub>1</sub>-weighted scans. Both FreeSurfer and DeepnCCA outputs were correlated with clinical disability. Using principal component analysis of the DeepnCCA output, the morphological changes were explored in relation to clinical disease burden. Results: DeepnCCA and manual segmentations had high similarity (Dice coefficients 98.1 (Formula presented.).11%, 89.3 (Formula presented.).76%, for intracranial and corpus callosum area, respectively through 10-fold cross-validation). DeepnCCA had numerically stronger correlations with cognitive and physical disability as compared to FreeSurfer: Expanded disability status scale (EDSS) ±6 months (r = –.22 P =.002; r = –.17, P =.013), future EDSS (r = –.26, P&lt;.001; r = –.17, P =.012), and future symbol digit modalities test (r =.26, P =.001; r =.24, P =.003). The corpus callosum became thinner with increasing cognitive and physical disability. Increasing physical disability, additionally, significantly correlated with a more angled corpus callosum. Conclusions: DeepnCCA (https://github.com/plattenmichael/DeepnCCA/) is an openly available tool that can provide fast and accurate corpus callosum measurements applicable to large MS cohorts, potentially suitable for monitoring disease progression and therapy response. © 2021 The Authors.

122,2-s2.0-85101147973,Exposure to fine particulate matter (PM<inf>2.5</inf>) hampers myelin repair in a mouse model of white matter demyelination,"<p>Epidemiological studies show a strong association between exposure to air pollution – and particularly to particulate matter (PM) -, increased prevalence of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and higher rates of hospital admissions for MS and MS relapses. Besides having immunomodulatory effects and sustaining a systemic oxidative-inflammatory response, PM may participate in MS pathogenesis by targeting also Central Nervous System (CNS)-specific processes, such as myelin repair. Here we show that, in a mouse model of lysolecithin-induced demyelination of the subcortical white matter, post-injury exposure to fine PM hampers remyelination, disturbs oligodendroglia differentiation dynamics and promotes astroglia and microglia reactivity. These findings support the view that exposure to fine PM can contribute to demyelinating pathologies by targeting the endogenous regenerative capability of the CNS tissue. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd</p>"
123,2-s2.0-85099350050,Relation of retinal and hippocampal thickness in patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment and healthy controls,"<p>Objective: Investigating retinal thickness may complement existing biological markers for dementia and other neurodegenerative diseases. Although retinal thinning is predictive for cognitive decline, it remains to be investigated if and how this feature aligns with neurodegeneration elsewhere in the brain, specifically in early disease stages. Methods: Using optical coherence tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, we examined retinal thickness as well as hippocampal structure in patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment and healthy controls. Results: The groups did not differ in hippocampal and retinal thickness measures. However, we detected a correlation of peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer thickness and hippocampal thickness in healthy people but not in cognitively impaired patients. The ratio of hippocampus to retina thickness was significantly smaller in patients with mild cognitive impairment and correlated positively with cognitive performance. Conclusions: Different temporal trajectories of neurodegeneration may disrupt transregional brain structure associations in patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment. © 2021 The Authors.

124,2-s2.0-85093937646,BALB/c mice infected with Angiostrongylus cantonensis: A new model for demyelination in the brain,"<p>In this study, we present a new model for demyelination of the central nervous system (CNS). BALB/c mice were infected with Angiostrongylus cantonensis and analyzed 7, 14, and 21 days postinfection. Neurological scale evaluation, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), histology, real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and western blotting were all performed on days 7, 14, and 21. The results showed that the neurological functions and weight of A. cantonensis-infected mice decreased markedly after 21 days of infection. MRI showed subdural effusion and white high signals in the corpus callosum in both T1WI and T2WI, while hematoxylin and eosin and luxol fast blue staining showed hemorrhage and demyelination in the corpus callosum. Transmission electron microscopy revealed that the ultrastructure of the myelin sheath in the corpus callosum was dispersed or disintegrated. The percentage of myelinated axons was significantly decreased, and the g-ratio was lower than that in the normal group. Both protein and mRNA levels of myelin basic protein decreased markedly at 21 days postinfection. Immunofluorescence revealed that the number of CC1 positive cells in the corpus callosum also decreased, which confirmed the damage of A. cantonensis to oligodendrocytes. Our experiments confirmed that A. cantonensis infection caused demyelination in the CNS of BALB/c mice after 21 days, and its clinical manifestations and pathological changes were similar to those of multiple sclerosis and other CNS demyelination models. Thus, mice infected with A. cantonensis could be used as a new model to study acute demyelination of the CNS. © 2021 American Association for Anatomy</p>"
125,2-s2.0-85091680329,The effect of microglial ablation and mesenchymal stem cell transplantation on a cuprizone-induced demyelination model,"<p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a demyelinating autoimmune disease of the central nervous system with symptoms such as neuroinflammation, astrocytosis, microgliosis, and axonal degeneration. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) with their immunomodulation, differentiation, and neuroprotection abilities can influence the remyelination process. The goal of this study is to investigate the impact of microglial ablation and MSCs transplantation on remyelination processes in the corpus callosum (CC) of the cuprizone demyelination model. For the induction of a chronic demyelination model, C57BL6 mice were fed with chow containing 0.2% cuprizone (wt/wt) for 12 weeks. For the depletion of microglia, PLX3397 was used as a colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor inhibitor for 21 days. MSCs were injected to the right lateral ventricle and after 2 weeks, the mice were killed. We assessed glial cells using specific markers such as APC, Iba-1, and GFAP using the immunohistochemistry method. Remyelination was evaluated by Luxol fast blue (LFB) staining and transmission electron microscope (TEM). The specific genes of microglia and MSCs were evaluated by a quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. According to the results of the study, 21 days of PLX3397 treatment significantly reduced microglial cells, and MSCs transplantation decreased the number of astrocytes, whereas the oligodendrocytes population increased significantly in PLX + MSC group in comparison with the cuprizone mice. Furthermore, PLX and MSC treatment elevated levels of remyelination compared with the cuprizone group, as confirmed by LFB staining and TEM analysis. The molecular results showed that MSC transplantation significantly decreased the number of microglia through the CX3CL1/CX3CR1 axis. These results revealed that PLX3397 treatment and MSCs injection reduced microgliosis and astrocytosis. It also increased the oligodendrocytes population by enhancing remyelination in the CC of the cuprizone model of MS. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC</p>"
126,2-s2.0-85087973033,Long-term course and morphological MRI correlates of cognitive function in multiple sclerosis,"<p>Background: Cognitive impairment frequently occurs in patients with MS (pwMS). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) markers could help to identify patients at risk for decline. Objective: To characterize the long-term course and morphological MRI correlates of cognitive function in pwMS. Methods: We invited 116 pwMS who had undergone clinical, cognitive, and MRI evaluations between 2006 and 2012 (baseline, BL) to attend follow-up (FU) testing between 2016 and 2018. Disability (expanded disability status scale (EDSS)), cognition (brief repeatable battery of neuropsychological test (BRB-N)), global and regional T2-lesion load (T2-LL), brain volumes, and cortical thickness were assessed. Results: Sixty-three pwMS were willing to attend the FU (54%; median EDSS = 2, interquartile range (IQR) = 2) and did not differ from non-participating pwMS regarding BL characteristics. At BL, half of the participants showed cognitive deficits in at least one domain. Across the entire group, we observed no relevant changes in physical disability and cognition over 10 years. BL thalamic volume best predicted cognitive function at FU, in addition to age and BL cognition, explaining 67% of variance. Cognitive decliners (23.8%) were older, had longer disease duration, and a tendency for lower thalamic volume at BL. Conclusion: Thalamic volume predicted FU cognitive function and distinguished declining from stable pwMS, underlining the potential of MRI to define risk groups. © The Author(s), 2020.</p>"
127,2-s2.0-85087935668,Measurement of white matter fiber-bundle cross-section in multiple sclerosis using diffusion-weighted imaging,"<p>Background: When investigating white matter (WM) microstructure, the axonal fiber orientation should be considered. Constrained spherical deconvolution (CSD) is a diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) method that estimates distribution of fibers within each imaging voxel. Objective: To study fiber-bundle cross-section (FC) as measured by CSD in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients versus healthy controls (HCs). Methods: DWI and three-dimensional (3D) T<sub>1</sub>-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were obtained from 45 MS patients and 45 HCs. We applied fixel-based morphometry analysis to assess differences of FC in MS against HCs and voxel-based analysis of fractional anisotropy (FA). Results: We found a significant widespread reduction of WM FC in MS compared to HCs. The decrease in FA was less extensive, mainly located in regions with high lesion occurrence such as the periventricular WM and the corpus callosum. Progressive MS patients showed a significant FC reduction in the right anterior cingulum, bilateral cerebellum, and in several mesencephalic and diencephalic regions compared to relapsing-remitting MS patients. Conclusion: The CSD method can be applied in MS for a fiber-specific study of WM microstructure and quantification of FC. Fixel-based findings offered greater anatomical specificity and biological interpretability by identifying tract-specific differences and allowed substantial abnormalities to be detected. © The Author(s), 2020.</p>"
128,2-s2.0-85104603768,Co-existence of multiple sclerosis and germinoma in an adult male: Case report,"<p>Background: Concurrent diagnosis of multiple sclerosis (MS) and the central nervous system (CNS) germinoma is rare. The diagnostic criteria for MS rely primarily on clinical presentation, and CNS germinoma can present as an MS mimic. These factors contribute to the rarity of dual diagnosis. Case Description: A 28-year-old man presented initially with bilateral optic neuritis, manifesting as persistently worsening vision for 2 years, and demyelinating plaques identified within the corpus callosum on magnetic resonance imaging. Initial work-up, in addition to clinical presentation, led to diagnosis of MS. Three months following the diagnosis of MS, the patient then presented with obstructive hydrocephalus due to a newly diagnosed intraventricular mass. The patient underwent an endoscopic third ventriculostomy and biopsy which confirmed diagnosis of CNS germinoma. Conclusion: To the best of our knowledge, dual presentation of both MS and CNS germinoma has never been reported in the literature. The clinical presentation of bilateral optic neuritis (persisting for roughly 2 years before initial MS diagnosis), demyelinating plaques, and intrathecal oligoclonal bands before the development of an intraventricular mass indicates that both MS and CNS germinoma presented simultaneously in this patient. The treatment plan for this patient included carboplatin + etoposide, followed by adjuvant radiation and subsequent IVIG therapy. © 2021 Published by Scientific Scholar on behalf of Surgical Neurology International</p>"

METHODS: This prospective study was approved by the institutional review board. 92 subjects were recruited, including 46 relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) patients and 46 healthy controls (HC). Of the 46 patients, 22 patients experienced the treatment of BSYSD for half a year. A conventional three-dimensional T1-weighted sequence were acquired for all participants on a 3.0 tesla magnetic resonance system. Basic information, detailed cognitive scales Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), symbol digit modalities test (SDMT), immediate memory, delayed recall, and long-term recognition were evaluated. Subcortical gray matter volume and cortical thickness weremeasured by FreeSurfer. The correlations between cortical thickness which MS patients showed reduced with respect to HC and cognitive scales wereanalyzed by Pearson correlation in RRMS patients. The influence of modified BSYSD on MS patients' cognition was analyzed by paired T Test. RESULTS: MoCA, immediate memory, delayed recall, and long-term delayed recognition in RRMS were significantly decreased than those of HC. Gray matter atrophy measured by FreeSurfer showed mainly in thalamus and hippocampus of RRMS patients. Compared with HC, the cortical thickness of several regions in frontal lobe, parietal lobe, temporal lobe, hippocampal, cingulate gyrus, and fusiform gyrus of RRMS patients were decreased with significant difference. The regions of cortical thickness thinning related to MoCA, immediate memory, delayed recall, and long-term delayed recognition were temporal lobe and fusiform gyrus. Modified BSYSD could improve MoCA, SDMT, immediate memory, delayed recall, and long-term delayed recognition of MS patients, and it could promote the recovery of cognitive function in MS patients. CONCLUSIONS: Gray matter atrophy and cortical thickness thinning were validated in RRMS. Cortical thickness thinning of temporal lobe and fusiform gyrus strongly related to cognitive deficits in RRMS. The modified BSYSD could promote the recovery of cognitive function in MS. © 2021 JTCM.

130,2-s2.0-85103255288,Coronavirus disease (COVID-19)-related disseminated leukoencephalopathy: a retrospective study of findings on brain MRI,"<p>Among 2820 inpatients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19), 59 (2.1%) underwent brain MRI. Of them, six (10.2%) had MRI findings suspicious for COVID-19–related disseminated leukoencephalopathy (CRDL), which is characterized by extensive confluent or multifocal white matter lesions (with characteristics and locations atypical for other causes), microhemorrhages, diffusion restriction, and enhancement. CRDL is an uncommon but important differential consideration in patients with neurologic manifestations of COVID-19. Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is well known to cause multifocal pneumonia. Increasingly, effects of COVID-19 on the brain are being reported, including acute necrotizing encephalopathy, infarcts, microhemorrhage, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, and leukoencephalopathy [1–8]. We retrospectively reviewed brain MRI examinations in patients with COVID-19 for findings suspicious for COVID-19–related disseminated leukoencephalopathy (CRDL). Methods This retrospective, HIPAA-compliant, institutional review board–approved study evaluated all patients admitted to our hospital between March 1, 2020, and June 18, 2020, who were determined to have COVID-19 after naso- or oropharyngeal swabs or antibody testing combined with clinical presentation and who underwent brain MRI. Three board-certified neuroradiologists (S.M., A.H., and J.M.) with 14 years, 16 years, and 1 year of experience, respectively, reviewed all MRI examinations, independently and then reaching consensus. Given the absence of established criteria for CRDL, examinations were considered suspicious if they showed multifocal white matter abnormalities with characteristics atypical for other causes (such as chronic small vessel ischemic changes or infarcts) and in atypical locations (such as the bilateral middle cerebellar peduncles and corpus callosum); abnormal T2 prolongation or enhancing lesions that were disproportionately large relative to associated restricted diffusion; or white matter lesions with associated T1 hypointensity suggestive of axonal loss. Spatial distribution of lesions and diffusion characteristics, susceptibility, and enhancement were documented. Results A total of 59 (2.1%) of 2820 inpatients with COVID-19 underwent brain MRI. Three (5.1%) had known white matter lesions from multiple sclerosis, 23 (39.0%) had white matter lesions of small vessel ischemic disease, six (10.2%) had acute infarcts, four (6.8%) had subacute infarcts, four (6.8%) had chronic infarcts, one (1.7%) had abnormal basal ganglia signal from hypoxemia, two (3.4%) had microhemorrhage in association with chronic infarcts, and two (3.4%) had microhemorrhage associated with acute or subacute infarcts. Six patients (10.2%; four women, two men) had neuroimaging findings suggestive of CRDL (mean age ± SD, 64.5 ± 16.3 years [range, 41–86 years]). Hypertension (4/6, 66.7%) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (3/6, 50.0%) were common comorbidities. All six patients had white matter abnormalities on T2-weighted FLAIR images that were confluent in two-thirds and multifocal in the remainder, most frequently affecting the periventricular, subcortical, and deep white matter. Patchy, asymmetric abnormal FLAIR signal was seen in the corpus callosum (5/6, 83.3%), brainstem (4/6, 66.7%), and cerebellum (4/6, 66.7%), including one patient with lesions involving bilateral middle cerebellar peduncles (Fig. 1). Five (83.3%) had restricted diffusion. Four of five (80.0%) patients who underwent T1-weighted imaging had T1 hypointense signal centrally located within these FLAIR abnormalities (so-called black holes), including the patient with bilateral middle cerebellar peduncle lesions. Four patients (66.7%) had microhemorrhages. One patient had supra- and infratentorial enhancing white matter lesions without restricted diffusion (Fig. 2). Two patients had remote prior brain imaging. A 78-year-old woman had undergone head CT 11 months before, and a 41-year-old man had undergone brain MRI 24 months before, confirming the findings suspicious for CRDL were new since those studies. Also, a 66-year-old man underwent follow-up MRI, which showed new foci of abnormality on T2-weighted FLAIR imaging and restricted diffusion on each examination. © American Roentgen Ray Society</p>"
131,2-s2.0-85100451401,Role of thyroid hormones in normal and abnormal central nervous system myelination in humans and rodents,"<p>Thyroid hormones (THs) are instrumental in promoting the molecular mechanisms which underlie the complex nature of neural development and function within the central nervous system (CNS) in vertebrates. The key neurodevelopmental process of myelination is conserved between humans and rodents, of which both experience peak fetal TH concentrations concomitant with onset of myelination. The importance of supplying adequate levels of THs to the myelin producing cells, the oligodendrocytes, for promoting their maturation is crucial for proper neural function. In this review we examine the key TH distributor and transport proteins, including transthyretin (TTR) and monocarboxylate transporter 8 (MCT8), essential for supporting proper oligodendrocyte and myelin health; and discuss disorders with impaired TH signalling in relation to abnormal CNS myelination in humans and rodents. Furthermore, we explore the importance of using novel TH analogues in the treatment of myelination disorders associated with abnormal TH signalling. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.</p>"

However, perturbation in CNS vasculature are hallmarks of both diseases. ELTD1 (epidermal growth factor, latrophilin, and 7 transmembrane domain containing protein 1 on chromosome 1) is associated with vascular development, and has been linked with tumor angiogenesis. In glioblastomas, we detected over-expression of ELTD1, and found that an antibody targeting ELTD1 could increase animal survival and decrease tumor volumes in a xenograft GBM model. RNA-seq analysis of the preclinical data in the model for GBM identified that some of the molecular pathways affected by the anti-ELTD1 antibody therapy are also found to be associated with MS. In this study, we used molecular-targeted (mt) MR imaging and immunohistochemistry to assess ELTD1 levels in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a mouse model of MS. Specifically, we found that ELTD1 is readily detected in the brains of mice with EAE and is predominantly found in the corpus callosum. In addition, we found that the blood-brain barrier (BBB) was compromised in the brains of EAE mice using contrast-enhanced MRI (CE-MRI), as well as altered relative cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in the brains and cervical spinal cords of these mice using perfusion imaging, compared to controls. These findings indicate that ELTD1 may be a promising biomarker for CNS-inflammation in MS. © 2021</p>"
133,2-s2.0-85099903772,Axon-Myelin Unit Blistering as Early Event in MS Normal Appearing White Matter,"<p>Objective: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative disease of unknown etiology. Although the prevalent view regards a CD4<sup>+</sup>-lymphocyte autoimmune reaction against myelin at the root of the disease, recent studies propose autoimmunity as a secondary reaction to idiopathic brain damage. To gain knowledge about this possibility we investigated the presence of axonal and myelinic morphological alterations, which could implicate imbalance of axon-myelin units as primary event in MS pathogenesis. Methods: Using high resolution imaging histological brain specimens from patients with MS and non-neurological/non-MS controls, we explored molecular changes underpinning imbalanced interaction between axon and myelin in normal appearing white matter (NAWM), a region characterized by normal myelination and absent inflammatory activity. Results: In MS brains, we detected blister-like swellings formed by myelin detachment from axons, which were substantially less frequently retrieved in non-neurological/non-MS controls. Swellings in MS NAWM presented altered glutamate receptor expression, myelin associated glycoprotein (MAG) distribution, and lipid biochemical composition of myelin sheaths. Changes in tethering protein expression, widening of nodes of Ranvier and altered distribution of sodium channels in nodal regions of otherwise normally myelinated axons were also present in MS NAWM. Finally, we demonstrate a significant increase, compared with controls, in citrullinated proteins in myelin of MS cases, pointing toward biochemical modifications that may amplify the immunogenicity of MS myelin. Interpretation: Collectively, the impaired interaction of myelin and axons potentially leads to myelin disintegration. Conceptually, the ensuing release of (post-translationally modified) myelin antigens may elicit a subsequent immune attack in MS. ANN NEUROL 2021;89:711–725. © 2021 The Authors.

134,2-s2.0-85099499228,"Nestorone<sup>®</sup>, a 19nor-progesterone derivative boosts remyelination in an animal model of demyelination","<p>Introduction: We previously showed that Nestorone<sup>®</sup> (NES), a synthetic progestin structurally related to progesterone, stimulated remyelination of the corpus callosum in a Cuprizone (CUP) mouse model of demyelination in intact females by promoting replenishment with mature oligodendrocytes (OL) (Glia. 2015;63:104-117). Here, we further investigated the underlying mechanisms of this promyelinating effect. Methods: We explored whether NES, applied subcutaneously through Alzet mini-osmotic pumps, regulates specific transcription factors involved in oligodendrocyte progenitor cell (OPC) proliferation and their differentiation into mature OL, using RT-qPCR and Western Blot analysis. Results: Our present data show that in comparison to controls, a one-week treatment with NES, through Alzet mini-osmotic pumps, enhanced the production of three relevant transcription factor mRNAs encoding Olig2, Myt1, and Sox17. After 3 weeks, NES treatment reversed the effect of CUP on the levels of corresponding Olig2, Myt1, and Sox17 proteins. Moreover, in mice receiving NES + Estradiol (E2) co-treatment, levels of Olig2, Myt1, and Sox17 proteins did not change as compared to NES alone. Conclusion: NES alone or with E2 increased the levels of transcription factors, essential for myelin synthesis. © 2020 The Authors.

135,2-s2.0-85103515576,Exome-Wide Search for Genes Associated With Central Nervous System Inflammatory Demyelinating Diseases Following CHIKV Infection: The Tip of the Iceberg,"<p>Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a re-emergent arbovirus that causes a disease characterized primarily by fever, rash and severe persistent polyarthralgia, although &lt;1% of cases develop severe neurological manifestations such as inflammatory demyelinating diseases (IDD) of the central nervous system (CNS) like acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) and extensive transverse myelitis. Genetic factors associated with host response and disease severity are still poorly understood. In this study, we performed whole-exome sequencing (WES) to identify HLA alleles, genes and cellular pathways associated with CNS IDD clinical phenotype outcomes following CHIKV infection. The cohort includes 345 patients of which 160 were confirmed for CHIKV. Six cases presented neurological manifestation mimetizing CNS IDD. WES data analysis was performed for 12 patients, including the CNS IDD cases and 6 CHIKV patients without any neurological manifestation. We identified 29 candidate genes harboring rare, pathogenic, or probably pathogenic variants in all exomes analyzed. HLA alleles were also determined and patients who developed CNS IDD shared a common signature with diseases such as Multiple sclerosis (MS) and Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorders (NMOSD). When these genes were included in Gene Ontology analyses, pathways associated with CNS IDD syndromes were retrieved, suggesting that CHIKV-induced CNS outcomesmay share a genetic background with other neurological disorders. To our knowledge, this study was the first genome-wide investigation of genetic risk factors for CNS phenotypes in CHIKV infection. Our data suggest that HLA-DRB1 alleles associated with demyelinating diseases may also confer risk of CNS IDD outcomes in patients with CHIKV infection. © Copyright © 2021 Alves-Leon, Ferreira, Herlinger, Fontes-Dantas, Rueda-Lopes, Francisco, Gonçalves, de Araújo, Rêgo, Higa, Gerber, Guimarães, de Menezes, de Paula Tôrres, Maia, Nogueira, França, da Silva, Naurath, Correia, Vasconcelos, Tanuri, Ferreira, Cardoso, Aguiar and de Vasconcelos.</p>"
136,2-s2.0-85102885462,"RAFF-4, Magnetization Transfer and Diffusion Tensor MRI of Lysophosphatidylcholine Induced Demyelination and Remyelination in Rats","<p>Remyelination is a naturally occurring response to demyelination and has a central role in the pathophysiology of multiple sclerosis and traumatic brain injury. Recently we demonstrated that a novel MRI technique entitled Relaxation Along a Fictitious Field (RAFF) in the rotating frame of rank n (RAFFn) achieved exceptional sensitivity in detecting the demyelination processes induced by lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) in rat brain. In the present work, our aim was to test whether RAFF4, along with magnetization transfer (MT) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), would be capable of detecting the changes in the myelin content and microstructure caused by modifications of myelin sheets around axons or by gliosis during the remyelination phase after LPC-induced demyelination in the corpus callosum of rats. We collected MRI data with RAFF4, MT and DTI at 3 days after injection (demyelination stage) and at 38 days after injection (remyelination stage) of LPC (n = 12) or vehicle (n = 9). Cell density and myelin content were assessed by histology. All MRI metrics detected differences between LPC-injected and control groups of animals in the demyelination stage, on day 3. In the remyelination phase (day 38), RAFF4, MT parameters, fractional anisotropy, and axial diffusivity detected signs of a partial recovery consistent with the remyelination evident in histology. Radial diffusivity had undergone a further increase from day 3 to 38 and mean diffusivity revealed a complete recovery correlating with the histological assessment of cell density attributed to gliosis. The combination of RAFF4, MT and DTI has the potential to differentiate between normal, demyelinated and remyelinated axons and gliosis and thus it may be able to provide a more detailed assessment of white matter pathologies in several neurological diseases. © Copyright © 2021 Holikova, Laakso, Salo, Shatillo, Nurmi, Bares, Vanicek, Michaeli, Mangia, Sierra and Gröhn.</p>"
137,2-s2.0-85109040529,Contribution of gray matter atrophy and white matter damage to cognitive impairment in mildly disabled relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis patients,"<p>Cognitive impairment (CI) is frequently present in multiple sclerosis patients. Despite ongoing research, the neurological substrates have not been fully elucidated. In this study we investigated the contribution of gray and white matter in the CI observed in mildly disabled relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) patients. For that purpose, 30 patients with RRMS (median EDSS = 2), and 30 age-and sex-matched healthy controls were studied. CI was assessed using the symbol digit modalities test (SDMT) and the memory alteration test. Brain magnetic resonance imaging, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), voxel-based morphometry (VBM), brain segmentation, thalamic vertex analysis, and connectivity-based thalamic parcellation analyses were performed. RRMS patients scored significantly lower in both cognitive tests. In the patient group, significant atrophy in the thalami was observed. Multiple regression analyses revealed associations between SDMT scores and GM volume in both hemispheres in the temporal, parietal, frontal, and occipital lobes. The DTI results pointed to white matter damage in all thalamocortical connections, the corpus callosum, and several fasciculi. Multiple regression and correlation analyses suggested that in RRMS patients with mild disease, thalamic atrophy and thalamocortical connection damage may lead to slower cognitive processing. Furthermore, white matter damage at specific fasciculi may be related to episodic memory impairment. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.</p>"
138,2-s2.0-85103343653,Prolonging the integrated stress response enhances cns remyelination in an inflammatory environment,"<p>The inflammatory environment of demyelinated lesions in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients contributes to remyelination failure. Inflammation activates a cytoprotective pathway, the integrated stress response (ISR), but it remains unclear whether enhancing the ISR can improve remyelination in an inflammatory environment. To examine this possibility, the remyelination stage of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), as well as a mouse model that incorporates cuprizone-induced demyelination along with CNS delivery of the proinflammatory cytokine IFN-γ were used here. We demonstrate that either genetic or pharmacological ISR enhancement significantly increased the number of remyelinating oligodendrocytes and remyelinated axons in the inflammatory lesions. Moreover, the combined treatment of the ISR modulator Sephin1 with the oligodendrocyte differentiation enhancing reagent bazedoxifene increased myelin thickness of remyelinated axons to pre-lesion levels. Taken together, our findings indicate that prolonging the ISR protects remyelinating oligodendrocytes and promotes remyelination in the presence of inflammation, suggesting that ISR enhancement may provide reparative benefit to MS patients. © Chen et al.</p>"
139,2-s2.0-85103122761,Identification of novel myelin repair drugs by modulation of oligodendroglial differentiation competence,"<p>Background: In multiple sclerosis loss of myelin and oligodendrocytes impairs saltatory signal transduction and leads to neuronal loss and functional deficits. Limited capacity of oligodendroglial precursor cells to differentiate into mature cells is the main reason for inefficient myelin repair in the central nervous system. Drug repurposing constitutes a powerful approach for identification of pharmacological compounds promoting this process. Methods: A phenotypic compound screening using the subcellular distribution of a potent inhibitor of oligodendroglial cell differentiation, namely p57kip2, as differentiation competence marker was conducted. Hit compounds were validated in terms of their impact on developmental cell differentiation and myelination using both rat and human primary cell cultures and organotypic cerebellar slice cultures, respectively. Their effect on spontaneous remyelination was then investigated following cuprizone-mediated demyelination of the corpus callosum. Findings: A number of novel small molecules able to promote oligodendroglial cell differentiation were identified and a subset was found to foster human oligodendrogenesis as well as myelination ex vivo. Among them the steroid danazol and the anthelminthic parbendazole were found to increase myelin repair. Interpretation: We provide evidence that early cellular processes involved in differentiation decisions are applicable for the identification of regeneration promoting drugs and we suggest danazol and parbendazole as potent therapeutic candidates for demyelinating diseases.

Those drugs have the potential to reduce the frequency of new lesions but do not directly promote remyelination in the damaged central nervous system (CNS). Targeting CXCR7 (ACKR3) has been postulated as a potential therapeutic approach in demyelinating diseases, leading to both immunomodulation by reducing leukocyte infiltrates and promyelination by enhancing myelin repair. ACT-1004-1239 is a potent, selective, insurmountable, and orally available first-in-class CXCR7 receptor antagonist. The effect of ACT-1004-1239 was evaluated in the myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)-induced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) and the cuprizone-induced demyelination mouse models. In addition, ACT-1004-1239 was assessed in a rat oligodendrocyte precursor cell (OPC) differentiation assay in vitro. In the MOG-induced EAE model, ACT-1004-1239 treatment (10-100 mg/kg, twice daily, orally) showed a significant dose-dependent reduction in disease clinical scores, resulting in increased survival. At the highest dose tested (100 mg/kg, twice daily), ACT-1004-1239 delayed disease onset and significantly reduced immune cell infiltrates into the CNS and plasma neurofilament light chain concentration. Treatment with ACT-1004-1239 dose-dependently increased plasma CXCL12 concentration, which correlated with a reduction of the cumulative disease score. Furthermore, in the cuprizone model, ACT-1004-1239 treatment significantly increased the number of mature myelinating oligodendrocytes and enhanced myelination in vivo. In vitro, ACT-1004-1239 promoted the maturation of OPCs into myelinating oligodendrocytes. These results provide evidence that ACT-1004-1239 both reduces neuroinflammation and enhances myelin repair substantiating the rationale to explore its therapeutic potential in a clinical setting. © 2021 Idorsia Pharmaceuticals Ltd.

It is assumed that white matter fiber alterations cause a localized cerebral vasoreactivity (CVR) disruption through astrocytes metabolism alteration, leading to hypoperfusion. We proposed to (1) evaluate the CVR disruptions in MS, (2) in relation to white matter lesions and (3) compare CVR disruptions maps with standard imaging biomarkers. Thirty-five MS patients (10 progressive, 25 relapsing–remitting) and 22 controls underwent MRI with hypercapnic challenge, DTI imaging and neuropsychological assessment. Areas with disrupted CVR were assessed using a general linear model. Resulting maps were associated with clinical scores, compared between groups, and related to DTI metrics and white matter lesions. MS patients showed stronger disrupted CVR within supratentorial white matter, linking the left anterior insula to both the precentral gyrus and the right middle and superior frontal gyrus through the corpus callosum (P &lt; 0.05, FWE corrected). Patient’s verbal intellectual quotient was negatively associated with a pathway linking both hippocampi to the ispilateral prefrontal cortex (P &lt; 0.05, FWE corrected). Disrupted CVR maps unrelated to DTI metrics and white matter lesions. We have demonstrated for the first time that white matter alterations can be indirectly identified through surrounding vessel alterations, and are related to clinical signs of MS. This offers a new, likely independent marker to monitor MS and supports a mediator role of the astrocytes in the fibers/vessels relationship. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC part of Springer Nature.</p>"

We aim to investigate changes of conventional and advanced MRI measures in lesions and normal-appearing white matter (NAWM) over 2 years in fingolimod-treated patients. METHODS: Fifty relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis patients and 27 healthy controls were enrolled in the study and underwent baseline, 1-year, and 2-year 3T MRI scans. T2 lesion volume, whole brain volume, cortical gray matter volume, white matter volume, corpus callosum area, percentage brain volume change (PBVC), Expanded Disability Status Scale, gadolinium-enhancing lesions, PBVC, magnetization transfer ratio (MTR), and diffusion tensor imaging metrics (fractional anisotropy [FA] and median diffusivity [MD]) in lesions and NAWM were calculated. Longitudinal changes were examined using one-way repeated measures ANOVA. Bonferroni correction for multiple testing was used when appropriate. RESULTS: Conventional MRI measures were unchanged in both groups. Lesion MTR increased significantly (P &lt;.001), but NAWM-MTR remained unchanged. Lesion FA improved significantly in year 1 (P =.003) and over the study duration (P =.05). Lesion MD changed significantly from baseline to year 1 (P &lt;.001) and remained stable over 2 years. NAWM-FA was significant from baseline to year 1 (P =.002) and from baseline to year 2 (P &lt;.001). NAWM-MD was significant only from baseline to year 1 (P =.001). CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest a possible neuroreparative effect of fingolimod on the MS lesions and NAWM.

Objectives: To determine the frequency of alexithymia in MS and investigate MS-related abnormalities in structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and their associations with fatigue and cognitive functions. Methods: Ninety-five patients at all stages of the disease were examined: 21 with clinically isolated syndromes (CIS), 30 with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS), 21 with primary (PP) and 23 with secondary progressive MS (SPMS). Alexithymia was measured with the Toronto alexithymia scale (TAS-20) and correlated to cognitive functions, depression, and fatigue. Voxel-based morphometry MRI was analyzed to determine lesion load, cerebral and regional atrophy. Results: Fifty-seven of patients had alexithymia with no significant difference between the clinical phenotypes. Alexithymic patients differed from non-alexithymic patients on fatigue, depression and information processing speed. Compared to non-alexithymic patients, alexithymic patients had decreased volumes of cerebral and cerebellar white matter and there was a significant relationship between alexithymia and decreased brainstem, thalamic and corpus callosum volume. Conclusion: Regardless of the phenotype of MS, alexithymia is associated with atrophy of cerebral and cerebellar white matter, brainstem, corpus callosum, and thalami. © 2020 Elsevier Masson SAS</p>"

To mimic the disease, mice are fed a cuprizone-supplemented diet for 5 weeks, which leads to demyelination of white and grey matter regions, with the corpus callosum being the most susceptible to cuprizone intoxication. Although this model is highly exploited, classical behavioural tests showed inconsistent results. Objective: In our study, we aimed to use the automated system Intellicage to phenotype the behaviour of cuprizone-fed mice. Methods: Mice were continuously monitored during the 5 weeks of intoxication in their home cages, with minimal interference from the experimenter. Mice were assessed for spontaneous activity, fine movements, and impulsivity. Results: Consistently, cuprizone-fed mice showed reduced activity and impulsivity throughout the test period. These behavioral results were confirmed by repeating the battery of behavioral tests in a second cohort of cuprizone-fed mice. Our results suggest that the behavioural phenotyping of cuprizone-fed mice using Intellicage is reproducible and sensitive enough to detect changes normally missed in standard behavioral test batteries. Conclusion: Using a reproducible and standardized method to assess behavioral changes in mice intoxicated with cuprizone is crucial to better understand the disease as well as the functional outcome of treatments. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.</p>"
146,2-s2.0-85102353061,Effect and Mechanism of Catalpol on Remyelination via Regulation of the NOTCH1 Signaling Pathway,"<p>Promoting the differentiation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) is important for fostering remyelination in multiple sclerosis. Catalpol has the potential to promote remyelination and exert neuroprotective effects, but its specific mechanism is still unclear. Recent studies have shown that the NOTCH1 signaling pathway is involved in mediating OPC proliferation and differentiation. In this study, we elucidated that catalpol promoted OPC differentiation in vivo and vitro and explored the regulatory role of catalpol in specific biomolecular processes. Following catalpol administration, better and faster recovery of body weight and motor balance was observed in mice with cuprizone (CPZ)-induced demyelination. Luxol fast blue staining (LFB) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) showed that catalpol increased the myelinated area and improved myelin ultrastructure in the corpus callosum in demyelinated mice. In addition, catalpol enhanced the expression of CNPase and MBP, indicating that it increased OPC differentiation. Additionally, catalpol downregulated the expression of NOTCH1 signaling pathway-related molecules, such as JAGGED1, NOTCH1, NICD1, RBPJ, HES5, and HES1. We further demonstrated that in vitro, catalpol enhanced the differentiation of OPCs into OLs and inhibited NOTCH1 signaling pathway activity. Our data suggested that catalpol may promote OPC differentiation and remyelination through modulation of the NOTCH1 pathway. This study provides new insight into the mechanism of action of catalpol in the treatment of multiple sclerosis. © Copyright © 2021 Sun, Ji, Zha, Zhao, Xue, Jin and Wang.</p>"

Yet, the limiting factors responsible for poor CNS repair are only partially understood. Here, we test the impact of a Western diet (WD) on phagocyte function in a mouse model of demyelinating injury that requires microglial innate immune function for a regenerative response to occur. We find that WD feeding triggers an ageing-related, dysfunctional metabolic response that is associated with impaired myelin-debris clearance in microglia, thereby impairing lesion recovery after demyelination. Mechanistically, we detect enhanced transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ) signalling, which suppresses the activation of the liver X receptor (LXR)-regulated genes involved in cholesterol efflux, thereby inhibiting phagocytic clearance of myelin and cholesterol. Blocking TGFβ or promoting triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) activity restores microglia responsiveness and myelin-debris clearance after demyelinating injury. Thus, we have identified a druggable microglial immune checkpoint mechanism regulating the microglial response to injury that promotes remyelination. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.</p>"

Methods: Mononuclear cells (MNCs) from CNS lesions, cervical lymph nodes (LNs) and peripheral blood of Japanese macaques (JMs) with JME, and cervical LN and blood MNCs from healthy controls or animals with non-JME conditions were analyzed for the presence of myelin-specific T cells and changes in interleukin 17 (IL-17) and interferon gamma (IFNγ) expression. Results: Demyelinating JME lesions contained CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells specific to myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG), myelin basic protein (MBP), and/or proteolipid protein (PLP). CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell responses were absent in JME peripheral blood, and in age- and sex-matched controls. However, CD4<sup>+</sup> Th1 and Th17 responses were detected in JME peripheral blood versus controls. Cervical LN MNCs from eight of nine JME animals had CD3<sup>+</sup> T cells specific for MOG, MBP, and PLP that were not detected in controls. Mapping myelin epitopes revealed a heterogeneity in responses among JME animals. Comparison of myelin antigen sequences with those of JM rhadinovirus (JMRV), which is found in JME lesions, identified six viral open reading frames (ORFs) with similarities to myelin antigen sequences. Overlapping peptides to these JMRV ORFs did not induce IFNγ responses. Interpretations: JME possesses an immune-mediated component that involves both CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells specific for myelin antigens. JME may shed new light on inflammatory demyelinating disease pathogenesis linked to gamma-herpesvirus infection. © 2021 The Authors.

Here, we analyzed the white matter damage and topological organization of white matter tracts in specific brain regions responsible for cognition in MS. Methods: Brain DTI, rs-fMRI, T1, T2, and T2-FLAIR were acquired for 22 MS subjects and 22 healthy controls. Automatic brain parcellation was performed on T1-weighted images. Skull-stripped T1-weighted intensity inverted images were co-registered to the b0 image. Diffusion-weighted images were processed to perform whole brain tractography. The rs-fMRI data were processed, and the connectivity matrixes were analyzed to identify significant differences in the network of nodes between the two groups using NBS analysis. In addition, diffusion entropy maps were produced from DTI data sets using in-house software. Results: MS subjects exhibited significantly reduced mean FA and entropy in 38 and 34 regions, respectively, out of a total of 54 regions. The connectivity values in both structural and functional analyses were decreased in most regions of the default mode network and in four other cognitive networks in MS subjects compared to healthy controls. MS also induced significant reduction in the normalized hippocampus and corpus callosum volumes; the normalized hippocampus volume was significantly correlated with EDSS scores. Conclusion: MS subjects have significant white matter damage and reduction of FA and entropy in various brain regions involved in cognitive networks.

We aimed to determine the damage to the CC in patients with RRMS using DTI. Material and Methods: A systematic search of English databases (PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Scopus) was performed. Fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (AD) and radial diffusivity (RD) values of DTI were compared between RRMS patients and healthy controls (HC) using Stata 12.0. Results: A total of 461 patients and 365 HC from 15 studies were included. Compared with HC, the FA values of the whole CC (SMD -1.894, P &lt; 0.001), genu (SMD -0.830, P &lt; 0.001) and splenium (SMD -1.431, P &lt; 0.001) of CC were significantly reduced in patients with RRMS. Moreover, the MD values of the whole CC (SMD 1.213, P &lt; 0.001), genu (SMD 0.657, P &lt; 0.001) and splenium (SMD 0.830, P &lt; 0.001) of CC were significantly increased in patients with RRMS. Additionally, the AD values (SMD 0.635, P &lt; 0.001) and RD values (SMD 1.480, P &lt; 0.001) were significantly increased in the whole CC in patients with RRMS. The meta-regression analysis revealed that the male ratio showed a significant effect on the FA reduction in the splenium CC in RRMS patients. Conclusions: These results indicated that DTI parameters were potential biomarkers with increased sensitivity for detecting pathological damage in the CC in patients with RRMS. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.</p>"
152,2-s2.0-85096770787,Coenzyme Q10 enhances remyelination and regulate inflammation effects of cuprizone in corpus callosum of chronic model of multiple sclerosis,"<p>Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, progressive demyelinating disease of the central nervous system that causes the most disability in young people, besides trauma. Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10)—also known as ubiquinone—is an endogenous lipid-soluble antioxidant in the mitochondrial oxidative respiratory chain which can reduce oxidative stress and inflammation, the processes associated with demyelination in MS. Cuprizone (CPZ) intoxication is a well-established model of inducing MS, best for studying demyelination—remyelination. In this study, we examined for the first time the role of CoQ10 in preventing demyelination and induction of remyelination in the chronic CPZ model of MS. 40 male mice were divided into four groups. 3 group chewed CPZ-containing food for 12 weeks to induce MS. After 4 weeks, one group were treated with CoQ10 (150 mg/kg/day) by daily gavage until the end of the experiment, while CPZ poisoning continued. At the end of 12 weeks, tail suspension test (TST) and open field test (OFT) was taken and animals were sacrificed to assess myelin basic protein (MBP), oligodendrocyte transcription factor-1 (Olig1), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin 6 (IL-6) by real-time polymerase chain reaction (real-time PCR) and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) by Elisa test. Luxol fast blue (LFB) staining was used to evaluate histological changes. CoQ10 administration promoted remyelination in histological findings. MBP and Olig-1 expression were increased significantly in CoQ10 treated group compare to the CPZ-intoxicated group. CoQ10 treatment alleviated stress oxidative status induced by CPZ and dramatically suppress inflammatory biomarkers. CPZ ingestion made no significant difference between normal control group and the CPZ-intoxicated group in TST and OFT. CoQ10 can enhance remyelination in the CPZ model and potentially might have same effects in MS patients. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.</p>"
153,2-s2.0-85082312154,Conversion of diffusely abnormal white matter to focal lesions is linked to progression in secondary progressive multiple sclerosis,"<p>Background: Diffusely abnormal white matter (DAWM) regions are observed in magnetic resonance images of secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS) patients. However, their role in clinical progression is still not established. Objectives: To characterize the longitudinal volumetric and intensity evolution of DAWM and focal white matter lesions (FWML) and assess their associations with clinical outcomes and progression in SPMS. Methods: Data include 589 SPMS participants followed up for 3 years (3951 time points). FWML and DAWM were automatically segmented. Screening DAWM volumes that transformed into FWML at the last visit (DAWM-to-FWML) and normalized T1-weighted intensities (indicating severity of damage) in those voxels were calculated. Results: FWML volume increased and DAWM volume decreased with an increase in disease duration (p &lt; 0.001). The Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) was positively associated with FWML volumes (p = 0.002), but not with DAWM. DAWM-to-FWML volume was higher in patients who progressed (2.75 cm<sup>3</sup> vs. 1.70 cm<sup>3</sup>; p &lt; 0.0001). Normalized T1-weighted intensity of DAWM-to-FWML was negatively associated with progression (p &lt; 0.00001). Conclusion: DAWM transformed into FWML over time, and this transformation was associated with clinical progression. DAWM-to-FWML voxels had greater normalized T1-weighted intensity decrease over time, in keeping with relatively greater tissue damage. Evaluation of DAWM in progressive multiple sclerosis provides a useful measure for therapies aiming to protect this at-risk tissue with the potential to slow progression. © The Author(s), 2020.</p>"

155,2-s2.0-85099769269,Growth Hormone and Neuronal Hemoglobin in the Brain—Roles in Neuroprotection and Neurodegenerative Diseases,"<p>In recent years, evidence for hemoglobin (Hb) synthesis in both animal and human brains has been accumulating. While circulating Hb originating from cerebral hemorrhage or other conditions is toxic, there is also substantial production of neuronal Hb, which is influenced by conditions such as ischemia and regulated by growth hormone (GH), insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), and other growth factors. In this review, we discuss the possible functions of circulating and brain Hb, mainly the neuronal form, with respect to the neuroprotective activities of GH and IGF-I against ischemia and neurodegenerative diseases. The molecular pathways that link Hb to the GH/IGF-I system are also reviewed, although the limited number of reports on this topic suggests a need for further studies. In summary, GH and/or IGF-I appear to be significant determinants of systemic and local brain Hb concentrations through mediating responses to oxygen and metabolic demand, as part of the neuroprotective effects exerted by GH and IGF-I. The nature and quantity of the latter deserve further exploration in specific experiments. © Copyright © 2021 Walser, Svensson, Karlsson, Motalleb, Åberg, Kuhn, Isgaard and Åberg.</p>"
156,2-s2.0-85124056142,Effect of fluoxetine treatment on neurotoxicity induced by lysolecithin in male rats,"<p>Demyelination disorder is an unusual pathologic event, which occurs in the central nervous system (CNS). Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory demyelinating disease that affects the CNS, and it is the leading cause of disability in young adults. Lysolecithin (LPC) is one of the best toxin-induced demyelination models. In this study, a suitable model is created, and the effect of fluoxetine treatment is examined on this model. In this case, it was assumed that daily fluoxetine treatment had increased the endogenous remyelination in the LPC model. This study was focused on investigating the influence of the fluoxetine dose of 5 or 10 mg/kg per day for 1 and 4 weeks on LPC-induced neurotoxicity in the corpus callosum region. It was performed as a demyelinating model in male Wistar rats. After 3 days, fluoxetine was injected intraperitoneally (5 or 10 mg/kg per day) for 1 and 4 weeks in each group. After completing the treatment course, the corpus callosum was removed to examine the gene expression and histological analysis was performed. The results of the histopathological study of hematoxylin and eosin staining of the corpus callosum showed that in 1 and 4-week treatment groups, fluoxetine has reduced the level of inflammation at the LPC injection site (5 and 10 mg/kg per day). Fluoxetine treatment in the luxol fast blue (LFB) staining of the corpus callosum has been led to an increase in myelination capacity in all doses and times. The results of the genetic study showed that the fluoxetine has significantly reduced the expression level of tumor necrosis factor-a, nuclear factor jb, and induced nitric oxide synthase in comparison with the untreated LPC group. Also, the fluoxetine treatment has enhanced the expression level of the forkhead box P3 (FOXP3) gene in comparison with the untreated group. Fluoxetine has increased the expression level of myelination and neurotrophic genes such as myelin basic protein (MBP), oligodendrocyte transcription factor 2 (OLIG2), and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). The outcomes demonstrated that fluoxetine reduces inflammation and strengthens the endogenous myelination in the LPC-induced demyelination model; however, supplementary studies are required for specifying the details of its mechanisms. © Canadian Science Publishing.

157,2-s2.0-85118220236,Investigation of neuro-inflammatory parameters in a cuprizone induced mouse model of multiple sclerosis,"<p>Cuprizone, copper chelator, treatment of mouse is a toxic model of multiple sclerosis (MS) in which oligodendrocyte death, demyelination and remyelination can be observed. Understanding T and B cell subset as well as their cytokines involved in MS pathogenesis still requires further scrutiny to better understand immune component of MS. The study presented here, aimed to evaluate relevant cytokines, lymphocytes, and gene expressions profiles during demyelination and remyelination in the cuprizone mouse model of MS. Eighty male C57BL/6J mice fed with 0.2% cuprizone for eight weeks. Cuprizone has been removed from the diet in the following eight weeks. Cuprizone treated and control mice sacrificed biweekly, and corpus callosum of the brain was investigated by staining. Lymphocyte cells of mice analyzed by flow cytometry with CD3e, CD11b, CD19, CD80, CD86, CD4, CD25 and FOXP3 antibodies. IFN-gamma, IL-1alpha, IL-2, IL-5, IL-6, IL-10, IL-17, TNF-alpha cytokines were analyzed in plasma samples. Neuregulin 1 (Nrg1), ciliary neurotrophic factor (Cntf ) and C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (Cxcr4) gene expressions in corpus callosum sections of the mice brain were quantified. Histochemistry analysis showed that demyelination began at the fourth week of cuprizone administration and total demyelination occurred at the twelfth week in chronic model. Remyelination occurred at the fourth week of following withdrawal of cuprizone from diet. The level of mature and activated T cells, regulatory T cells, T helper cells and mature B cells increased during demyelination and decreased when cuprizone removed from diet. Further, both type 1 and type 2 cytokines together with the proinflammatory cytokines increased. The level of oligodendrocyte maturation and survival genes showed differential gene expression in parallel to that of demyelination and remyelination. In conclusion, for the first-time, involvement of both cellular immune response and antibody response as well as oligodendrocyte maturation and survival factors having role in demyelination and remyelination of cuprizone mouse model of MS have been shown. © TÜBİTAK.</p>"

The goal of this research was to use UPLC-Orbitrap/MS to identify validated biomarkers and explore the metabolic mechanisms of MS in mice. Thirty-two C57BL/6 male mice were randomized into two groups that were fed either normal food or 0.2% CPZ for 11 weeks. The mouse demyelination model was assessed by LFB and the expression of MBP by immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry. The metabolites of the corpus callosum were quantified using UPLC-Orbitrap/MS. The mouse pole climbing experiment was used to assess coordination ability. Multivariate statistical analysis was adopted for screening differential metabolites, and the ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) was used to reveal the metabolite interaction network. We successfully established the demyelination model. The CPZ group slowly lost weight and showed an increased pole climbing time during feeding compared to the CON group. A total of 81 metabolites (VIP&gt;1 and P&lt;0.05) were determined to be enriched in 24 metabolic pathways; 41 metabolites were markedly increased, while 40 metabolites were markedly decreased in the CPZ group. The IPA results revealed that these 81 biomarker metabolites were associated with neuregulin signaling, PI3K-AKT signaling, mTOR signaling, and ERK/MAPK signaling. KEGG pathway analysis showed that two significantly different metabolic pathways were enriched, namely, the glycerophospholipid and sphingolipid metabolic pathways, comprising a total of nine biomarkers. Receiver operating characteristic analysis showed that the metabolites (e.g., PE (16: 0/22: 6(4Z, 7Z, 10Z, 13Z, 16Z, 19Z)), PC (18: 0/22: 4(7Z, 10Z, 13Z, 16Z)), cytidine 5′-diphosphocholine, PS (18: 0/22: 6(4Z, 7Z, 10Z, 13Z, 16Z, 19Z)), glycerol 3-phosphate, SM (d18: 0/16: 1(9Z)), Cer (d18:1/18: 0), galabiosylceramide (d18:1/18: 0), and GlcCer (d18:1/18: 0)) have good discrimination ability for the CPZ group. In conclusion, the differential metabolites have great potential to serve as biomarkers of demyelinating diseases. In addition, we identified metabolic pathways associated with CPZ-induced demyelination pathogenesis, which provided a new perspective for understanding the relationship between metabolites and CNS demyelination pathogenesis. © 2021 Zhijie Zhao et al.</p>"

MethodsA total of 20 mice were randomly divided into experimental group (n=10) and control group (n=10), and were intragastrically administrated with CPZ-carboxymethyl cellulose sodium (CMCNa) suspension and 0.5% CMCNa solution, respectively. In 6 weeks after administration, the mice of both groups were given T1WI and T2WI scanning on 7.0 T MRI, and the SIR value was calculated by linear registration of T1WI and T2WI. Besides, DTI scanning was also conducted in both groups to obtain the diffusion parameters such as fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD). Moreover, pathological observation was performed on cerebral tissues after Luxol fast blue staining for mean grayscale value (MGSV). Then corpus callosum (CC), bilateral cerebral cortex (CTX), bilateral thalamus (THA), and bilateral hippocampus (HIP) were selected as the regions of interest (ROI). SIR, FA, MD and MGSV of above regions were subsequently compared between the experimental and control groups. Finally, pairwise correlation analysis and linear fitting were carried out on the MRI metrics and pathological parameters. ResultsAs compared with the control group, the CC region in the experimental group showed significant demyelinating changes, with lower SIR and FA values and higher MGSV (P&lt;0.05), while the MD value showed no statistical significance (P&gt;0.05). However, in terms of other cerebral regions, there were no significant differences between the 2 groups in SIR, FA, MD and MGSV values (P&gt;0.05). Correlation analysis suggested that both SIR and FA values were negatively correlated with MGSV, with |rSIR|&gt;|rFA|. ConclusionSIR combined with DTI can quantitatively evaluate the demyelination changes of white matter in MS model. © 2021 Journal of Third Military Medical University.</p>"

Most patients present with relapsing-remitting disease courses. Extensive research over recent decades has expounded our insights into the presentations and diagnostic features of MS. Groups of genetic diseases, CADASIL and leukodystrophies, for example, have been frequently misdiagnosed with MS due to some overlapping clinical and radiological features. The delayed identification of these diseases in late adulthood can lead to severe neurological complications.

163,2-s2.0-85106977461,Relapse recovery in multiple sclerosis: Effect of treatment and contribution to long-term disability,"<p>Background: Although recovery from relapses in MS appears to contribute to disability, it has largely been ignored as a treatment endpoint and disability predictor. Objective: To identify demographic and clinical predictors of relapse recovery in the first 3 years and examine its contribution to 10-year disability and MRI outcomes. Methods: Relapse recovery was retrospectively assessed in 360 patients with MS using the return of the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), Functional System Scale and neurologic signs to baseline at least 6 months after onset. Univariate and multivariable models were used to associate recovery with demographic and clinical factors and predict 10-year outcomes. Results: Recovery from relapses in the first 3 years was better in patients who were younger, on disease-modifying treatment, with a longer disease duration and without bowel or bladder symptoms. For every incomplete recovery, 10-year EDSS increased by 0.6 and 10-year timed 25-foot walk increased by 0.5 s. These outcomes were also higher with older age and higher baseline BMI. Ten-year MRI brain atrophy was associated only with older age, and MRI lesion volume was only associated with smoking. Conclusions: Early initiation of disease-modifying treatment in MS was associated with improved relapse recovery, which in turn prevented long-term disability. © The Author(s) 2021.</p>"

165,2-s2.0-85105492884,A window into the future? MRI for evaluation of neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder throughout the disease course,"<p>Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) is a relapsing, inflammatory disease of the central nervous system marked by relapses often associated with poor recovery and long-term disability. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is recognized as an important tool for timely diagnosis of NMOSD as, in combination with serologic testing, it aids in distinguishing NMOSD from possible mimics. Although the role of MRI for disease monitoring after diagnosis is not as well established, MRI may provide important prognostic information and help differentiate between relapses and pseudorelapses. Increasing evidence of subclinical disease activity and the emergence of newly approved, highly effective immunotherapies for NMOSD adjure us to re-evaluate MRI as a tool to guide optimal treatment selection and escalation throughout the disease course. In this article we review the role of MRI in NMOSD diagnosis, prognostication, disease monitoring, and treatment selection. © The Author(s), 2021.</p>"

To this end, 43 patients with multiple sclerosis (24 relapsing-remitting, 19 progressive), and 21 healthy control subjects were enrolled. White matter lesions were classified in T1-isointense, T1-hypointense and black holes. Mean values of diffusion basis spectrum imaging metrics (fibres, restricted and non-restricted fractions, axial and radial diffusivities and fractional anisotropy) were measured from whole brain white matter lesions and from both lesions and normal appearing white matter of the corpus callosum. Significant differences were found between T1-isointense and black holes (P ranging from 0.005 to &lt;0.001) and between lesions' centre and rim (P &lt; 0.001) for all the metrics. When comparing the three subject groups in terms of metrics derived from corpus callosum normal appearing white matter and T2-hyperintense lesions, a significant difference was found between healthy controls and relapsing-remitting patients for all metrics except restricted fraction and fractional anisotropy; between healthy controls and progressive patients for all metrics except restricted fraction and between relapsing-remitting and progressive multiple sclerosis patients for all metrics except fibres and restricted fractions (P ranging from 0.05 to &lt;0.001 for all). Significant associations were found between corpus callosum normal-appearing white matter fibres fraction/non-restricted fraction and the Symbol Digit Modality Test (respectively, r = 0.35, P = 0.043; r = -0.35, P = 0.046), and between black holes radial diffusivity and Expanded Disability Status Score (r = 0.59, P = 0.002). We showed the feasibility of diffusion basis spectrum imaging metrics at 7 T, confirmed the role of the derived metrics in the characterization of lesions and normal appearing white matter tissue in different stages of the disease and demonstrated their clinical relevance.

However, this central nervous disease, which affects the optic nerve and spinal cord, still afflicts many people. And the recurrence rate of this disease is very high, so that many patients become disabled, it is difficult to fundamentally cure. In this paper, according to the imaging characteristics and clinical manifestations of neuromyelitis optica, we collected experimental samples and related data of neuromyelitis optica patients in the Department of Neurology of our hospital. We selected 60 patients who were diagnosed as the research object of this paper, analyzed the relevant situation of brain lesions of neuromyelitis optica, and discussed their age, gender, first symptom, and shadow imaging features and clinical manifestations. This article hopes to analyze the imaging features and clinical manifestations of neuromyelitis optica brain lesions, use clinical features with differentiating evidence to guide clinical diagnosis, and effectively reduce the probability of clinical misdiagnosis. In addition, 20 patients were randomly followed up to understand their remaining symptoms and recurrence. The results of autoantibodies associated with other autoimmune diseases are more likely to be associated with other autoimmune diseases. Brain, skin, subcutaneous, and brain injuries can be areas with multiple sclerosis characteristics different from myositis. Patients with neuromyelitis optica do not have the special phenomenon of lesions perpendicular to the lateral ventricle. The medulla oblongata, pontine, and paraventricular involvement were the most common imaging features, and were also found in the fourth ventricle, around the aqueduct, basal ganglia, and corpus callosum. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd. part of Springer Nature.</p>"

Methods: We retrospectively analysed adult patients at the Royal Melbourne Hospital electronically identified to have ICD codes for MS and seizures and/or epilepsy between 1996 to 2019, utilising paper and electronic-based records. Results: Of the 2,125 MS patients identified, 16 (0.75%) experienced epileptic seizures during a mean follow-up period of 12.9 years. Median age of MS diagnosis (SD) was 38 (9.3) years. Four patients had relapsing remitting MS (25%), 10 secondary progressive MS (63.5%), and 2 primary progressive MS (12.5%). More than two-thirds of patients had seizure onset following the diagnosis of MS, and the majority of these had advanced disease (approximate EDSS &gt;6) at the time of seizure onset. Focal onset-seizures occurred in 87.5% of patients with seizures. Conclusion: The estimated prevalence of seizures in our cohort was lower than in previous studies (0.75 vs 2–4%). In most cases, seizures occurred after the diagnosis of MS in the context of advanced disease. Further studies are required to determine if MS disease modifying treatments reduce the risk of seizures in this cohort. © The Author(s) 2021.</p>"

Autophagy constitutes an important part of mTOR signaling. The contribution of microglial autophagy to CNS homeostasis and epilepsy remains to be determined. Here, we report that ATG7KO mice deficient for autophagy in microglia display a marked increase of myelination markers, a higher density of mature oligodendrocytes (ODCs), and altered lengths of the nodes of Ranvier. Moreover, we found that deficiency of microglial autophagy (ATG7KO) leads to increased seizure susceptibility in three seizure models (pilocarpine, kainic acid, and amygdala kindling). We demonstrated that ATG7KO mice develop severe generalized seizures and display nearly 100% mortality to convulsions induced by pilocarpine and kainic acid. In the amygdala kindling model, we observed significant facilitation of contralateral propagation of seizures, a process underlying the development of generalized seizures. Taken together, our results reveal impaired microglial autophagy as a novel mechanism underlying altered homeostasis of ODCs and increased susceptibility to severe and fatal generalized seizures. © 2021 Alam et al.</p>"

The study investigates the neuroprotective effects of krill oil (KO) on the cuprizone (CPZ)-induced demyelination of the MS mouse model. The results suggested that KO treatment can improve the motor abnormalities and cognitive deficit of MS mice, as demonstrated by the open field, rotarod and Morris water maze tests. Meanwhile, the CPZ-induced demyelination of mice was alleviated after KO treatment and KO can attenuate the CPZ-induced oxidative stress. Furthermore, KO reduces M1 microglia activation and promotes M2 microglia polarization in the corpus callosum. Moreover, our studies indicated that KO diminished histone deacetylase (HDAC)3, phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 3 and NF-κB p65 protein expression levels. In conclusion, KO exerts its neuroprotective actions in mice with CPZ-induced demyelination possibly by modulating the HDAC3/STAT3/NF-κB signaling pathways. © 2020 The Author(s)</p>"

173,2-s2.0-85093949484,Machine learning based white matter models with permeability: An experimental study in cuprizone treated in-vivo mouse model of axonal demyelination,"<p>The intra-axonal water exchange time (τ<sub>i</sub>), a parameter associated with axonal permeability, could be an important biomarker for understanding and treating demyelinating pathologies such as Multiple Sclerosis. Diffusion-Weighted MRI (DW-MRI) is sensitive to changes in permeability; however, the parameter has so far remained elusive due to the lack of general biophysical models that incorporate it. Machine learning based computational models can potentially be used to estimate such parameters. Recently, for the first time, a theoretical framework using a random forest (RF) regressor suggests that this is a promising new approach for permeability estimation. In this study, we adopt such an approach and for the first time experimentally investigate it for demyelinating pathologies through direct comparison with histology. We construct a computational model using Monte Carlo simulations and an RF regressor in order to learn a mapping between features derived from DW-MRI signals and ground truth microstructure parameters. We test our model in simulations, and find strong correlations between the predicted and ground truth parameters (intra-axonal volume fraction f: R<sup>2</sup> =0.99, τ<sub>i</sub>: R<sup>2</sup> =0.84, intrinsic diffusivity d: R<sup>2</sup> =0.99). We then apply the model in-vivo, on a controlled cuprizone (CPZ) mouse model of demyelination, comparing the results from two cohorts of mice, CPZ (N=8) and healthy age-matched wild-type (WT, N=8). We find that the RF model estimates sensible microstructure parameters for both groups, matching values found in literature. Furthermore, we perform histology for both groups using electron microscopy (EM), measuring the thickness of the myelin sheath as a surrogate for exchange time. Histology results show that our RF model estimates are very strongly correlated with the EM measurements (ρ = 0.98 for f, ρ = 0.82 for τ<sub>i</sub>). Finally, we find a statistically significant decrease in τ<sub>i</sub> in all three regions of the corpus callosum (splenium/genu/body) of the CPZ cohort (&lt;τ<sub>i</sub>&gt;=310ms/330ms/350ms) compared to the WT group (&lt;τ<sub>i</sub>&gt;=370ms/370ms/380ms). This is in line with our expectations that τ<sub>i</sub> is lower in regions where the myelin sheath is damaged, as axonal membranes become more permeable. Overall, these results demonstrate, for the first time experimentally and in vivo, that a computational model learned from simulations can reliably estimate microstructure parameters, including the axonal permeability. © 2020</p>"
174,2-s2.0-85090134726,Intranasal anti-caspase-1 therapy preserves myelin and glucose metabolism in a model of progressive multiple sclerosis,"<p>Inflammatory demyelination and axonal injury in the central nervous system (CNS) are cardinal features of progressive multiple sclerosis (MS), and linked to activated brain macrophage-like cells (BMCs) including resident microglia and trafficking macrophages. Caspase-1 is a pivotal mediator of inflammation and cell death in the CNS. We investigated the effects of caspase-1 activation and its regulation in models of MS. Brains from progressive MS and non-MS patients, as well as cultured human oligodendrocytes were examined by transcriptomic and morphological methods. Next generation transcriptional sequencing of progressive MS compared to non-MS patients' normal appearing white matter (NAWM) showed induction of caspase-1 as well as other inflammasome-associated genes with concurrent suppression of neuron-specific genes. Oligodendrocytes exposed to TNFα exhibited upregulation of caspase-1 with myelin gene suppression in a cell differentiation state-dependent manner. Brains from cuprizone-exposed mice treated by intranasal delivery of the caspase-1 inhibitor, VX-765 or its vehicle, were investigated in morphological and molecular studies, as well as by fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) imaging. Cuprizone exposure resulted in BMC and caspase-1 activation accompanied by demyelination and axonal injury, which was abrogated by intranasal VX-765 treatment. FDG-PET imaging revealed suppressed glucose metabolism in the thalamus, hippocampus and cortex of cuprizone-exposed mice that was restored with VX-765 treatment. These studies highlight the caspase-1 dependent interactions between inflammation, demyelination, and glucose metabolism in progressive MS and associated models. Intranasal delivery of an anti-caspase-1 therapy represents a promising therapeutic approach for progressive MS and other neuro-inflammatory diseases. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC</p>"
175,2-s2.0-85085548678,Cognitive disturbances in the cuprizone model of multiple sclerosis,"<p>Cognitive problems frequently accompany neurological manifestations of multiple sclerosis (MS). However, during screening of preclinical candidates, assessments of behaviour in mouse models of MS typically focus on locomotor activity. In the present study, we analysed cognitive behaviour of 9 to 10-week-old female C57Bl/6J mice orally administered with the toxin cuprizone that induces demyelination, a characteristic feature of MS. Animals received 400 mg/kg cuprizone daily for 2 or 4 weeks, and their performance was compared with that of vehicle-treated mice. Cuprizone-treated animals showed multiple deficits in short touchscreen-based operant tasks: they responded more slowly to visual stimuli, rewards and made more errors in a simple rule-learning task. In contextual/cued fear conditioning experiments, cuprizone-treated mice showed significantly lower levels of contextual freezing than vehicle-treated mice. Diffusion tensor imaging showed treatment-dependent changes in fractional anisotropy as well as in axial and mean diffusivities in different white matter areas. Lower values of fractional anisotropy and axial diffusivity in cuprizone-treated mice indicated developing demyelination and/or axonal damage. Several diffusion tensor imaging measurements correlated with learning parameters. Our results show that translational touchscreen operant tests and fear conditioning paradigms can reliably detect cognitive consequences of cuprizone treatment. The suggested experimental approach enables screening novel MS drug candidates in longitudinal experiments for their ability to improve pathological changes in brain structure and reverse cognitive deficits. © 2020 The Authors.

Methods: Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) was induced in female SJL/J mice by immunization with PLP<sub>139–151</sub>. Seven symptomatic EAE mice and five controls underwent both PET/CT and MRI studies between 11 and 14 days post-immunization. SPIO was injected i.v. in the same animals immediately after [<sup>18</sup>F]DPA-714 and MRI acquisition was performed after 24 h. Regional brain volumes were defined according to a mouse brain atlas on co-registered PET and SPIO-MRI images. [<sup>18</sup>F]DPA-714 standardized uptake value (SUV) ratios (SUVR), with unaffected neocortex as reference, and SPIO fractional volumes (SPIO-Vol) were generated. Both SUVR and SPIO-Vol values were correlated with the clinical score (CS) and among them. Five EAE and four control mice underwent immunohistochemical analysis with the aim of identifying activated microglia/macrophage and TSPO expressions. Results: SUVR and SPIO-Vol values were significantly increased in EAE compared with controls in the hippocampus (p &lt; 0.01; p &lt; 0.02, respectively), thalamus (p &lt; 0.02; p &lt; 0.05, respectively), and cerebellum and brainstem (p &lt; 0.02), while only SPIO-Vol was significantly increased in the caudate/putamen (p &lt; 0.05). Both SUVR and SPIO-Vol values were positively significantly correlated with CS and among them in the same regions. TSPO/Iba1 and F4/80/Prussian blue staining immunohistochemistry suggests that increased activated microglia/macrophages underlay TSPO expression and SPIO uptake in symptomatic EAE mice. Conclusions: These preliminary results suggest that both activated microglia and infiltrated macrophages are present in vulnerable brain regions during the acute phase of PLP-EAE and contribute to disease severity. Both [<sup>18</sup>F]DPA-714-PET and SPIO-MRI appear suitable modalities for preclinical study of neuroinflammation in MS mice models. © 2020, The Author(s).</p>"
177,2-s2.0-85067685093,Psychiatric disorders in multiple sclerosis,"<p>Background: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is characterized by a large spectrum of symptoms, involving all functional systems. Psychiatric symptoms are common in people with MS (pwMS) having an important impact on quality of life and on some features of MS (fatigue, sleep, disability, adherence to disease-modifying drugs). The main psychiatric disturbances in MS are depressive, bipolar, anxiety, schizophrenic and obsessive–compulsive syndromes. Methods: Literature search for original articles and review in the databases, including PubMed and Scopus from 1959 to 2019. Results and conclusion: Studies answering the aim of this review were selected and reported. Epidemiological and clinical aspects of psychiatric syndromes (PS) in MS as well as self-report diagnostic scales and radiological correlates of PS in MS are described. Moreover, some radiological studies about primary psychiatric disorders (PD) are reported to underline how gray matter atrophy, white matter abnormalities and corpus callosum involvement in these diseases, as features in common with MS, may explain the more frequent occurrence of PD in MS than in the general population. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.</p>"

179,2-s2.0-85097677754,Neuroinflammation in the normal-appearing white matter (NAWM) of the multiple sclerosis brain causes abnormalities at the nodes of Ranvier,"<p>Changes to the structure of nodes of Ranvier in the normal-appearing white matter (NAWM) of multiple sclerosis (MS) brains are associated with chronic inflammation. We show that the paranodal domains in MS NAWM are longer on average than control, with Kv1.2 channels dislocated into the paranode. These pathological features are reproduced in a model of chronic meningeal inflammation generated by the injection of lentiviral vectors for the lymphotoxin-a (LTa) and interferon-? (IFN?) genes. We show that tumour necrosis factor (TNF), IFN?, and glutamate can provoke paranodal elongation in cerebellar slice cultures, which could be reversed by an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor blocker. When these changes were inserted into a computational model to simulate axonal conduction, a rapid decrease in velocity was observed, reaching conduction failure in small diameter axons. We suggest that glial cells activated by pro-inflammatory cytokines can produce high levels of glutamate, which triggers paranodal pathology, contributing to axonal damage and conduction deficits.

The clinical presentation is varied and non-specific, including symptoms of acute dementia, impaired consciousness, dysarthria, hemiparesis, pyramidal tract signs, seizure activity, ataxia and signs of interhemispheric disconnection. The differential diagnosis of MBD may include Wernicke's encephalopathy, multiple sclerosis, encephalitis, infectious or paraneoplastic leucoencephalopathy, infarction, Alzheimer's disease, multi-infarct dementia and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (Pick) disease. The diagnosis of MBD is dependent on MRI findings of hyperintensity of the corpus callosum on T2 and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery T2 sequences, with or without extracallosal lesions. The use of MRI in diagnosis has allowed for early initiation of treatment with parenteral thiamine, and improved the prognosis of MBD from frequently fatal to a mortality of less than 8%. Administration of thiamine within 14 days of symptom onset has demonstrated statistically better outcomes over delayed treatment. We present a case report of MBD diagnosed in a 72-year-old woman who presented with ataxia and slurred speech, in an effort to highlight the importance of obtaining MRI in patients presenting with behavioural disturbance and neurological findings, as well as discuss the relationship between thiamine supplementation and demyelinating diseases in the central nervous system. ©</p>"
181,2-s2.0-85097376161,Role of oligodendrocytes and myelin in the pathophysiology of autism spectrum disorder,"<p>Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is an early neurodevelopmental disorder that involves deficits in interpersonal communication, social interaction, and repetitive behaviors. Although ASD pathophysiology is still uncertain, alterations in the abnormal development of the frontal lobe, limbic areas, and putamen generate an imbalance between inhibition and excitation of neuronal activity. Interestingly, recent findings suggest that a disruption in neuronal connectivity is associated with neural alterations in white matter production and myelination in diverse brain regions of patients with ASD. This review is aimed to summarize the most recent evidence that supports the notion that abnormalities in the oligodendrocyte generation and axonal myelination in specific brain regions are involved in the pathophysiology of ASD. Fundamental molecular mediators of these pathological processes are also examined. Determining the role of alterations in oligodendrogenesis and myelination is a fundamental step to understand the pathophysiology of ASD and identify possible therapeutic targets. © 2020 by the authors.

182,2-s2.0-85096091655,Distinct oligodendrocyte populations have spatial preference and different responses to spinal cord injury,"<p>Mature oligodendrocytes (MOLs) show transcriptional heterogeneity, the functional consequences of which are unclear. MOL heterogeneity might correlate with the local environment or their interactions with different neuron types. Here, we show that distinct MOL populations have spatial preference in the mammalian central nervous system (CNS). We found that MOL type 2 (MOL2) is enriched in the spinal cord when compared to the brain, while MOL types 5 and 6 (MOL5/6) increase their contribution to the OL lineage with age in all analyzed regions. MOL2 and MOL5/6 also have distinct spatial preference in the spinal cord regions where motor and sensory tracts run. OL progenitor cells (OPCs) are not specified into distinct MOL populations during development, excluding a major contribution of OPC intrinsic mechanisms determining MOL heterogeneity. In disease, MOL2 and MOL5/6 present different susceptibility during the chronic phase following traumatic spinal cord injury. Our results demonstrate that the distinct MOL populations have different spatial preference and different responses to disease. © 2020, The Author(s).</p>"

Activation of microglia is involved in the pathogenesis of myelin loss. Objective: This study is focused on the role of Hv1 in regulating demyelination and microglial activation through reactive oxygen species (ROS) production after lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC)-mediated demyelination. We also explored autophagy in this process. Methods: A model of demyelination using two-point LPC injection into the corpus callosum was established. LFB staining, immunofluorescence, Western blot, and electron microscopy were used to study the severity of demyelination. Microglial phenotype and autophagy were detected by immunofluorescence and Western blot. Morris water maze was used to test spatial learning and memory ability. Results: We have identified that LPC-mediated myelin damage was reduced by Hv1 deficiency. Furthermore, we found that ROS and autophagy of microglia increased in the demyelination region, which was also inhibited by Hv1 knockout. Conclusion: These results suggested that microglial Hv1 deficiency ameliorates demyelination through inhibition of ROS-mediated autophagy and microglial phenotypic transformation. © 2020, The Author(s).</p>"
184,2-s2.0-85094677452,Anti-Axl antibody treatment reduces the severity of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis,"<p>Background: Multiple sclerosis is an immune-mediated disease of the central nervous system (CNS) characterized by inflammation, oligodendrocytes loss, demyelination, and damaged axons. Tyro3, Axl, and MerTK belong to a family of receptor tyrosine kinases that regulate innate immune responses and CNS homeostasis. During experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), the mRNA expression of MerTK, Gas6, and Axl significantly increase, whereas Tyro3 and ProS1 remain unchanged. We have shown that Gas6 is neuroprotective during EAE, and since Gas6 activation of Axl may be necessary for conferring neuroprotection, we sought to determine whether α-Axl or α-MerTK antibodies, shown by others to activate their respective receptors in vivo, could effectively reduce inflammation and neurodegeneration. Methods: Mice received either α-Axl, α-MerTK, IgG isotype control, or PBS before the onset of EAE symptoms. EAE clinical course, axonal damage, demyelination, cytokine production, and immune cell activation in the CNS were used to determine the severity of EAE. Results: α-Axl antibody treatment significantly decreased the EAE clinical indices of female mice during chronic EAE and of male mice during both acute and chronic phases. The number of days mice were severely paralyzed also significantly decreased with α-Axl treatment. Inflammatory macrophages/microglia and the extent of demyelination significantly decreased in the spinal cords of α-Axl-treated mice during chronic EAE, with no differences in the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. α-MerTK antibody did not influence EAE induction or progression. Conclusion: Our data suggests that the beneficial effect of Gas6/Axl signaling observed in mice administered with Gas6 can be partially preserved by administering an activating α-Axl antibody, but not α-MerTK. © 2020, The Author(s).</p>"

Methods and Results: Twenty-eight C57BL/6 mice were assigned into four groups as PBS, prophylaxis (P), treatment1 (T1) and treatment2 (T2). Prior to induction of EAE in prophylaxis group and on days 7 and 18 in T1 and T2 groups, respectively, Dicrocoelium eggs were injected intraperitoneally to each mouse. The clinical score, weight changes and incidence time of EAE were recorded. IFN-γ and IL-4 expression is quantified on spleen cells. Also, histopathological study by (H&amp;E) and Toluidine-Blue (TB), and Luxol Fast Blue (LFB) were performed. The data were analysed using SPSS version 21. Mean disease scores were significantly lower in P and T1 groups than the PBS group (P =.01). IFN-γ was lower in P and T1 groups than the PBS group. The highest level of IL-4 was observed in T1 group. The total number of neuroglia cells of corpus callosum was similar in all groups, but the density increased in T1 group compared to the PBS group (P =.03).

187,2-s2.0-85092636994,The role of glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta in multiple sclerosis,"<p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease of the central nervous system (CNS) that leads to progressive neurological disability due to axonal deterioration. Although MS presents profound heterogeneity in the clinical course, its underlying central mechanism is active demyelination and neurodegeneration associated with inflammation. Multiple autoimmune and neuroinflammatory pathways are involved in the demyelination process of MS. Analysis of MS lesions has shown that inflammatory genes are upregulated. Glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) is part of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family and has important roles in many signaling cascades. GSK-3 is a highly conserved serine/threonine protein kinase expressed in both the central and the peripheral nervous systems. GSK-3 modulates several biological processes through phosphorylation of protein kinases, including cell signaling, neuronal growth, apoptosis and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and interleukins, allowing adaptive changes in events such as cellular proliferation, migration, inflammation, and immunity. GSK-3 occurs in mammals in two isoforms GSK-3α and GSK-3β, both of which are common in the brain, although GSK-3α is found particularly in the cerebral cortex, cerebellum, striated hippocampus and Purkinje cells, while GSK-3β is found in all brain regions. In patients with chronic progressive MS, expression of GSK-3β is elevated in several brain regions such as the corpus callosum and cerebral cortex. GSK-3β inhibition may play a role in glial cell activation, reducing pathological pain induced by nerve injury by formalin injection. According to the role of GSK-3β in pathological conditions, the aim of this article is review of the role of GSK-3β in multiple sclerosis and inflammation of neurons. © 2020 The Authors</p>"
188,2-s2.0-85090886904,Comparative study between double inversion recovery (DIR) and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) MRI sequences for detection of cerebral lesions in multiple sclerosis,"<p>Background: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a common chronic inflammatory demyelinating disorder more common in young adults. MS is characterized mainly with white matter (WM) affection; however, considerable gray matter (GM) involvement is also noted in many patients. MRI is used for diagnosis and follow up of the disease using different pulse sequences; FLAIR imaging provides the highest sensitivity in the detection of supratentorial, juxtacortical, and the periventricular lesions but is less sensitive in the posterior fossa. A double inversion recovery (DIR) pulse sequence was recently introduced to improve the visibility of GM lesions and especially cortical lesions. The aim of this study is to assess the role of DIR sequence in the detection of brain lesions in patients with MS compared to FLAIR sequence. Results: DIR showed a significantly higher number of MS lesions in infratentorial region (2.9 ± 0.4 compared to 2.25 ± 0.3 in FLAIR) with a statistically significant difference (p = 0.002) and also in supratentorial periventricular regions (11.84 ± 8.07 in DIR and 11.31 ± 8.07 in FLAIR, p &lt; 0.001). DIR imaging also demonstrated significantly more intracortical lesions (7.12 ± 1.2 compared to 1.4 ± 0.9 in FLAIR imaging) with a statistically significant difference (p &lt; 0.001). On the other hand, corpus callosum lesions were significantly higher on FLAIR (0.84 ± 0.1) with respect to DIR imaging (0.68 ± 0.1) with a statistically significant difference in between (p = 0.025). Conclusion: DIR is a powerful conventional MRI sequence for visualization of brain lesions in patients with MS and is superior to FLAIR sequence in detecting lesions in different locations, namely cortical, periventricular, and infratentorial regions; hence, DIR can be added to the MRI protocol of MS patients or even can replace FLAIR which would be of a good diagnostic value with only 80 s added to the scan time. © 2020, The Author(s).</p>"
189,2-s2.0-85090167307,"Shikonin ameliorates experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) via immunomodulatory, anti-apoptotic and antioxidative activity","<p>Objectives: Multiple sclerosis is a common autoimmune inflammatory disease of the central nervous system. There are several underlying mechanisms for the pathogenesis of the disease, including inflammation, oligodendrocyte apoptosis and oxidative stress. Methods: The mechanism of action of shikonin was investigated in the C57BL/6 experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model of multiple sclerosis. Key findings: The results revealed that EAE induction significantly increased the extent of demyelination in the corpus callosum tissues of the animals, while treatment of the mice with shikonin significantly decreased the extent of demyelination. Real-time polymerase chain reaction-based analysis of the brain samples from the EAE mice revealed significant enhancement in the expression levels of tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interferon-γ (IFN-γ) and Bax genes as well as a reduction in the expression levels of transforming growth factor-ß (TGF-β) and Bcl2. But, shikonin treatment significantly reduced the expression levels of TNF-α, IFN-γ and Bax. On the other hand, the expression levels of TGF-β and Bcl2 as well as the activity of glutathione peroxidase-1 (GPX-1) enzyme were significantly increased following the shikonin treatment. Conclusions: This study emphasized the immune-modulatory and antioxidative effects of shikonin, which may have an important healing effect on the severity of EAE. © 2020 Royal Pharmaceutical Society</p>"
190,2-s2.0-85089980217,Hydroxychloroquine effects on miR-155-3p and miR-219 expression changes in animal model of multiple sclerosis,"<p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the central nervous system which causes chronic demyelination. Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) possess immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory properties. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of HCQ on miR-219 and miR-155-3p expression changes in MS-induced model. The animal model was induced by the administration of cuprizone containing food pellets (0.2%). Briefly, C57BL/6 mice were randomly divided into five groups. Group 1 received normal food and water during the study. Group 2 received cuprizone pellets for 5 weeks (demyelination phase) following one-week normal feeding during the remyelination phase. The remaining three groups received HCQ (2.5, 10 and 100 mg/kg) via drinking water during the demyelination phase. At the end of each phase, mice were deeply anesthetized, perfused with PBS through the heart, and their brains were removed. Brain sections stained with luxol fast blue and the images were analyzed. Also, the expression levels of miR-219 and miR-155-3p were evaluated by quantitative Real-Time PCR in all samples. HCQ decreased the expression of miR-155-3p and increased miR-219 expression in animals treated with 100 mg/kg of HCQ compared to the control group (p &lt; 0.0001) and the cuprizone group (p &lt; 0.0001). LFB method revealed a gradual increment of myelination in animals treated with 10 and 100 mg/kg of HCQ compared to the cuprizone group. Based on the obtained results of this study, HCQ can decrease microglial activity and increase oligodendrocye production by altering the expression of disease-associated miRNAs.

We show that Glutathione S-transferase 4α (Gsta4) is highly expressed during adult OL differentiation and that Gsta4 loss impairs differentiation into myelinating OLs in vitro. In addition, we identify Gsta4 as a target of both dimethyl fumarate, an existing MS therapy, and clemastine fumarate, a candidate remyelinating agent in MS. Overexpression of Gsta4 reduces expression of Fas and activity of the mitochondria-associated Casp8-Bid-axis in adult oligodendrocyte precursor cells, leading to improved OL survival during differentiation. The Gsta4 effect on apoptosis during adult OL differentiation was corroborated in vivo in both lysolecithin-induced demyelination and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis models, where Casp8 activity was reduced in Gsta4-overexpressing OLs. Our results identify Gsta4 as an intrinsic regulator of OL differentiation, survival and remyelination, as well as a potential target for future reparative MS therapies. © 2020, The Author(s).</p>"

We evaluated the MRI features of clinically definite MS subjects with and without CSF-OCB. Relapsing MS subjects were recruited from a prospective registry in a university center. CSF-OCB were detected using isoelectric focusing and lgG-specific immunofixation. MRI metrics including brain volumes, lesion volumes and microstructural measures, were analyzed by FMRIB Software Library (FSL) and Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM). Seventy-five subjects with relapsing MS were analyzed. Forty-four (59%) subjects had an interval MRI at around 1 year. CSF-OCB were detected in 46 (61%) subjects. The OCB-positive group had a higher proportion of cerebellar lesions than the OCB-negative group (23.9% vs. 3.4%, p = 0.057). Except for amygdala volumes which were lower in the OCB-positive group (p = 0.034), other regional brain volumes including the subcortical deep gray matter and corpus callosum were similar. The two groups also showed comparable brain atrophy rate. For DTI, the OCB-positive group showed significantly higher mean diffusivity (MD) value in perilesional normal-appearing white matter (p = 0.043). Relapsing MS patients with and without CSF-OCB shared similar MRI features regarding volumetric analyses and DTI microstructural integrity. © 2020, The Author(s).</p>"

194,2-s2.0-85087653157,A time-dependent diffusion MRI signature of axon caliber variations and beading,"<p>MRI provides a unique non-invasive window into the brain, yet is limited to millimeter resolution, orders of magnitude coarser than cell dimensions. Here, we show that diffusion MRI is sensitive to the micrometer-scale variations in axon caliber or pathological beading, by identifying a signature power-law diffusion time-dependence of the along-fiber diffusion coefficient. We observe this signature in human brain white matter and identify its origins by Monte Carlo simulations in realistic substrates from 3-dimensional electron microscopy of mouse corpus callosum. Simulations reveal that the time-dependence originates from axon caliber variation, rather than from mitochondria or axonal undulations. We report a decreased amplitude of time-dependence in multiple sclerosis lesions, illustrating the potential sensitivity of our method to axonal beading in a plethora of neurodegenerative disorders. This specificity to microstructure offers an exciting possibility of bridging across scales to image cellular-level pathology with a clinically feasible MRI technique. © 2020, The Author(s).</p>"
195,2-s2.0-85087423145,Cognitive impairment in benign multiple sclerosis: a multiparametric structural and functional MRI study,"<p>Introduction: The substrates of cognitive impairment in benign MS (BMS) still need to be identified. We investigated whether cognitive impairment in BMS patients is associated with specific patterns of brain structural and functional abnormalities. Methods: Thirty-seven BMS patients (EDSS score ≤ 3.0 and disease duration ≥ 15 years) and 50 healthy controls (HC) were studied. In BMS patients, a cognitive impairment index (CII) was derived. Gray matter (GM) volumes, white matter (WM) fractional anisotropy (FA) and resting-state (RS) functional connectivity (FC) were investigated for whole-brain relevant regions (cortex, lobes, subcortical nuclei, fiber tracts) and functional networks. Univariate and multivariate analyses identified independent predictors of cognitive impairment. Results: In BMS, median CII was 9 (IQR: 4–16). Compared to HC, BMS patients showed reduced WM FA, GM atrophy and increased RS FC in fronto-temporo-parietal regions. At multivariate analysis, percentage of T2-lesions of the corpus callosum, reduced posterior corona radiata (PCR) FA and caudate nucleus atrophy were independent predictors of worse CII. A multivariate model identified reduced PCR FA (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.39; p = 0.001) as the only predictor of CII. Conclusions: Cognitive impairment in BMS is associated with structural damage of relevant brain areas. WM damage of parietal regions was the predominant predictor of worse cognitive performance in these patients. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.</p>"
196,2-s2.0-85085329609,Reciprocal Influences of HIV and Cannabinoids on the Brain and Cognitive Function,"<p>Globally, cannabis is the most commonly used illicit drug, with disproportionately high use among persons with HIV. Despite advances in HIV care, nearly half of persons living with HIV continue to experience neurocognitive deficits or impairments that may have negative impacts on their daily function. Chronic cannabis use may play a role in the development or exacerbation of these impairments. Here we present a review summarizing existing research detailing the effect of cannabis use associated with the neuropathogenesis of HIV. We examine evidence for possible additive or synergistic effects of HIV infection and cannabis use on neuroHIV in both the preclinical and adult human literatures, including in vitro studies, animal models, clinical neuroimaging research, and studies examining the cognitive effects of cannabis. We discuss the limitations of existing research, including methodological challenges involved with clinical research with human subjects. We identify gaps in the field and propose critical research questions to advance our understanding of how cannabis use affects neuroHIV.

197,2-s2.0-85081974371,Fatigue in multiple sclerosis: Does the functional or structural damage prevail?,"<p>Fatigue in multiple sclerosis (MS) is a highly invalidating symptom, lacking efficacious drugs. This topical review aims at assessing the signs in the literature of functional versus structural damage prevalence at the origin of MS fatigue by focusing on papers that assessed the two counterparts in the same patients, paying attention that the fatigue levels do not correlate with clinical severity. We summarize and discuss evidence of increased levels of fatigue occurring together with the alterations of functional connectivity at multiple levels, in the absence of any relationship with lesion load and local atrophy of the involved structures. Specifically, neuronal communication mainly altered in the corticomuscular synchronizations, between hemispheric homologs and in the resting-state networks involved in emotion (cingulate cortex) and effort-reward balance (striatum and inferior parietal lobule). Finally, given the functional prevalence in neuronal network alterations at the origin of fatigue in MS, we highlight the relevance of developing treatments aiming at compensating the neuronal electric communication dysfunctions. © The Author(s), 2020.</p>"

Interestingly, the endocannabinoid system has been reported to confer neuroprotection against demyelination. The present study aims to assess the effects of the cannabinoid agonist WIN-55,212-2 in cuprizone fed animals on myelin repair capacity. Animals exposed to cuprizone were simultaneously treated withWIN-55,212-2, behaviorally tested and finally the corpus callosum was exhaustively studied by Western blotting, qRT-PCR and a myelin staining procedure. We report that the long-term administration of WIN-55,212-2 reduced the global amount of CB<sub>1</sub> protein. Histological analysis revealed clear demyelination after being fed cuprizone for three weeks. However, cuprizone-fed mice subjected to 0.5 mg/Kg of WIN-55,212-2 displayed no differences when compared to controls during demyelination, although there was a robust increase in the myelinated axons during the remyelination phase. These animals displayed better performance on contextual fear conditioning which was in turn non-attributable to an antinociceptive effect. In contrast, a 1 mg/Kg dosage caused a remarkable demyelination accompanied by limited potential for myelin repair. Upon drug administration while mice ongoing demyeliniation, the expression of Aif1 (microglia) and Gfap (astrocytes) followed a dose-dependent manner whereas the expression of both markers was apparently attenuated during remyelination. Treatment with vehicle or 0.5 mg/Kg of the drug during demyelination increased the expression of Pdgfra (oligodendrocyte precursor cells) but this did not occur when 1 mg/Kg was administered. In conclusion, the drug at 0.5 mg/Kg did not alter myelin architecture while 1 mg/Kg had a deleterious effect in this model. © 2020, The Author(s).</p>"
199,2-s2.0-85096752450,Ferroptosis mediates cuprizone-induced loss of oligodendrocytes and demyelination,"<p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic demyelinating disease of the CNS. Cuprizone (CZ), a copper chelator, is widely used to study demyelination and remyelination in the CNS, in the context of MS. However, the mechanisms underlying oligodendrocyte (OL) cell loss and demyelination are not known. As copper-containing enzymes play important roles in iron homeostasis and controlling oxidative stress, we examined whether chelating copper leads to disruption of molecules involved in iron homeostasis that can trigger iron-mediated OL loss. We show that giving mice (male) CZ in the diet induces rapid loss of OL in the corpus callosum by 2 d, accompanied by expression of several markers for ferroptosis, a relatively newly described form of iron-mediated cell death. In ferroptosis, iron-mediated free radicals trigger lipid peroxidation under conditions of glutathione insufficiency, and a reduced capacity to repair lipid damage. This was further confirmed using a small-molecule inhibitor of ferroptosis that prevents CZ-induced loss of OL and demyelination, providing clear evidence of a copper-iron connection in CZ-induced neurotoxicity. This work has wider implications for disorders, such as multiple sclerosis and CNS injury. Copyright © 2020 the authors</p>"
200,2-s2.0-85096780029,Low-Density Lipoprotein Receptor-Related Protein 1 (LRP1) Is a Negative Regulator of Oligodendrocyte Progenitor Cell Differentiation in the Adult Mouse Brain,"<p>Low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) is a large, endocytic cell surface receptor that is highly expressed by oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) and LRP1 expression is rapidly downregulated as OPCs differentiate into oligodendrocytes (OLs). We report that the conditional deletion of Lrp1 from adult mouse OPCs (Pdgfrα-CreER :: Lrp1<sup>fl/fl</sup>) increases the number of newborn, mature myelinating OLs added to the corpus callosum and motor cortex. As these additional OLs extend a normal number of internodes that are of a normal length, Lrp1-deletion increases adult myelination. OPC proliferation is also elevated following Lrp1 deletion in vivo, however, this may be a secondary, homeostatic response to increased OPC differentiation, as our in vitro experiments show that LRP1 is a direct negative regulator of OPC differentiation, not proliferation. Deleting Lrp1 from adult OPCs also increases the number of newborn mature OLs added to the corpus callosum in response to cuprizone-induced demyelination. These data suggest that the selective blockade of LRP1 function on adult OPCs may enhance myelin repair in demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis. © Copyright © 2020 Auderset, Pitman, Cullen, Pepper, Taylor, Foa and Young.</p>"
201,2-s2.0-85097291813,Evaluation of neuroprotective effects of alpha-tocopherol in cuprizone-induced demyelination model of multiple sclerosis,"<p>Background and Purpose: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disorder characterized by demyelination and axonal loss. Quantitative estimation of behavioral, locomotor, and histological changes following the use of alpha-tocopherol (AT) in the animal model of MS have not been reported. The present study was planned to evaluate whether AT can improve sensorimotor dysfunction and reduce demyelination in the cuprizone (CPZ)-induced rat model of MS. Experimental approach: Female Sprague-Dawley rats (8 weeks) were fed with cuprizone diet for 5 weeks followed by intraperitoneal injections of alpha-tocopherol (100 mg/Kg) or PBS for 2 weeks (groups E1 and E2, n = 8). Group C (n = 8) was fed with normal pellets followed by intraperitoneal doses of PBS. Open-field test and beam walking were carried out on every 10<sup>th</sup>day. The mean area of demyelination in the corpus callosum was quantified in Luxol<sup>®</sup>fast blue (LFB) stained histological sections of the forebrain. Qualitative grading for relative changes in the stains of myelinated fibers was also done. Findings/Results: During withdrawal of CPZ, AT treatment increased the average speed by 22% in group E1, compared to group E2 (P &lt; 0.05). The mean time to walk the beam was reduced in group E1 by 2.6% compared to group E2 (P &lt; 0.05). The rearing frequency was increased in group E1 during week 6-7 compared to that in the period of CPZ treatment. The mean area of demyelination in the corpus callosum showed a 12% reduction in group E1 compared to group E2 (P &lt; 0.05). Conclusion and implications: Short-term AT therapy showed improvement in motor dysfunction and reduction of demyelination in the animal model of MS. © 2020 Wolters Kluwer Medknow Publications.

202,2-s2.0-85095842988,Combining magnetization transfer ratio mri and quantitative measures of walking improves the identification of fallers in MS,"<p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) impacts balance and walking function, resulting in accidental falls. History of falls and clinical assessment are commonly used for fall prediction, yet these measures have limited predictive validity. Falls are multifactorial; consideration of disease-specific pathology may be critical for improving fall prediction in MS. The objective of this study was to examine the predictive value of clinical measures (i.e., walking, strength, sensation) and corticospinal tract (CST) MRI measures, both discretely and combined, to fall status in MS. Twenty-nine individuals with relapsing-remitting MS (mean ± SD age: 48.7 ± 11.5 years; 17 females; Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS): 4.0 (range 1–6.5); symptom duration: 11.9 ± 8.7 years; 14 fallers) participated in a 3T brain MRI including diffusion tensor imaging and magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) and clinical tests of walking, strength, sensation and falls history. Clinical measures of walking were significantly associated with CST fractional anisotropy and MTR. A model including CST MTR, walk velocity and vibration sensation explained &gt;31% of the variance in fall status (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.3181) and accurately distinguished 73.8% fallers, which was superior to stand-alone models that included only MRI or clinical measures. This study advances the field by combining clinical and MRI measures to improve fall prediction accuracy in MS. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.</p>"
203,2-s2.0-85091232681,“A case report: Co-occurrence of cerebral amyloid angiopathy and multiple sclerosis”,"<p>Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is a chronic pathological condition characterized by progressive accumulation of amyloid protein in the wall of cerebral blood vessels, both leptomeningeal and cortical. That may result in the development of such conditions as microaneurysms, hemorrhagic, ischaemic brain injury and contribute to cognitive impairment. We herein report a case of Iowa-type hereditary cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) mutation diagnosed with MS. The family of the reported patient had performed genetic testing due to the history of intracerebral hemorrhage. Sequence analysis of exon 17 of the APP gene showed the presence of the D694N g.275272 G &gt; A (c.2080 G &gt; A) mutation, which caused the substitution of aspartate for aspargine at position 694 of APP. Alike the discussed patient, this mutation has been found in other family members in an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. Contrary to the rest of the family, the reported patient has been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis based on McDonald criteria. Recent studies shed light on the possible link between the APP accumulation and MS progression. It has been indicated that amyloid can prove a vital role in neuroimmunology, whereas the accumulation of APP in the CNS has been suggested to be a potential biomarker for the progression of MS. Moreover, the amyloid positron-emission tomography (amyloid-PET) has been demonstrated to serve as a diagnostic tool for establishing the degree of demyelination and remyelination in MS. Even though, one swallow does not make a summer, this finding would be another step forward in the understanding of pathological processes underlying the pathogenesis of MS. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.</p>"

Procedures: Using a pre-clinical 7 T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) system, CEST imaging was applied to a toxin (lysophosphatidylcholine; LPC) induced rat (MS<sub>LPC</sub>) and control (CTRL) groups to compare in vivo glutamate signal changes. The GluCEST-weighted signals were analyzed based on the magnetization transfer ratio asymmetry approach at 3.0 ppm on the region-of-interests (ROIs) in the corpus callosum and hippocampus at each hemispheric region. Results: GluCEST-weighted signals were significantly changed between the CTRL and MS<sub>LPC</sub> groups, while higher glutamate signals were indicated in the MS<sub>LPC</sub> than the CTRL group ([MS<sub>LPC</sub> / CTRL]; hippocampus: [6.159 ± 0.790 / 4.336 ± 0.446] and corpus callosum: [-3.545 ± 0.945 / -6.038 ± 0.620], all p = 0.001). Conclusions: Our results show increased GluCEST-weighted signals in the LPC-induced demyelination rat brain compared with control.

Methods: 270 NMOSD patients were recruited from seven centers. The brain MRI were classified as normal, NMOSD-specific lesions, multiple sclerosis-like, nonspecific white matter changes. Brain volumes including whole brain, white, gray matter, cortex and subcortex gray matter volume were measured. The relationship between MRI measures, clinical disability and cognitive impairment were investigated. Results: 98 patients (36.3%) had normal brain MRI; 48 patients (17.7%) had NMOSD-specific lesions located in dorsal brainstem, corticospinal tract corpus, callosum and periependymal lesions surrounding the ventricular system; 16 patients (6%) had multiple sclerosis-like lesions; and 108 patients (40%) had nonspecific white matter changes. NMOSD patients with brain lesions had a trend of lower subcortex gray matter volume compared to patients without lesions. 52.5% patients with normal brain MRI and 50.8% patients with abnormal brain MRI showed cognitive impairment. No significant differences were identified in brain volume between cognitive impairment and cognitive preserved groups. Conclusion: In this large multicenter NMOSD cohort, nonspecific white matter changes were the most common findings (40%). NMOSD patients with brain lesions demonstrated a trend of having lower brain volume than patients without lesions. Approximately 50% NMOSD patients presented cognitive impairment independent of brain lesions. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.</p>"
206,2-s2.0-85089518229,Genetically Confirmed CARASIL: Case Report with Novel HTRA1 Mutation and Literature Review,"<p>Background: Cerebral autosomal recessive arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CARASIL) is an extremely rare monogenic autosomal disease associated with the HtrA serine protease 1 (HTRA 1) gene mutation. Recently, a few genetically confirmed CARASIL cases with novel HTRA1 mutations have been reported in countries other than Japan. Case Description: Here, we report a case of a patient presenting with worsening right hemiplegia and hemiparesthesia. Physical examination revealed that the patient had typical clinical features of CARASIL including thinning hair, cognitive impairment, emotional changes, lumbago, and gait disorder. Brain magnetic resonance imaging showed abnormal diffuse symmetric changes in white matter and hypertensive diffusion-weighted imaging signals in the left centrum ovale and right splenium of the corpus callosum, and susceptibility-weighted imaging showed multiple cerebral microbleeds. Lumbar magnetic resonance imaging showed herniated disks with degenerative changes. A genetic test showed a novel homozygous nucleotide variation of c.847G&gt;T in the HTRA1 gene, thereby resulting in p.Gly283Ter. Thus the patient met the diagnostic criteria for CARASIL. We provide a literature review of genetically confirmed CARASIL cases reported to date. Conclusions: CARASIL is a rare autosomal recessive disease with an HTRA1 mutation. Familiarity with the early clinical and imaging features of CARASIL combined with a genetic test is key for its early diagnosis. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.</p>"

Nowadays, increasing scientific reports have focused on neurodegenerative processes and structural changes of the disease underlying pathogenesis. Aim: The aim of this study is a structural analysis of brain magnetic resonance images (MRIs) in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) comparing with normal individuals. Methods: This case-control study was carried out on MRIs of 20 patients with RRMS and 20 healthy controls in Zahedan, Iran. MR images with 4-mm slice thickness and 0.5-mm intervals in three anatomical planes (coronal, sagittal, axial) were acquired. Then, stereological parameters, including volume and volume density of different parts of the brain, based on Cavalries’ point counting method were measured in both groups. Data analyses were performed using Mann-Whitney U and Pearson’s correlation tests. Results: The results of the study showed that there were no significant differences in total brain, hemispheres, gray matter, and basal nuclei volume and volume density between the two groups (p ˃ 0.05). However, the left hemisphere, cerebellum, lateral ventricles, brainstem, corpus callosum, and white matter volume in RRMS patients were significantly lower than those in controls (p ˂ 0.05). Conclusion: The findings showed that quantitative assessments based on stereological method on brain MRIs facilitate clarifying neuropathology of the disease. Also, it can be helpful as a simple index for following up the clinical situation and assessing therapeutic efficiency in MS patients. It may provide a precise treatment approach and justification of symptoms in patients with MS. © 2020, Royal Academy of Medicine in Ireland.</p>"
208,2-s2.0-85094983000,Recommendations of the polish medical society of radiology and the polish society of neurology for a protocol concerning routinely used magnetic resonance imaging in patients with multiple sclerosis,"<p>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a widely used method for the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis that is essential for the detection and follow-up of the disease. Objective. The Polish Medical Society of Radiology (PLTR) and the Polish Society of Neurology (PTN) present the second version of their recommendations for investigations routinely conducted in magnetic resonance imaging departments in patients with multiple sclerosis. This version includes new data and practical comments for electroradiology technologists and radiologists. The recommended protocol aims to improve the MRI procedure and, most importantly, to standardise the method of conducting scans in all MRI departments. This is crucial for the initial diagnostics necessary for establishing a diagnosis, as well as for MS patient monitoring, which directly translates into significant clinical decisions. Introduction. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic immune mediated inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS), the aetiology of which is still unknown. The nature of the disease lies in a CNS destruction process disseminated in time (DIT) and space (DIS). MRI detects focal lesions in the white and grey matter with high sensitivity (although with significantly lower specificity in the latter). It is also the best tool to assess brain atrophy in patients with MS in terms of grey matter volume (GMV) and white matter volume (WMV) as well as local atrophy (by measuring the volume of thalamus, corpus callosum, subcortical nuclei, and hippocampus) as parameters that correlate with disability progression and cognitive dysfunctions. Progress in MR techniques, as well as advances in postprocessing the obtained data, has driven the dynamic development of computer programs that allow for a more repeatable assessment of brain atrophy in both cross-sectional and longitudinal studies. MR imaging is unquestionably the best diagnostic tool available to follow up the course of the disease and support clinicians in choosing the most appropriate treatment strategy for their MS patient. However, to diagnose and follow up MS patients on the basis of MRI in accordance with the latest standards, the MRI study must adhere to certain quality criteria. Such criteria are the subject of this paper. © 2020 Urban and Partner. All rights reserved.</p>"
209,2-s2.0-85086412821,CD44 expression in the cuprizone model,"<p>Numerous studies report that changes in extracellular matrix components and receptors, such as CD44, contribute to immune cell recruitment and thus lesion formation in multiple sclerosis (MS). In the present study, we used the cuprizone model to elucidate the expression pattern of CD44 in a toxin-induced MS model. Therefore, tissues of cuprizone-intoxicated mice were analyzed by real-time qRT-PCR and immunohistochemical staining against CD44. Co-localization analyses of CD44-positive cells with glial cell markers were performed by immunofluorescence labeling and in-situ hybridization. To investigate the functional importance of CD44 expression for myelination and glial cell activation, Cd44-deficient mice were used. In this study we demonstrate that CD44 expression is induced in a time-dependent manner in an autoimmune-independent model of MS. Up-regulation of CD44 expression was primarily associated to the superficial and perivascular glia limitans and demyelinated white matter structures, particularly the corpus callosum. In the demyelinated corpus callosum, CD44 was localized on GFAP<sup>+</sup> astrocytes and IBA1<sup>+</sup> microglial cells. Despite a robust expression induction, Cd44-deficiency did not ameliorate cuprizone-induced pathology. Although further studies will be needed to examine the functional relevance of CD44 in the cuprizone model, the spatial and temporal expression pattern of CD44 will pave the way to evaluate its precise role in different (immune and non-immune) pathological conditions. © 2020</p>"

We present a case presenting with characteristic features of HaNDL and an MRI lesion in the splenium of corpus callosum. CSF neurofilament light chain (NFL) levels were assessed in this patient together with 7 additional HaNDL patients, 18 multiple sclerosis (MS) patients, and 15 primary headache patients. Both HaNDL and primary headache patients showed significantly lower NFL levels than MS patients. Our results suggest that increased CSF levels of NFL and neuroaxonal loss are not characteristic features of HaNDL. Neurological disorders mimicking HaNDL often present with increased levels of NFL, and thus CSF measurement of NFL might be useful in differential diagnosis of HaNDL. © 2020</p>"

We conducted a retrospective study of intracranial signal changes on monthly triple-dose contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examinations from the previously published Betaseron vs. Copaxone in Multiple Sclerosis With Triple-Dose Gadolinium and 3-Tesla MRI Endpoints Trial (N = 67) to characterize the dynamics of gadolinium deposition in several deep brain nuclei and track persistence versus washout of gadolinium deposition on long-term follow-up (LTFU) examinations (N = 28) obtained approximately 10 years after enrollment in the Betaseron vs. Copaxone in Multiple Sclerosis With Triple-Dose Gadolinium and 3-Tesla MRI Endpoints Trial. Materials and Methods Using T2 and proton density images and using image analysis software (ITK-SNAP), manual regions of interest were created ascribing boundaries of the caudate nucleus, dentate nucleus, globus pallidus, pulvinar, putamen, white matter, and air. Intensity analysis was conducted on T1-weighted fat-saturated (fat-sat) images using the FSL package. A linear rigid-body transform was calculated from the fat-sat image at each target time point to the region of interest segmentation reference time point fat-sat image. Serial MRI signal was analyzed using linear mixed regression modeling with random intercept. Annual MRI signal changes including LTFU scans were assessed with t test. Results During monthly scanning, all gray matter structures demonstrated a significant (P &lt; 0.0001) increase in contrast-to-noise ratio. Yearly changes in deposition showed distinctive patterns for the specific nucleus: globus pallidus showed complete retention, pulvinar showed partial washout, while dentate, caudate, and putamen returned to baseline (ie, complete washout). Conclusions Monthly increased contrast-to-noise ratio in gray matter nuclei is consistent with gadolinium deposition over time. The study also suggests that some deep gray matter nuclei permanently retain gadolinium, whereas others demonstrate washout of soluble gadolinium. © Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

212,2-s2.0-85087726201,Measurements of the corpus callosum index and fractional anisotropy of the corpus callosum and their cutoff values are useful to assess global brain volume loss in multiple sclerosis,"<p>Objectives: Recent studies suggest that parameters of the corpus callosum (CC), such as the CC index (CCI) and fractional anisotropy (FA) of the CC, may be related to the degree of brain volume loss (BVL) in MS patients; however, cutoff values that determine the degree of BVL have not been set. Methods: Seventy-five MS patients and 21 healthy controls (HCs) underwent volumetric MRI examinations. MS patients were also evaluated for T2 lesion load, the CCI, and FA of the CC. Among the 75 MS patients, 20 had undergone cognitive assessments with the Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT). After 75 MS patients were categorized into mild, moderate, or severe BVL subgroups according to our previous report, we performed receiver operating characteristic analysis to determine the cutoff values of CCI and FA, categorizing the MS patients into the three subgroups. Results: The volume of the CC was significantly reduced in MS patients compared to that in HCs. The CCI and FA were significantly associated with EDSS, disease duration, clinical phenotype, T2-lesion load, and whole brain volume. The FA was significantly correlated with the SDMT score. We identified optimal cutoff values for the CCI and FA of 0.32 (85% sensitivity, 92% specificity) and 0.39 (100% sensitivity, 92% specificity), respectively, which discriminated the severe BVL group from others, and 0.385 (84% sensitivity, 74% specificity) and 0.45 (81% sensitivity, 89% specificity), respectively, which discriminated the mild BVL group from others. Conclusion: The CCI and FA cutoff values may be useful for evaluating the degree of MS brain atrophy in clinical practice. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.</p>"

Calorie restriction (CR) is a dietary manipulation to reduce calorie intake which has been shown to improve neuroprotection and attenuate neurodegenerative disorders. Here, we evaluated the effect of 33% CR regimen for 4 weeks on the remyelination capacity of Cuprizone (CPZ) induced demyelination in a mouse model of MS. Results showed that CR induced a significant increase in motor coordination and balance performance in CPZ mice. Also, luxol fast blue (LFB) staining showed that CR regimen significantly improved the remyelination in the corpus callosum of CPZ + CR mice compared to the CPZ group. In addition, CR regimen significantly increased the transcript expression levels of BDNF, Sox2, and Sirt1 in the corpus callosum of CPZ mice, while decreasing the p53 levels. Moreover, CR regimen significantly decreased the apoptosis rate. Furthermore, astrogliosis (GFAP + astrocytes) and microgliosis (Iba-1 + microglia) were significantly decreased by CR regimen while oligodendrogenesis (Olig2+) and Sirt1 + cell expression were significantly increased in the corpus callosum of CPZ + CR mice compared to the CPZ group. In conclusion, CR regimen can promote remyelination potential in a CPZ-demyelinating mouse model of MS by increasing oligodendrocyte generation while decreasing their apoptosis. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.</p>"
214,2-s2.0-85081750473,In vivo silencing of miR-125a-3p promotes myelin repair in models of white matter demyelination,"<p>In the last decade, microRNAs have been increasingly recognized as key modulators of glial development. Recently, we identified miR-125a-3p as a new player in oligodendrocyte physiology, regulating in vitro differentiation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs). Here, we show that miR-125a-3p is upregulated in active lesions of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients and in OPCs isolated from the spinal cord of chronic experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mice, but not in those isolated from the spontaneously remyelinating corpus callosum of lysolecithin-treated mice. To test whether a sustained expression of miR-125a-3p in OPCs contribute to defective remyelination, we modulated miR-125a-3p expression in vivo and ex vivo after lysolecithin-induced demyelination. We found that lentiviral over-expression of miR-125a-3p impaired OPC maturation, whereas its downregulation accelerated remyelination. Transcriptome analysis and luciferase reporter assay revealed that these effects are partly mediated by the direct interaction of miR-125a-3p with Slc8a3, a sodium–calcium membrane transporter, and identified novel candidate targets, such as Gas7, that we demonstrated necessary to correctly address oligodendrocytes to terminal maturation. These findings show that miR-125a-3p upregulation negatively affects OPC maturation in vivo, suggest its role in the pathogenesis of demyelinating diseases and unveil new targets for future promyelinating protective interventions. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p>"
215,2-s2.0-85070317649,Infratentorial and spinal cord lesions: Cumulative predictors of long-term disability?,"<p>Objective: The objective of the study was to determine whether early infratentorial and/or spinal cord lesions are long-term cumulative predictors of disability progression in multiple sclerosis (MS). Methods: We selected 153 MS patients from the longitudinal Amsterdam MS cohort. Lesion analysis was performed at baseline and year 2. Disability progression after 6 and 11 years was measured using the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) and EDSS-plus (including 25-foot walk and 9-hole peg test). Patients with spinal cord or infratentorial lesions were compared for the risk of 6- and 11-year disability progression to patients without spinal cord or infratentorial lesions, respectively. Subsequently, patients with lesions on both locations were compared to patients with only spinal cord or only infratentorial lesions. Results: Baseline spinal cord lesions show a higher risk of 6-year EDSS progression (odds ratio (OR): 3.6, p = 0.007) and EDSS-plus progression (OR: 2.5, p = 0.028) and 11-year EDSS progression (OR: 2.8, p = 0.047). Patients with both infratentorial and spinal cord lesions did not have a higher risk of 6-year disability progression than patients with only infratentorial or only spinal cord lesions. Conclusion: The presence of early spinal cord lesions seems to be a dominant risk factor of disability progression. Simultaneous presence of early infratentorial and spinal cord lesions did not undisputedly predict disability progression. © The Author(s), 2019.</p>"
216,2-s2.0-85040065589,Does restricted diffusion in the splenium indicate an acute infarct?,"<p>Objective: Although splenial lesions are rare, they are frequently associated with ischemic infarcts, antiepileptic drug toxicity or abrupt discontinuation, viral encephalitis, and metabolic disturbances. In this study, we evaluated clinical and imaging findings and aetiology in 16 patients with splenium lesions. Methods: Between 2013 and 2017, patients with splenium lesions were examined. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed using a 1.5-T unit with fluid attenuation inversion recovery sequences. Additionally, diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps were examined. Results: The patients were 11 males and 5 females; the mean age was 52.3 ± 20.3 (22–87) years. The patients were admitted with the following conditions: consciousness disorder (n = 7, 43.7%), headache (n = 3, 18.7%), seizure (n = 3, 18.7%), ataxia (n = 3, 18.7%), hemiparesis (n = 4, 25%), meaningless speech (n = 2, 12.5%), fever (n = 3, 18.7%), perioral numbness (n = 1, 6.2%), and diplopia (n = 1, 6.2%). Hyperintensity in the splenium was observed in DWI sequences in all patients on MRI. Fourteen patients (87.5%) showed hypointensity in the same region on ADC. In patients with ischemic infarcts, the splenium lesions were most commonly observed in the area of the posterior cerebral artery (n = 4, 25%). MRI showed splenial signal changes in DWI sequences in all patients. Hyperintensity in the splenium was observed in DWI sequences in all patients on MRI. Fourteen patients (87.5%) showed hypointensity in the same region on ADC. The aetiologies were defined as multiple sclerosis (n = 1, 6.2%), ischemic infarction (n = 4, 25%), tuberculous meningitis (n = 3, 18.7%), viral encephalitis (n = 2, 12.5%), hypernatremia (n = 1, 6.2%), brain tumour (n = 1, 6.2%), Marchiafava-Bignami syndrome (n = 1, 6.2%), head trauma (n = 1, 6.2%), substance use (n = 1, 6.2%), and epilepsy (n = 1, 6.2%). Conclusion: Not every diffuse restriction observed on MRI indicates an ischemic stroke. Although radiologic images of the splenium may suggest acute ischemic infarction, the actual cause may be another pathology. Therefore, the symptoms and aetiologies of patients with splenium lesions should be considered and investigated from a wide range of perspectives. © 2018, Belgian Neurological Society.</p>"
217,2-s2.0-85092737711,Revisiting the Pathoetiology of Multiple Sclerosis: Has the Tail Been Wagging the Mouse?,"<p>Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is traditionally considered an autoimmune-mediated demyelinating disease, the pathoetiology of which is unknown. However, the key question remains whether autoimmunity is the initiator of the disease (outside-in) or the consequence of a slow and as yet uncharacterized cytodegeneration (oligodendrocytosis), which leads to a subsequent immune response (inside-out). Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis has been used to model the later stages of MS during which the autoimmune involvement predominates. In contrast, the cuprizone (CPZ) model is used to model early stages of the disease during which oligodendrocytosis and demyelination predominate and are hypothesized to precede subsequent immune involvement in MS. Recent studies combining a boost, or protection, to the immune system with disruption of the blood brain barrier have shown CPZ-induced oligodendrocytosis with a subsequent immune response. In this Perspective, we review these recent advances and discuss the likelihood of an inside-out vs. an outside-in pathoetiology of MS. © Copyright © 2020 Sen, Almuslehi, Shortland, Coorssen and Mahns.</p>"
218,2-s2.0-85090251433,Inhibition of RhoA/ROCK pathway in the early stage of hypoxia ameliorates depression in mice via protecting myelin sheath,"<p>Neuroplasticity and connectivity in the central nervous system (CNS) are easily damaged after hypoxia. Long-term exposure to an anoxic environment can lead to neuropsychiatric symptoms and increases the likelihood of depression. Demyelination is an important lesion of CNS injury that may occur in depression. Previous studies have found that the RhoA/ROCK pathway is upregulated in neuropsychiatric disorders such as multiple sclerosis, stroke, and neurodegenerative diseases. Therefore, the chief aim of this study is to explore the regulatory role of the RhoA/ROCK pathway in the development of depression after hypoxia by behavioral tests, Western blotting, immunostaining as well as electron microscopy. Results showed that HIF-1α, S100β, RhoA/ROCK, and immobility time in FST were increased, sucrose water preference ratio in SPT was decreased, and the aberrant activity of neurocyte and demyelination occurred after hypoxia. After the administration of Y-27632 and fluoxetine in hypoxia, these alterations were improved. Lingo1, a negative regulatory factor, was also overexpressed after hypoxia and its expression was decreased when the pathway blocked. However, fluoxetine had no effect on the expression of Lingo1. Then, we demonstrated that demyelination was associated with failures of oligodendrocyte precursor cell proliferation and differentiation and increased apoptosis of oligodendrocytes. Collectively, our data indicate that the RhoA/ROCK pathway plays a vital role in the initial depression during hypoxia. Blocking this pathway in the early stage of hypoxia can enhance the effectiveness of antidepressants, rescue myelin damage, and reduce the expression of the negative regulatory protein of myelination. The findings provide new insight into the prophylaxis and treatment of depression. Copyright © 2020 American Chemical Society.</p>"
219,2-s2.0-85086871503,Theory of mind network in multiple Sclerosis: A double disconnection mechanism,"<p>The relationship between cognitive and affective theory of mind (ToM), clinical variables, and brain tissue injury is still a subject of debate in multiple sclerosis (MS). By adopting a ToM Networks model, we investigated ToM performance, and brain imaging correlates in relapsing-remitting (RR) and progressive (Pr) MS. 16RR, 19Pr, and 21 healthy controls were assessed with both cognitive (CToM) and affective ToM (AToM) tests and neuropsychological tools and were evaluated with MRI. Cortical thickness, sub-cortical volumetry, and tract-based-spatial-statistics were analyzed. Our results reported a CToM deficit in Pr, correlated with attention. While no relation between gray matter and CToM was observed, a widespread correlation between CToM and normal-appearing white matter was found. In particular, we registered a significant positive correlation between CToM and fractional anisotropy in Superior and Inferior Longitudinal Fasciculus and right thalamic radiation tracts. Moreover, an inverse correlation between CToM and mean diffusivity of the right fronto-occipital fasciculus, bilateral superior longitudinal fasciculus, cortico-spinal, left uncinate, corpus callosum, and forceps minor tracts was also observed. This work highlighted a double disconnection mechanism in Pr MS affecting communication both (1) inside the ToM network and (2) between the ToM network and cognitive execution areas, likely explaining the deficit in cognitive ToM. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor &amp; Francis Group.</p>"
220,2-s2.0-85106751770,Healing influence of melilotus officinalis herbal extract on experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in c57bl/6 mice,"<p>The present study was designed to primarily examine the therapeutic potential of the herbal extract of Melilotus Officinalis for the treatment of multiple sclerosis in the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model of the disease. The animal model was induced in C57BL/6 female mice, and then the herbal extract was intraperitoneally administered for a total of 21 days after the first day of post-immunization. The phenotypic signs, a gene expression profile of inflammatory cytokines, antioxidant state, and pathological hallmarks of the disease in the corpus callosum were evaluated. The prophylactic administration of Melilotus Officinalis attenuates the clinical signs of the disease. It significantly declined the gene expression of proinflammatory cytokines like IL-6, TNF-α, and IFN-γ. This herbal extract also surged the gene expression, as an anti-inflammatory cytokine. The gene expression of Glutathione peroxidase and Catalase (antioxidant enzymes) was meaningfully higher in the treatment group. Pathological evaluation of corpus callosum cross-sections by Luxol Fast Blue staining revealed preserved myelin sheath in the treated group compared to the EAE mice. The results of our assay confirmed that immunomodulatory and antioxidant features of the herbal extract of Melilotus Officinalis ameliorated the EAE severity. This study finding disclosed the therapeutic efficiency of this compound in MS treatment. © 2020, Iranian Journal of Pharmaceutical Research. All rights reserved.</p>"
221,2-s2.0-85092434863,Associations Between Findings From Myelin Water Imaging and Cognitive Performance Among Individuals With Multiple Sclerosis,"<p>Importance: Cognitive impairment is a debilitating symptom of multiple sclerosis (MS) that affects up to 70% of patients. An improved understanding of the underlying pathology of MS-related cognitive impairment would provide considerable benefit to patients and clinicians. Objective: To determine whether there is an association between myelin damage in tissue that appears completely normal on standard clinical imaging, but can be detected by myelin water imaging (MWI), with cognitive performance in MS. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this cross-sectional study, participants with MS and controls underwent cognitive testing and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) from August 23, 2017, to February 20, 2019. Participants were recruited through the University of British Columbia Hospital MS clinic and via online recruitment advertisements on local health authority websites. Cognitive testing was performed in the MS clinic, and MRI was performed at the adjacent academic research neuroimaging center. Seventy-three participants with clinically definite MS fulfilling the 2017 revised McDonald criteria for diagnosis and 22 age-, sex-, and education-matched healthy volunteers without neurological disease were included in the study. Data analysis was performed from March to November 2019. Exposures: MWI was performed at 3 T with a 48-echo, 3-dimensional, gradient and spin-echo (GRASE) sequence. Cognitive testing was performed with assessments drawn from cognitive batteries validated for use in MS. Main Outcomes and Measures: The association between myelin water measures, a measurement of the T2 relaxation signal from water in the myelin bilayers providing a specific marker for myelin, and cognitive test scores was assessed using Pearson correlation. Three white matter regions of interest-the cingulum, superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF), and corpus callosum-were selected a priori according to their known involvement in MS-related cognitive impairment. Results: For the 95 total participants, the mean (SD) age was 49.33 (11.44) years. The mean (SD) age was 50.2 (10.7) years for the 73 participants with MS and 46.4 (13.5) for the 22 controls. Forty-eight participants with MS (66%) and 14 controls (64%) were women. The mean (SD) years of education were 14.7 (2.2) for patients and 15.8 (2.5) years for controls. In MS, significant associations were observed between myelin water measures and scores on the Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SLF, r = -0.490; 95% CI, -0.697 to -0.284; P &lt; .001; corpus callosum, r = -0.471; 95% CI, -0.680 to -0.262; P &lt; .001; and cingulum, r = -0.419; 95% CI, -0.634 to -0.205; P &lt; .001), Selective Reminding Test (SLF, r = -0.444; 95% CI, -0.660 to -0.217; P &lt; .001; corpus callosum, r = -0.411; 95% CI, -0.630 to -0.181; P = .001; and cingulum, r = -0.361; 95% CI, -0.602 to -0.130; P = .003), and Controlled Oral Word Association Test (SLF, r = -0.317; 95% CI, -0.549 to -0.078; P = .01; and cingulum, r = -0.335; 95% CI, -0.658 to -0.113; P = .006). No significant associations were found in controls. Conclusions and Relevance: This study used MWI to demonstrate that otherwise normal-appearing brain tissue is diffusely damaged in MS, and the findings suggest that myelin water measures are associated with cognitive performance. MWI offers an in vivo biomarker feasible for use in clinical trials investigating cognition, providing a means for monitoring changes in myelination and its association with symptom worsening or improvement.</p>"
222,2-s2.0-85089655767,Diverse roles for hyaluronan and hyaluronan receptors in the developing and adult nervous system,"<p>Hyaluronic acid (HA) plays a vital role in the extracellular matrix of neural tissues. Originally thought to hydrate tissues and provide mechanical support, it is now clear that HA is also a complex signaling molecule that can regulate cell processes in the developing and adult nervous systems. Signaling properties are determined by molecular weight, bound proteins, and signal transduction through specific receptors. HA signaling regulates processes such as proliferation, differentiation, migration, and process extension in a variety of cell types including neural stem cells, neurons, astrocytes, microglia, and oligodendrocyte progenitors. The synthesis and catabolism of HA and the expression of HA receptors are altered in disease and influence neuroinflammation and disease pathogenesis. This review discusses the roles of HA, its synthesis and breakdown, as well as receptor expression in neurodevelopment, nervous system function and disease. © 2020 by the authors.

223,2-s2.0-85089515027,Microglial phagocytosis—rational but challenging therapeutic target in multiple sclerosis,"<p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common autoimmune and demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS), characterized, in the majority of cases, by initial relapses that later evolve into progressive neurodegeneration, severely impacting patients’ motor and cognitive functions. Despite the availability of immunomodulatory therapies effective to reduce relapse rate and slow disease progression, they all failed to restore CNS myelin that is necessary for MS full recovery. Microglia are the primary inflammatory cells present in MS lesions, therefore strongly contributing to demyelination and lesion extension. Thus, many microglial-based therapeutic strategies have been focused on the suppression of microglial pro-inflammatory phenotype and neurodegenerative state to reduce disease severity. On the other hand, the contribution of myelin phagocytosis advocating the neuroprotective role of microglia in MS has been less explored. Indeed, despite the presence of functional oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs), within lesioned areas, MS plaques fail to remyelinate as a result of the over-accumulation of myelin-toxic debris that must be cleared away by microglia. Dysregulation of this process has been associated with the impaired neuronal recovery and deficient remyelination. In line with this, here we provide a comprehensive review of microglial myelin phagocytosis and its involvement in MS development and repair. Alongside, we discuss the potential of phagocytic-mediated therapeutic approaches and encourage their modulation as a novel and rational approach to ameliorate MS-associated pathology. © 2020 by the authors.

224,2-s2.0-85087036142,Effects of EHP-101 on inflammation and remyelination in murine models of Multiple sclerosis,"<p>Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is characterized by a combination of inflammatory and neurodegenerative processes in the spinal cord and the brain. Natural and synthetic cannabinoids such as VCE-004.8 have been studied in preclinical models of MS and represent promising candidates for drug development. VCE-004.8 is a multitarget synthetic cannabidiol (CBD) derivative acting as a dual Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma/Cannabinoid receptor type 2 (PPARγ/CB<sub>2</sub>) ligand agonist that also activates the Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) pathway. EHP-101 is an oral lipidic formulation of VCE-004.8 that has shown efficacy in several preclinical models of autoimmune, inflammatory, fibrotic, and neurodegenerative diseases. EHP-101 alleviated clinical symptomatology in EAE and transcriptomic analysis demonstrated that EHP-101 prevented the expression of many inflammatory genes closely associated with MS pathophysiology in the spinal cord. EHP-101 normalized the expression of several genes associated with oligodendrocyte function such as Teneurin 4 (Tenm4) and Gap junction gamma-3 (Gjc3) that were downregulated in EAE. EHP-101 treatment prevented microglia activation and demyelination in both the spinal cord and the brain. Moreover, EAE was associated with a loss in the expression of Oligodendrocyte transcription factor 2 (Olig2) in the corpus callosum, a marker for oligodendrocyte differentiation, which was restored by EHP-101 treatment. In addition, EHP-101 enhanced the expression of glutathione S-transferase pi (GSTpi), a marker for mature oligodendrocytes in the brain. We also found that a diet containing 0.2% cuprizone for six weeks induced a clear loss of myelin in the brain measured by Cryomyelin staining and Myelin basic protein (MBP) expression. Moreover, EHP-101 also prevented cuprizone-induced microglial activation, astrogliosis and reduced axonal damage. Our results provide evidence that EHP-101 showed potent anti-inflammatory activity, prevented demyelination, and enhanced remyelination. Therefore, EHP-101 represents a promising drug candidate for the potential treatment of different forms of MS. © 2020</p>"

MOG antibody disease falls within the neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders (NMOSD), however clinical characteristics appear distinct from aquaporin-4 antibody related disease and multiple sclerosis.

226,2-s2.0-85090193008,Dynamic Responses of Microglia in Animal Models of Multiple Sclerosis,"<p>Microglia play an essential role in maintaining central nervous system (CNS) homeostasis, as well as responding to injury and disease. Most neurological disorders feature microglial activation, a process whereby microglia undergo profound morphological and transcriptional changes aimed at containing CNS damage and promoting repair, but often resulting in overt inflammation that sustains and propagates the neurodegenerative process. This is especially evident in multiple sclerosis (MS), were microglial activation and microglia-driven neuroinflammation are considered key events in the onset, progression, and resolution of the disease. Our understanding of microglial functions in MS has widened exponentially in the last decade by way of new tools and markers to discriminate microglia from other myeloid populations. Consequently, the complex functional and phenotypical diversity of microglia can now be appreciated. This, in combination with a variety of animal models that mimic specific features and processes of MS, has contributed to filling the gap of knowledge in the cascade of events underlying MS pathophysiology. The purpose of this review is to present the most up to date knowledge of the dynamic responses of microglia in the commonly used animal models of MS, specifically the immune-mediated experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model, and the chemically-induced cuprizone and lysolecithin models. Elucidating the spectrum of microglial functions in these models, from detrimental to protective, is essential to identify emerging targets for therapy and guide drug discovery efforts. © Copyright © 2020 Plastini, Desu and Brambilla.</p>"
227,2-s2.0-85089488306,Fractalkine-Dependent Microglial Pruning of Viable Oligodendrocyte Progenitor Cells Regulates Myelination,"<p>Oligodendrogenesis occurs during early postnatal development, coincident with neurogenesis and synaptogenesis, raising the possibility that microglia-dependent pruning mechanisms that modulate neurons regulate myelin sheath formation. Here we show a population of ameboid microglia migrating from the ventricular zone into the corpus callosum during early postnatal development, termed “the fountain of microglia,” phagocytosing viable oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) before onset of myelination. Fractalkine receptor-deficient mice exhibit a reduction in microglial engulfment of viable OPCs, increased numbers of oligodendrocytes, and reduced myelin thickness but no change in axon number. These data provide evidence that microglia phagocytose OPCs as a homeostatic mechanism for proper myelination. A hallmark of hypomyelinating developmental disorders such as periventricular leukomalacia and of adult demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis is increased numbers of oligodendrocytes but failure to myelinate, suggesting that microglial pruning of OPCs may be impaired in pathological states and hinder myelination. © 2020 The Authors</p>"
228,2-s2.0-85089363249,Probable Autoimmune Depression in a Patient With Multiple Sclerosis and Antineuronal Antibodies,"<p>Background: In a subgroup of patients with mood disorders, clear-cut organic disorders are responsible for depressive symptoms (e.g., autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis or systemic lupus erythematosus). In these cases, an organic affective disorder can be diagnosed. Case Presentation: The authors present the case of a 59-year-old male patient who developed a severe depressive episode over approximately 6 months and was, therefore, admitted to the hospital. In retrospect, he reported that, at age 39, he suffered from self-limiting sensory disturbances and muscle weakness in both legs. The current magnetic resonance imaging of his brain showed several conspicuous FLAIR-hyperintense supratentorial white matter lesions compatible with chronic inflammatory brain disease. Imaging of the spinal axis revealed no clear spinal lesions. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analyses showed CSF-specific oligoclonal bands. Therefore, multiple sclerosis was diagnosed. Further CSF analyses, using tissue-based assays with indirect immunofluorescence on unfixed murine brain tissue, revealed a (peri-)nuclear signal and a strong neuritic signal of many neurons, especially on granule cells in the cerebellum, hippocampus, and olfactory bulb, as well as in the corpus callosum. Additionally, antinuclear antibody (ANA) titers of 1:12,800 and a lymphopenia were detected in blood tests. Further system clarification showed no suspicion of rheumatic or oncological disease. Anti-inflammatory treatment led to rapid and sustained improvement. Conclusion: The present patient suffered from a probable “autoimmune depression” in the context of newly diagnosed multiple sclerosis with typical MRI and CSF pathologies, alongside mild concomitant latent systemic autoimmune process (with high-titer ANAs and lymphopenia) and unknown antineuronal antibodies. The case report illustrates that a depressive syndrome suggestive of primary idiopathic depressive disorder may be associated with an autoimmune brain involvement. The detection of such organic affective disorders is of high clinical relevance for affected patients, as it enables alternative and more causal treatment approaches. © Copyright © 2020 Endres, Rauer, Venhoff, Süß, Dersch, Runge, Fiebich, Nickel, Matysik, Maier, Domschke, Egger, Prüss and van Elst.</p>"
229,2-s2.0-85089688495,R-ras gtpases signaling role in myelin neurodegenerative diseases,"<p>Myelination is required for fast and efficient synaptic transmission in vertebrates. In the central nervous system, oligodendrocytes are responsible for creating myelin sheaths that isolate and protect axons, even throughout adulthood. However, when myelin is lost, the failure of remyelination mechanisms can cause neurodegenerative myelin-associated pathologies. From oligodendrocyte progenitor cells to mature myelinating oligodendrocytes, myelination is a highly complex process that involves many elements of cellular signaling, yet many of the mechanisms that coordinate it, remain unknown. In this review, we will focus on the three major pathways involved in myelination (PI3K/Akt/mTOR, ERK1/2-MAPK, and Wnt/β-catenin) and recent advances describing the crosstalk elements which help to regulate them. In addition, we will review the tight relation between Ras GTPases and myelination processes and discuss its potential as novel elements of crosstalk between the pathways. A better understanding of the crosstalk elements orchestrating myelination mechanisms is essential to identify new potential targets to mitigate neurodegeneration. © MDPI AG.

In children, only around 25% of unilateral ON cases are considered idiopathic. Despite being considered a clinical diagnosis per se, neuroimaging plays a crucial role in the diagnostic pathway for these patients. Methods: Demographic, clinical, and imaging data of all patients presenting with unilateral ON at a tertiary paediatric centre over 40 months (January 1, 2016, to April 30, 2019) were retrospectively analyzed. Results: A total of 10 patients filled the inclusion criteria. The average age of presentation was 14.1 years. Patients in this series had ON associated with multiple sclerosis (n = 2), anti-MOG demyelinating disorders (n = 2), and neuromyelitis optica with anti-AQP4 antibodies (n = 1). ON was determined to be secondary to Toxocara canis infection in 1 case and a side effect of anti-TNFα therapy (adalimumab) in another. MR imaging showed T2 hyperintensity and/or gadolinium enhancement of one of the optic nerves in all but 3 patients, and coincidently these were the cases with monophasic idiopathic ON (average follow-up period of 2 years). Additional brain MR findings directly contributed to the final diagnosis in half of the cases. Conclusions: These cases are demonstrative of the wide range of possible causes of unilateral ON in the paediatric population. The absence of typical ON features in MR imaging was strongly suggestive of idiopathic ON in this cohort (p &lt; 0.01). © 2020 S. Karger AG. All rights reserved.</p>"

The causes are heterogeneous and many. We report a late preterm neonate who presented with depressed sensorium, cranial nerve abnormalities, mixed hypertonia and hypotonia, and respiratory failure. Neuroimaging and electrophysiological studies were normal. She had neutropenia and elevated lactates in blood. Her dried blood spot analysis by tandem MS/MS showed normal acylcarnitine and amino acid profile. Plasma and cerebro spinal fluid (CSF) amino acid quantification were inconclusive, CSF folate was normal. Urine organic acid analysis showed elevated lactate. Semi-quantitative analysis of urine showed borderline elevation of 3-methylglutaconic acid. Diagnosis of 3-methylglutaconic aciduria (3MGA) type VIII was suggested by whole-exome sequencing, which revealed a homozygous, likely pathogenic, missense mutation in Exon 2 of HTRA2 gene (chr2.74757898A&gt;C). Her parents were found to be carriers of the same mutation. This underscores the importance of genetic studies in the evaluation of neonatal neuro-metabolic disorders.

232,2-s2.0-85084159741,"Cognitive impairment in early MS: contribution of white matter lesions, deep grey matter atrophy, and cortical atrophy","<p>Background: Cognitive impairment (CI) is a frequent and debilitating symptom in MS. To better understand the neural bases of CI in MS, this magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study aimed to identify and quantify related structural brain changes and to investigate their relation to each other. Methods: We studied 51 patients with CI and 391 patients with cognitive preservation (CP). We analyzed three-dimensional T1-weighted and FLAIR scans at 3 Tesla. We determined mean cortical thickness as well as volumes of cortical grey matter (GM), deep GM including thalamus, cerebellar cortex, white matter, corpus callosum, and white matter lesions (WML). We also analyzed GM across the whole brain by voxel-wise and surface-based techniques. Results: Mean disease duration was 5 years. Comparing MS patients with CI and CP, we found higher volumes of WML, lower volumes of deep and cortical GM structures, and lower volumes of the corpus callosum (all corrected p values &lt; 0.05). Effect sizes were largest for WML and thalamic volume (standardized ß values 0.25 and − 0.25). By logistic regression analysis including both WML and thalamic volume, we found a significant effect only for WML volume. Inclusion of the interaction term of WML and thalamic volume increased the model fit and revealed a highly significant interaction of WML and thalamic volume. Moreover, voxel-wise and surface-based comparisons of MS patients with CI and CP showed regional atrophy of both deep and cortical GM independent of WML volume and overall disability, but effect sizes were lower. Conclusion: Although several mechanisms contribute to CI already in the early stage of MS, WML seem to be the main driver with thalamic atrophy primarily intensifying this effect. © 2020, The Author(s).</p>"
233,2-s2.0-85083277303,A validation study of manual atrophy measures in patients with Multiple Sclerosis,"<p>Purpose: Manual measures such as corpus callosum index, normalized corpus callosum area, and width of the third ventricle are potential biomarkers for brain atrophy. In this work, we investigate their suitability to assess the neurodegenerative component of multiple sclerosis (MS) by comparing them to volumetric measures and expanded disability status scale (EDSS). Methods: Fifty-eight patients with a clinically isolated syndrome, 48 MS patients treated with interferon β, and 26 treated with natalizumab underwent a brain MRI at baseline and after 1 year. Manual measures were evaluated by two observers using Jim v.6.0 at both time points. Volumetric tools (SIENA/x and Freesurfer) were used to calculate normalized brain volume, brain parenchymal fraction, annualized percentage of brain volume change, corpus callosum volume, ventricle volume, and volume of the third ventricle. Statistical analyses were performed with SPSS v.13. Results: Usage of corpus callosum volume and third ventricle volume to validate normalized corpus callosum area and width of the third ventricle, respectively, showed very good correlations (r = 0.85, r = 0.83; p &lt; 0.01). Width of the third ventricle, corpus callosum index, and normalized corpus callosum area correlations were significant with EDSS in all patients and moderate to strong with normalized brain volume and brain parenchymal fraction in natalizumab-treated patients (respectively r = − 0.54, r = − 0.61; r = 0.55, r = 0.67; and r = 0.58, r = 0.67; with p &lt; 0.05). Conclusion: Width of the third ventricle and normalized corpus callosum area seem the more robust manual measures regarding correlation with volumetric measures and EDSS, especially in patients with more advanced disease. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.</p>"
234,2-s2.0-85088422557,Inflammation and Corticospinal Functioning in Multiple Sclerosis: A TMS Perspective,"<p>Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) has been employed in multiple sclerosis (MS) to assess the integrity of the corticospinal tract and the corpus callosum and to explore some physiological properties of the motor cortex. Specific alterations of TMS measures have been strongly associated to different pathophysiological mechanisms, particularly to demyelination and neuronal loss. Moreover, TMS has contributed to investigate the neurophysiological basis of MS symptoms, particularly those not completely explained by conventional structural damage, such as fatigue. However, variability existing between studies suggests that alternative mechanisms should be involved. Knowledge of MS pathophysiology has been enriched by experimental studies in animal models (i.e., experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis) demonstrating that inflammation alters synaptic transmission, promoting hyperexcitability and neuronal damage. Accordingly, TMS studies have demonstrated an imbalance between cortical excitation and inhibition in MS. In particular, cerebrospinal fluid concentrations of different proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory molecules have been associated to corticospinal hyperexcitability, highlighting that inflammatory synaptopathy may represent a key pathophysiological mechanism in MS. In this perspective article, we discuss whether corticospinal excitability alterations assessed with TMS in MS patients could be useful to explain the pathophysiological correlates and their relationships with specific MS clinical characteristics and symptoms. Furthermore, we discuss evidence indicating that, in MS patients, inflammatory synaptopathy could be present since the early phases, could specifically characterize relapses, and could progressively increase during the disease course. © Copyright © 2020 Stampanoni Bassi, Buttari, Gilio, De Paolis, Fresegna, Centonze and Iezzi.</p>"
235,2-s2.0-85086089679,Impaired cognition is related to microstructural integrity in relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis,"<p>Background: Cognitive impairment is common in multiple sclerosis (MS). However, the relationship between cognitive deficits and microstructural abnormalities in Chinese MS patients remains unclear. We aimed to investigate the importance of microstructural abnormalities and the associations with cognitive impairment in Chinese MS patients. Methods: Three-dimensional T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were obtained from 36 relapsing remitting MS patients. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) scans were acquired for 29 (81%) patients. Cognitive impairment was assessed using a comprehensive neuropsychological battery. Patients were classified into cognitively impaired (CI) group and cognitively preserved (CP) group. Using volBrain and FSL software, we assessed white matter lesion burden, white matter (WM) and gray matter (GM) volumetric as well as microstructural diffusivity. MRI variables explaining cognitive impairment were analyzed. Results: Fifteen (42%) patients were classified as CI. Verbal learning and memory was the most commonly impaired domain (n = 16, 44%). CI patients had lower mean skeleton fractional anisotropy (FA) value than CP patients (275.45 vs. 283.61 × 10<sup>−3</sup>, P = 0.023). The final predicting model including demographic variables and global skeleton mean diffusivity (MD) explained 43.6% of variance of the presence of cognitive impairment (β = 0.131, P = 0.041). CI patients showed a widespread change of microstructural integrity comparing to CP patients, which was rarely overlapping with lesion probability map. Microstructural abnormalities in corpus callosum were associated with performance in verbal learning and memory, processing speed and selective attention (P &lt; 0.05). Conclusion: Loss of microstructural integrity demonstrated by DTI helps explain cognitive dysfunction in Chinese MS patients. © 2020 The Authors.

236,2-s2.0-85084064945,Improvement of Remyelination in Demyelinated Corpus Callosum Using Human Adipose-Derived Stem Cells (hADSCs) and Pregnenolone in the Cuprizone Rat Model of Multiple Sclerosis,"<p>Adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) have neuroprotective effects, and their repair ability has been approved in neurodegenerative studies. Pregnenolone as a neurosteroid plays significant roles in neurogenesis. We aimed to consider the effect of ADSCs and pregnenolone injection on the multiple sclerosis (MS) model created by cuprizone. Male Wistar rats (n = 36) were fed with an ordinary diet or a diet with cuprizone (0.6%) for 3 weeks. H-ADSCs were taken from patients with lipoaspirate surgery. The rats were divided into six groups (n = 6): healthy, MS, sham, pregnenolone injection, ADSCs injection, pregnenolone and ADSCs injection. Behavioral test, histological examination and TEM were conducted. The specific markers for myelin and cell differentiation were assessed using immunohistochemistry staining. Additionally, the measure of MBP and MOG gene expression and the amount of related proteins were determined using real-time RT-PCR and ELISA techniques, respectively. Histologic results showed that induced demyelination in corpus callosum fibers. TEM revealed an increased thickness of myelin in fibers in the treated groups (P &lt; 0.05). Injection of hADSC and pregnenolone significantly increased the expression levels of MBP and MOG (P &lt; 0.001). The mean percentage of MOG and MBP markers were significantly increased in the treated groups compared to MS and sham groups (P &lt; 0.05). Moreover, the OD level of MBP and MOG proteins showed that their values in the ADSCs/pregnenolone group were close to those of the control group without a significant difference. Our data indicated the remyelination potency and cell differentiation can improve with ADSCs and pregnenolone treatments in the multiple sclerosis model which created by cuprizone in rats. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.</p>"
237,2-s2.0-85083723318,A comparison study of inhomogeneous magnetization transfer (ihMT) and magnetization transfer (MT) in multiple sclerosis based on whole brain acquisition at 3.0 T,"<p>Introduction: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a central nervous system disorder that may eventually affect its function. The clinical standard for MS severity is based on a clinical scale, which lacks lesion specific information. Magnetic resonance imaging of MS faces the challenge of myelin specificity, and in this work a new method inhomogeneous magnetization transfer (ihMT) is investigated as new biomarker of demyelination in MS. Methods: Local ethics committee approved this study and written informed consents were obtained. Between Oct 2017 to May 2018, eighteen patients with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) (6 males, 12 females, mean age 31.2) and sixteen healthy volunteers (6 males, 10 females, mean age 30.4 years) were enrolled in this prospective study. All subjects underwent MRI exams including MT and ihMT imaging as well as the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) assessments. Independent sample t-test were used to compare the difference of ihMT parameters between healthy white matter (HWM) and normal appearing white matter (NAWM) and between HWM and MS lesions, respectively. Spearman correlation were used to analyze the correlation between ihMT parameters of MS lesions and EDSS score. Results: The ihMTR and qihMT demonstrate significant differences between WHM and NAWM groups, while no significant differences are observed for MTR and qMT. All parameters show significant differences between HWM and MS groups (p &lt; 0.05). There was moderate negative correlation between MTR, qMT and EDSS score (−0.440 and −0.572), while there was a strong negative correlation between ihMTR and qihMT and EDSS score (−0.704 and −0.739). Conclusion: Based on whole brain analysis at 3.0 T, ihMT showed better correlation with EDSS compared to magnetization transfer imaging, and may be a potentially valuable biomarker for demyelination in MS. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.</p>"
238,2-s2.0-85083705826,Evaluation of cell transplant-mediated attenuation of diffuse injury in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis using onVDMP CEST MRI,"<p>The development and translation of cell therapies have been hindered by an inability to predict and evaluate their efficacy after transplantation. Using an experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mouse model of multiple sclerosis (MS), we studied attenuation of the diffuse injury characteristic of EAE and MS by transplanted glial-restricted precursor cells (GRPs). We assessed the potential of on-resonance variable delay multiple pulse (onVDMP) chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) MRI to visualize this attenuation. Allogeneic GRPs transplanted in the motor cortex or lateral ventricles attenuated paralysis in EAE mice and attenuated differences compared to naïve mice in onVDMP CEST signal 5 days after transplantation near the transplantation site. Histological analysis revealed that transplanted GRPs co-localized with attenuated astrogliosis. Hence, diffuse injury-sensitive onVDMP CEST MRI may complement conventional MRI to locate and monitor tissue regions responsive to GRP therapy. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.</p>"

Correct and early treatment is threatened by its real diagnostic challenge. Case report: We describe a 47-year-old man with tumefactive demyelination and testicular seminoma. He presented with aphasia, cognitive impairment and right sided weakness of the arm and lower face. MRI revealed a lesion characteristic of tumefactive demyelination. Cerebral biopsy confirmed this diagnosis. In addition, a testicular seminoma was diagnosed. Temporal association of demyelination and malignancy was highly suggestive for a paraneoplastic syndrome. He responded well to corticosteroid therapy plus orchiectomy, but a behavioral disturbance remained. Discussion: A good knowledge of specific imaging characteristics of tumefactive demyelination can help in early diagnosis. Multiple underlying causes should be considered, including, but not limited to multiple sclerosis. A paraneoplastic syndrome should not be overlooked. This is the fifth case in which seminoma is associated with a paraneoplastic tumefactive demyelination lesion. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.</p>"
240,2-s2.0-85061593448,White-matter-nulled MPRAGE at 7T reveals thalamic lesions and atrophy of specific thalamic nuclei in multiple sclerosis,"<p>Background: Investigating the degeneration of specific thalamic nuclei in multiple sclerosis (MS) remains challenging. Methods: White-matter-nulled (WMn) MPRAGE, MP-FLAIR, and standard T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were performed on MS patients (n = 15) and matched controls (n = 12). Thalamic lesions were counted in individual sequences and lesion contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) was measured. Volumes of 12 thalamic nuclei were measured using an automatic segmentation pipeline specifically developed for WMn-MPRAGE. Results: WMn-MPRAGE showed more thalamic MS lesions (n = 35 in 9 out of 15 patients) than MP-FLAIR (n = 25) and standard T1 (n = 23), which was associated with significant improvement of CNR (p &lt; 0.0001). MS patients had whole thalamus atrophy (p = 0.003) with lower volumes found for the anteroventral (p &lt; 0.001), the pulvinar (p &lt; 0.0001), and the habenular (p = 0.004) nuclei. Conclusion: WMn-MPRAGE and automatic thalamic segmentation can highlight thalamic MS lesions and measure patterns of focal thalamic atrophy. © The Author(s), 2019.</p>"
241,2-s2.0-85086604370,Myelination- And immune-mediated MR-based brain network correlates,"<p>Background: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease of the central nervous system (CNS), characterized by inflammatory and neurodegenerative processes. Despite demyelination being a hallmark of the disease, how it relates to neurodegeneration has still not been completely unraveled, and research is still ongoing into how these processes can be tracked non-invasively. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) derived brain network characteristics, which closely mirror disease processes and relate to functional impairment, recently became important variables for characterizing immune-mediated neurodegeneration; however, their histopathological basis remains unclear. Methods: In order to determine the MRI-derived correlates of myelin dynamics and to test if brain network characteristics derived from diffusion tensor imaging reflect microstructural tissue reorganization, we took advantage of the cuprizone model of general demyelination in mice and performed longitudinal histological and imaging analyses with behavioral tests. By introducing cuprizone into the diet, we induced targeted and consistent demyelination of oligodendrocytes, over a period of 5 weeks. Subsequent myelin synthesis was enabled by reintroduction of normal food. Results: Using specific immune-histological markers, we demonstrated that 2 weeks of cuprizone diet induced a 52% reduction of myelin content in the corpus callosum (CC) and a 35% reduction in the neocortex. An extended cuprizone diet increased myelin loss in the CC, while remyelination commenced in the neocortex. These histologically determined dynamics were reflected by MRI measurements from diffusion tensor imaging. Demyelination was associated with decreased fractional anisotropy (FA) values and increased modularity and clustering at the network level. MRI-derived modularization of the brain network and FA reduction in key anatomical regions, including the hippocampus, thalamus, and analyzed cortical areas, were closely related to impaired memory function and anxiety-like behavior. Conclusion: Network-specific remyelination, shown by histology and MRI metrics, determined amelioration of functional performance and neuropsychiatric symptoms. Taken together, we illustrate the histological basis for the MRI-driven network responses to demyelination, where increased modularity leads to evolving damage and abnormal behavior in MS. Quantitative information about in vivo myelination processes is mirrored by diffusion-based imaging of microstructural integrity and network characteristics. © 2020 The Author(s).</p>"
242,2-s2.0-85086354917,Transplantation of induced neural stem cells (iNSCs) into chronically demyelinated corpus callosum ameliorates motor deficits,"<p>Multiple Sclerosis (MS) causes neurologic disability due to inflammation, demyelination, and neurodegeneration. Immunosuppressive treatments can modify the disease course but do not effectively promote remyelination or prevent long term neurodegeneration. As a novel approach to mitigate chronic stage pathology, we tested transplantation of mouse induced neural stem cells (iNSCs) into the chronically demyelinated corpus callosum (CC) in adult mice. Male C57BL/6 mice fed 0.3% cuprizone for 12 weeks exhibited CC atrophy with chronic demyelination, astrogliosis, and microglial activation. Syngeneic iNSCs were transplanted into the CC after ending cuprizone and perfused for neuropathology 2 weeks later. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequences for magnetization transfer ratio (MTR), diffusion-weighted imaging (T2), and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) quantified CC pathology in live mice before and after iNSC transplantation. Each MRI technique detected progressive CC pathology. Mice that received iNSCs had normalized DTI radial diffusivity, and reduced astrogliosis post-imaging. A motor skill task that engages the CC is Miss-step wheel running, which demonstrated functional deficits from cuprizone demyelination. Transplantation of iNSCs resulted in marked recovery of running velocity. Neuropathology after wheel running showed that iNSC grafts significantly increased host oligodendrocytes and proliferating oligodendrocyte progenitors, while modulating axon damage. Transplanted iNSCs differentiated along astrocyte and oligodendrocyte lineages, without myelinating, and many remained neural stem cells. Our findings demonstrate the applicability of neuroimaging and functional assessments for pre-clinical interventional trials during chronic demyelination and detect improved function from iNSC transplantation. Directly reprogramming fibroblasts into iNSCs facilitates the future translation towards exogenous autologous cell therapies. © 2020 The Author(s).</p>"

244,2-s2.0-85097684081,Protective effects of a nano-formulation of curcumin against cuprizone-induced demyelination in the mouse corpus callosum,"<p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS), characterized by neuroinflammation, oligodendrocytes (OLs) loss, and demyelination Curcumin, a natural phenolic substance, has been shown to have significant therapeutic properties in various neurodegenerative diseases, including MS. In our laboratory by loading curcumin in dendrosome nanoparticles we improved its solubility and bioavailability. Our previous study showed anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative effects of dendrosomal nano-curcumin (DNC) in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model of MS. Here, by using a toxic demyelination model, induced by cuprizone (CPZ), we investigated the protective effect of DNC on oligodendroglial lineage cells (OLLC) and myelin preservation in context of acute demyelination. CPZ is a copper chelator, thus its intake reduces the mitochondrial activity, activates oxidative stress response, leading to specific OLs death, due to their high-energy consumption. We also evaluated DNC effect on activation of astrocytes and microglia, which are enriched in both MS and CPZ demyelinated lesions. Our results demonstrated that DNC treatment protected Oligodendrocyte lineage cells (OLLCs) against CPZ toxin. Besides DNC treatment suppressed accumulation of astrocytes and microglia in CC of CPZ-fed mice, compared to PBS treated onse. Moreover, DNC treatment lead to higher index of luxol fast bluefast blue (LFB) and myelin-specific proteins, myelin basic protein (MBP) intensity in the corpus callosum (CC), as indicators of myelin content. These results suggest a potent pleiotropic therapeutic efficiency for DNC for protection of myelinating cells, possibly via suppression of astrocytes and microglia. © 2020, Iranian Journal of Pharmaceutical Research.

245,2-s2.0-85087962851,Mature oligodendrocytes bordering lesions limit demyelination and favor myelin repair via heparan sulfate production,"<p>Myelin destruction is followed by resident glia activation and mobilization of endogenous progenitors (OPC) which participate in myelin repair. Here we show that in response to demyelination, mature oligodendrocytes (OLG) bordering the lesion express Ndst1, a key enzyme for heparan sulfates (HS) synthesis. Ndst1+ OLG form a belt that demarcates lesioned from intact white matter. Mice with selective inactivation of Ndst1 in the OLG lineage display increased lesion size, sustained microglia and OPC reactivity. HS production around the lesion allows Sonic hedgehog (Shh) binding and favors the local enrichment of this morphogen involved in myelin regeneration. In MS patients, Ndst1 is also found overexpressed in oligodendroglia and the number of Ndst1-expressing oligodendroglia is inversely correlated with lesion size and positively correlated with remyelination potential. Our study suggests that mature OLG surrounding demyelinated lesions are not passive witnesses but contribute to protection and regeneration by producing HS. © Macchi et al.</p>"
246,2-s2.0-85086007864,Could the heat shock proteins 70 family members exacerbate the immune response in multiple sclerosis? An in silico study,"<p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic autoimmune demyelinating disease of the central nervous system. It represents one of the main causes of neurological disability in young people. In MS, the autoimmune response is directed against myelin antigens but other possible bio-molecular markers are investigated. The aim of this work was, through an in silico study, the evaluation of the transcriptional modifications between healthy subjects and MS patients in six brain areas (corpus callosum, hippocampus, internal capsule, optic chiasm, frontal and parietal cortex) in order to identify genes representative of the disease. Our results show the upregulation of the Heat Shock Proteins (HSPs) HSPA1A, HSPA1B, HSPA7, HSPA6, HSPH1 and HSPA4L of the HSP70 family, among which HSPA1A and HSPA1B are upregulated in all the brain areas. HSP70s are molecular chaperones indispensable for protein folding, recently associated with immune system maintenance. The little overexpression of the HSPs protects the cells from stress but extreme upregulation can contribute to the MS pathogenesis. We also investigated the genes involved in the immune system that result in overall upregulation in the corpus callosum, hippocampus, internal capsule, optic chiasm and are absent in the cortex. Interestingly, the genes of the immune system and the HSP70s have comparable levels of expression. © 2020 by the authors.</p>"

We report four PML cases in immunocompromised patients, respectively treated with (1) Natalizumab, (2) Rituximab, (3) autologous stem-cell transplantation, and (4) Tacrolimus. All patients underwent neurological examination, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), JCV-DNA research on biological samples, and lymphocytes subpopulation study. All cases presented with motor, behavioural, and cognitive disorders. Visual, sensitive, and cerebellar deficits developed in three cases. MRI revealed widespread progressive demyelinating areas with active borders; three patients presented contrast enhancement. One patient developed inflammatory reconstitution syndrome (IRIS). At MRS, all cases presented decreased N-acetyl-aspartate (NAA) and three cases showed increased choline (Cho). In one patient, plasma and urine tested positive for JCV-DNA, while cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis confirmed JCV in two patients. The fourth patient had a low JCV-DNA blood titer and brain biopsy showed subacute necrosis. Two patients had abnormal lymphocyte subpopulations. Three patients underwent therapy with Mirtazapine, one of whom received Mefloquine in add-on. No clinical response was registered. Clinical onset, MRI and MRS were highly suggestive of PML in all patients, despite three cases presented contrast enhancement. In three cases JCV-DNA detection in biological samples confirmed the diagnosis. The fourth patient fulfilled diagnosis of “presumptive PML”. Our data confirm the importance to complete the diagnostic workup despite the presence of findings not completely consistent with classical PML. We hypothesize that atypical characteristics could due to the clinical conditions leading to PML. © 2020</p>"
248,2-s2.0-85083053040,Streamline density and lesion volume reveal a postero–anterior gradient of corpus callosum damage in multiple sclerosis,"<p>Background and purpose: Although interhemispheric disconnection significantly contributes to disability in multiple sclerosis (MS), the topography, timeline and relationship of callosal damage accrual with hemispheric damage are still unclear. Methods: Streamline density and the presence of focal lesions in five callosal subregions were computed in 55 people with MS [13 relapsing–remitting (RRMS), 20 secondary progressive (SPMS), 22 primary progressive (PPMS)] and 24 healthy controls. Results: Streamline density decrease was identified in SPMS in all corpus callosum (CC) subregions, in PPMS in the posterior CC and mid-posterior CC and in RRMS in the posterior CC. CC density was independently predicted by CC lesion volume and hemispheric lesion volume and independently predicted visuospatial memory, Expanded Disability Status Scale, manual dexterity and ambulation. Conclusions: The reduction in CC density across phenotypes suggests an earlier involvement of the posterior regions, followed only at a later stage by involvement of the anterior portions of the CC. Such interhemispheric disconnection seems to develop as a consequence of white matter macroscopic damage and exerts a relevant impact on motor and, to a lesser extent, cognitive disability. © 2020 European Academy of Neurology</p>"
249,2-s2.0-85081992831,Spinal cord demyelination in children: A diagnostic challenge in neuropaediatrics for a good outcome,"<p>Background: Biotinidase deficiency (BTD) is an autosomal recessive inborn error of metabolism provoking progressive biotin depletion, which causes, in turn, multiple carboxylase deficiency. Its infantile onset is characterized by intractable seizures associated with lethargy, psychomotor regression, hypotonia, feeding and respiratory problems, and cutaneous abnormalities. Case description: We describe a 52-month-old female whose clinical and neuroradiological pictures were consistent with myelopathy, which is generally more frequent in older patients, as well as with symptoms of an infantile onset of biotinidase deficiency, revealed at 17 months. Results: A biochemical biotinidase test revealed a profound deficiency of biotinidase detecting a 10% residual enzymatic activity, which led to the diagnosis of BTD. Gene sequencing revealed a compound heterozigous mutation (c.454A &gt; C/c.1612C &gt; T). Conclusion: Our findings suggest that even if myelopathy is uncommonly reported in BTD, and generally occurs in older children, its presence in childhood-onset floppiness should always be considered as a possible marker for an atypical presentation of BTD. Although, until recently, BTD myelopathy was believed to be prevalent in older children, a spinal cord involvement has also been described in at least nine cases in early infancy. Thus, another early diagnosis suggests that myelopathy may be more frequent than previously thought, and it is probably underdiagnosed because spinal MRI is not always routinely performed on these children. Early recognition of BTD disease is important as it would lead to prompt treatment, preventing irreversible brain damage and increasing the chances of complete recovery. © 2020 The Japanese Society of Child Neurology</p>"

In this study, we have examined the effects of metformin (MET) on the oligodendrogenesis, redox signaling, apoptosis, and glial responses during a self-repairing period (1-week) in the animal model of MS. Methods: For induction of demyelination, C57BL/6 J mice were fed a 0.2% cuprizone (CPZ) for 5 weeks. Thereafter, CPZ was removed for 1-week and molecular and behavioral changes were monitored in the presence or absence of MET (50 mg/kg body weight/day). Results: MET remarkably increased the localization of precursor OLGs (NG2<sup>+</sup>/O4<sup>+</sup> cells) and subsequently the renewal of mature OLGs (MOG<sup>+</sup> cells) in the corpus callosum via AMPK/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. Moreover, we observed a significant elevation in the antioxidant responses, especially in mature OLGs (MOG<sup>+</sup>/nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2<sup>+</sup>) cells) after MET intervention. MET also reduced brain apoptosis markers and lessened motor dysfunction in the open-field test. While MET was unable to decrease active astrogliosis (GFAP mRNA), it reduced microgliosis by down-regulation of Mac-3 mRNA a marker of pro-inflammatory microglia/macrophages. Molecular modeling studies, likewise, confirmed that MET exerts its effects via direct interaction with AMPK. Conclusions: Altogether, our study reveals that MET effectively induces lesion reduction and elevated molecular processes that support myelin recovery via direct activation of AMPK and indirect regulation of AMPK/Nrf2/mTOR pathway in OLGs. These findings facilitate the development of new therapeutic strategies based on AMPK activation for MS in the near future. © 2019, Maj Institute of Pharmacology Polish Academy of Sciences.</p>"
251,2-s2.0-85066834917,A multi-shell multi-tissue diffusion study of brain connectivity in early multiple sclerosis,"<p>Background: The potential of multi-shell diffusion imaging to produce accurate brain connectivity metrics able to unravel key pathophysiological processes in multiple sclerosis (MS) has scarcely been investigated. Objective: To test, in patients with a clinically isolated syndrome (CIS), whether multi-shell imaging-derived connectivity metrics can differentiate patients from controls, correlate with clinical measures, and perform better than metrics obtained with conventional single-shell protocols. Methods: Nineteen patients within 3 months from the CIS and 12 healthy controls underwent anatomical and 53-direction multi-shell diffusion-weighted 3T images. Patients were cognitively assessed. Voxel-wise fibre orientation distribution functions were estimated and used to obtain network metrics. These were also calculated using a conventional single-shell diffusion protocol. Through linear regression, we obtained effect sizes and standardised regression coefficients. Results: Patients had lower mean nodal strength (p = 0.003) and greater network modularity than controls (p = 0.045). Greater modularity was associated with worse cognitive performance in patients, even after accounting for lesion load (p = 0.002). Multi-shell-derived metrics outperformed single-shell-derived ones. Conclusion: Connectivity-based nodal strength and network modularity are abnormal in the CIS. Furthermore, the increased network modularity observed in patients, indicating microstructural damage, is clinically relevant.

Aim of this study is to determine the prevalence of GLA gene mutations in a large and representative population diagnosed with MS, simultaneously providing a critical revision of current literature reports of coexistence or misdiagnosis between these two conditions. Methods: In this mono-centric cross-sectional study, 927 patients fulfilling McDonald diagnostic criteria and encompassing all MS phenotypes were enrolled. Patients underwent evaluation of α-GalA activity and genotyping. Both genetic variants annotated as pathogenic and GVUS were considered. Estimated alleles frequencies were then compared to the ones reported in the gnomAD database. Results: GLA gene variants were found in seven individuals. Five patients carried variants previously described having controversial impact on FD phenotype, and the analysis of exome database revealed that they are not rare among healthy individuals. One patient showed a new variant never described before, and another one carried a late-onset FD cardiac variant. Conclusions: The overall prevalence of GLA gene variants in MS patients is comparable to the one estimated in healthy population. This result is further supported by critical revision of current literature evidences of misdiagnosis between MS and FD, arguing in favour of independence between these disorders. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.</p>"
253,2-s2.0-85091305249,ACU-net: A 3D attention context U-net for multiple sclerosis lesion segmentation,"<p>Multiple Sclerosis (MS) lesion segmentation from MR images is important for neuroimaging analysis. MS is diffuse, multifocal, and tend to involve peripheral brain structures such as the white matter, corpus callosum, and brainstem. Recently, U-Net has made great achievements in medical image segmentation area. However, the insufficiently use of context information and feature representation, makes it fail to achieve segmentation of MS lesions accurately. To solve the problem, 3D attention context U-Net (ACU-Net) is proposed for MS lesion segmentation in this paper. The proposed ACU-Net includes 3D spatial attention block, which is used to enrich spatial details and feature representation of lesion in the decoding stage. Furthermore, in the encoding and decoding stage of the network, 3D context guided module is designed for guiding local information and surrounding information. The proposed ACU-Net was evaluated on the ISBI 2015 longitudinal MS lesion segmentation challenge dataset, and it achieved superior performance compared to latest approaches. © 2020 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc..

254,2-s2.0-85086745950,Deep white matter lesions with persistent diffusion restriction on MRI as a diagnostic clue: Neuroimaging of a turkish family with hereditary diffuse leukoencephalopathy with spheroids and literature review,"<p>Background: Hereditary diffuse leukoencephalopathy with spheroids (HDLS), first described in 1984 is a rare disorder. Generally, it presents at adulthood with dementia, motor impairment, extrapyramidal abnormalities, and epilepsy. Definitive diagnosis is made by brain biopsy. Neuroimaging studies have revealed confluent white matter lesions predominantly in the frontal lobes, corpus callosum, and corticospinal tracts on conventional magnetic resonance imaging. Only a few reports showed diffusion restriction in the cerebral white matter; furthermore, rarer reports emphasized persistent foci of diffusion restriction as a diagnostic imaging marker. Objective: Herein, we have aimed to illustrate the first biopsy-proven Turkish HDLS pedigree consisting of 18 persons in 3 generations which contained 4 affected individuals. Materials and Methods: Four individuals in the pedigree of HDLS [two affected patients (patient III-1 and patient III-2) and two unaffected individuals (patient II-4 and patient III-5)] were investigated with conventional MRI and Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) using 1.5 Tesla (T) scanner. All four individuals were evaluated via neurological examinations and Mini-Mental State Examination. Brain biopsy study was performed on patient III-2. Finally, an extensive literature review involving pathology investigations and neuroimaging studies of HDLS patients was conducted. Results: DWIs of two investigated patients showed deep white matter lesions with persistent diffusion restriction. Computed tomography imaging showed punctate mineralization in the lesions. Biopsy specimens of patient III-2 demonstrated axonal spheroids which were typical for HDLS. Conclusions: Via the presentation of our pedigree and literature review, we suggest HDSL as a first-line differential diagnosis in patients with undiagnosed adult-onset familial leukoencephalopathy, in particular, those with MRI lesions of frontal white matter and centrum semiovale associated with foci of diffusion restriction and mineralization. Finally, we think that the persistence of the diffusion restriction in deep white matter lesions should be kept in mind as a crucial neuroimaging sign for HDLS. © 2006 - 2020 Annals of Indian Academy of Neurology | Published by Wolters Kluwer - Medknow.</p>"
255,2-s2.0-85084146817,A novel neurodegenerative spectrum disorder in patients with MLKL deficiency,"<p>Mixed lineage kinase domain-like (MLKL) is the main executor of necroptosis, an inflammatory form of programmed cell death. Necroptosis is implicated in combating infections, but also in contributing to numerous other clinical conditions, including cardiovascular diseases and neurodegenerative disorders. Inhibition of necroptosis is therefore of therapeutic interest. Here we report two siblings both of whom over the course of 35 years developed a similar progressive, neurodegenerative spectrum disorder characterized by paresis, ataxia and dysarthria. Magnetic resonance imaging of their central nervous system (CNS) revealed severe global cerebral volume loss and atrophy of the cerebellum and brainstem. These brothers are homozygous for a rare haplotype identified by whole genome sequencing carrying a frameshift variant in MLKL, as well as an in-frame deletion of one amino acid in the adjacent fatty acid 2-hydroxylase (FA2H) gene. Functional studies of patient-derived primary cells demonstrated that the variant in MLKL leads to a deficiency of MLKL protein resulting in impairment of necroptosis. Conversely, shotgun lipidomic analysis of the variant in FA2H shows no impact on either the abundance or the enzymatic activity of the encoded hydroxylase. To our knowledge, this is the first report of complete necroptosis deficiency in humans. The findings may suggest that impaired necroptosis is a novel mechanism of neurodegeneration, promoting a disorder that shares some clinical features with primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS) and other neurodegenerative diseases. Importantly, the necroptotic deficiency does not cause symptoms outside the nervous system, nor does it confer susceptibility to infections. Given the current interest in pharmacological inhibition of necroptosis by targeting MLKL and its associated pathways, this strategy should be developed with caution, with careful consideration of the possible development of adverse neurological effects. © 2020, The Author(s).</p>"
256,2-s2.0-85084118406,Mature myelin maintenance requires Qki to coactivate PPARβ-RXRα-mediated lipid metabolism,"<p>Lipid-rich myelin forms electrically insulating, axon-wrapping multilayers that are essential for neural function, and mature myelin is traditionally considered metabolically inert. Surprisingly, we discovered that mature myelin lipids undergo rapid turnover, and quaking (Qki) is a major regulator of myelin lipid homeostasis. Oligodendrocyte-specific Qki depletion, without affecting oligodendrocyte survival, resulted in rapid demyelination, within 1 week, and gradually neurological deficits in adult mice. Myelin lipids, especially the monounsaturated fatty acids and very-long-chain fatty acids, were dramatically reduced by Qki depletion, whereas the major myelin proteins remained intact, and the demyelinating phenotypes of Qki-depleted mice were alleviated by a high-fat diet. Mechanistically, Qki serves as a coactivator of the PPARβ-RXRα complex, which controls the transcription of lipid-metabolism genes, particularly those involved in fatty acid desaturation and elongation. Treatment of Qki-depleted mice with PPARβ/RXR agonists significantly alleviated neurological disability and extended survival durations. Furthermore, a subset of lesions from patients with primary progressive multiple sclerosis were characterized by preferential reductions in myelin lipid contents, activities of various lipid metabolism pathways, and expression level of QKI-5 in human oligodendrocytes. Together, our results demonstrate that continuous lipid synthesis is indispensable for mature myelin maintenance and highlight an underappreciated role of lipid metabolism in demyelinating diseases. © 2020, American Society for Clinical Investigation.</p>"
257,2-s2.0-85079543572,A novel role of cardiac inwardly rectifying potassium channels explaining autonomic cardiovascular dysfunctions in a cuprizone-induced mouse model of multiple sclerosis,"<p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory demyelinating and neurodegenerative disease of the central nervous system (CNS), believed to have an autoimmune etiology. MS patients showed an increased cardiovascular (CV) risk probably related to an impairment in the autonomic control of CV functions, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are not completely elucidated. Inwardly-rectifying potassium (Kir) channels play a key role in cardiac excitability by contributing to the repolarization phase of action potential and were recently identified as target of the autoantibody response in MS patients. Therefore, we investigated the role of cardiac Kir channels in the CV dysfunctions occurring in MS. Cardiac functions were evaluated by electrocardiographic recordings (ECG) in cuprizone-fed C57BL/6 mice, a classic demyelination animal model. Gene expression profiling of cardiac Kir2.2, Kir4.1 and Kir6.2 channels was performed using real-time PCR in mice. Cuprizone-induced mouse model was confirmed by immunohistochemistry analysis showing demyelination in the corpus callosum. ECG recordings from mice showed a significant decreased duration of the P wave and RR interval as well as an increase of the heart rate in cuprizone-treated mice as compared with the controls. Significant increased relative expression levels of Kcnj11 and Kcnj12, encoding for Kir6.2 and Kir2.2 channels respectively, were observed in mouse heart tissue, whereas no differences were found in mRNA levels of Kir4.1 channel as compared with controls. For the first time, these findings provided valuable insights into the potential role of Kir channels in cardiac problems associated with MS. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.</p>"
258,2-s2.0-85081264964,Deciphering the neural underpinnings of alexithymia in multiple sclerosis,"<p>Objectives: Alexithymia is a personality construct that could occur in up to 53 % of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). It entails difficulties in identifying and describing one's feelings and an externally oriented thinking. The current work aims to assess the neural underpinnings of alexithymia in this population. Methods: Forty-five patients with MS filled in the Toronto Alexithymia Scale (n = 17 with high alexithymia and n = 28 with low alexithymia). Brain magnetic resonance imaging was obtained for each patient and a morphometry algorithm (MorphoBox) was applied to calculate regional brain volumes. All patients underwent a clinical and neuropsychological evaluation which included measures for anxiety, depression, fatigue, daytime sleepiness, and basic and social cognition. Results: Compared to patients with low alexithymia, patients with high alexithymia had significantly higher fatigue and depression ratings, and lower empathy scores. In addition, they had lower volumes of corpus callosum, deep white matter, pallidum bilaterally, and left thalamus. In the whole cohort, alexithymia scores were inversely correlated with gray matter (thalamus and pallidum bilaterally) and white matter volumes (corpus callosum and bilateral deep white matter) after controlling for covariates (ps&lt;0.05). Conclusion: This study offers insights on the neuropsychological and neural substrates of alexithymia in MS. The current findings are consistent with alexithymia reports in other clinical populations, and suggest an association between alexithymia and atrophy of thalami, pallidum, corpus callosum and deep white matter in MS. Further research is needed to enhance the understanding of alexithymia mechanisms in this clinical context. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.</p>"
259,2-s2.0-85083496897,A dual effect of ursolic acid to the treatment of multiple sclerosis through both immunomodulation and direct remyelination,"<p>Current multiple sclerosis (MS) medications are mainly immunomodulatory, having little or no effect on neuroregeneration of damaged central nervous system (CNS) tissue; they are thus primarily effective at the acute stage of disease, but much less so at the chronic stage. An MS therapy that has both immunomodulatory and neuroregenerative effects would be highly beneficial. Using multiple in vivo and in vitro strategies, in the present study we demonstrate that ursolic acid (UA), an antiinflammatory natural triterpenoid, also directly promotes oligodendrocyte maturation and CNS myelin repair. Oral treatment with UA significantly decreased disease severity and CNS inflammation and demyelination in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of MS. Importantly, remyelination and neural repair in the CNS were observed even after UA treatment was started on day 60 post immunization when EAE mice had full-blown demyelination and axonal damage. UA treatment also enhanced remyelination in a cuprizone-induced demyelination model in vivo and brain organotypic slice cultures ex vivo and promoted oligodendrocyte maturation in vitro, indicating a direct myelinating capacity. Mechanistically, UA induced promyelinating neurotrophic factor CNTF in astrocytes by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ(PPARγ)/CREB signaling, as well as by up-regulation of myelin-related gene expression during oligodendrocyte maturation via PPARγ activation. Together, our findings demonstrate that UA has significant potential as an oral antiinflammatory and neural repair agent for MS, especially at the chronic-progressive stage. © 2020 National Academy of Sciences.

260,2-s2.0-85083413195,Delayed Demyelination and Impaired Remyelination in Aged Mice in the Cuprizone Model,"<p>To unravel the failure of remyelination in multiple sclerosis (MS) and to test promising remyelinating treatments, suitable animal models like the well-established cuprizone model are required. However, this model is only standardized in young mice. This does not represent the typical age of MS patients. Furthermore, remyelination is very fast in young mice, hindering the examination of effects of remyelination-promoting agents. Thus, there is the need for a better animal model to study remyelination. We therefore aimed to establish the cuprizone model in aged mice. 6-month-old C57BL6 mice were fed with different concentrations of cuprizone (0.2-0.6%) for 5-6.5 weeks. De- and remyelination in the medial and lateral parts of the corpus callosum were analyzed by immunohistochemistry. Feeding aged mice 0.4% cuprizone for 6.5 weeks resulted in the best and most reliable administration scheme with virtually complete demyelination of the corpus callosum. This was accompanied by a strong accumulation of microglia and near absolute loss of mature oligodendrocytes. Subsequent remyelination was initially robust but remained incomplete. The remyelination process in mature adult mice better represents the age of MS patients and offers a better model for the examination of regenerative therapies.</p>"
