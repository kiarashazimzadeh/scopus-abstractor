0,2-s2.0-85127375931,MR volumetry in detection of brain atrophic changes in MS patients and its implication on disease prognosis: retrospective study,"<p>Background: Multiple sclerosis is a chronic demyelinating disease of the central nervous system. It may lead to disability and cognitive impairment. Our study aimed at evaluation of the role of MR volumetry technique in detection of brain atrophic changes in patients with multiple sclerosis and its impact on disease prognosis. Results: This study was carried out on thirty healthy control with mean age 26.23 years and thirty patients with remitting relapsing multiple sclerosis, with a mean age of 28.18 years. Patients with multiple sclerosis were distributed across six subgroups based on the z-score cut-off of − 1.96 for regional and whole brain atrophy. We found that 2 patients (6.6%) showed no thalamic or brain atrophy, 28 patients (93.3%) showed whole brain atrophy only and 10 patients (33.3%) showed both, thalamic and BP atrophy. No patients showed only thalamic atrohy, 4 patients showed whole brain atrophy with other structure atrophy rather than thalamus (13.3%), 10 patients with whole brain and more than one structure atrophy (33.3%). Relation between subgroups and degree of increase in the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) as well as presence of cognitive decline were assessed. No significant relation were found between RRMS patients subgroups with whole brain atrophy, subgroup with isolated thalamic atrophy or subgroup with multiple structure atrophy and increase of EDSS or cognitive decline. Conclusion: We found that MRI volumetry is a very useful technique in the assessment of the atrophic changes that occur as a consequence of multiple sclerosis affecting the whole brain, deep grey matter as well as corpus callosum. Although our study did not prove significant relation between presence of brain atrophic changes and disability or cognitive impairment, presence of atrophy warrants careful clinical evaluation of those patients to detect any possible further progression of disability or cognitive decline. © 2022, The Author(s).</p>"
1,2-s2.0-85124238043,Neuroradiological differentiation of white matter lesions in patients with multiple sclerosis and Fabry disease,"<p>Objective: White matter lesions (WML) in multiple sclerosis (MS) differ from vascular WML caused by Fabry disease (FD). However, in atypical cases the discrimination can be difficult and may vary between individual raters. The aim of this study was to evaluate interrater reliability of WML differentiation between MS and FD patients. Materials and methods: Brain MRI scans of 21 patients with genetically confirmed FD were compared to 21 matched patients with MS. Pseudonymized axial FLAIR sequences were assessed by 6 blinded raters and attributed to either the MS or the FD group to investigate interrater reliability. Additionally, localization of WML was compared between the two groups. Results: The median age of patients was 46 years (IQR 35–58). Interrater reliability was moderate with a Fleiss' Kappa of 0.45 (95%CI 0.3–0.59). Overall, 85% of all ratings in the MS group and 75% in the FD group were correct. However, only 38% of patients with MS and 33% of patients with FD were correctly identified by all 6 raters. WML involving the corpus callosum (p &lt; 0.001) as well as juxtacortical (p &lt; 0.001) and infratentorial lesions (p = 0.03) were more frequently observed in MS patients. Conclusion: Interrater reliability regarding visual differentiation of WML in MS from vascular WML in FD on standard axial FLAIR images alone is only moderate, despite the distinctive features of lesions in each group. © 2022, The Author(s).</p>"
2,2-s2.0-85125650520,Ceramide kinase knockout ameliorates multiple sclerosis-like behaviors and demyelination in cuprizone-treated mice,"<p>Changes in sphingolipid metabolism regulate and/or alter many cellular functions in the brain. Ceramide, a central molecule of sphingolipid metabolism, is phosphorylated to ceramide-1-phosphate (C1P) by ceramide kinase (CerK). CerK and C1P were reported to regulate many cellular responses, but their roles in immune-related diseases in vivo have not been well elucidated. Thus, we investigated the effects of CerK knockout on the onset/progression of multiple sclerosis (MS), which is a chronic neurodegenerative disease accompanied by the loss of myelin sheaths in the brain. MS-model mice were prepared using a diet containing the copper chelator cuprizone (CPZ). Treatment of 8-week-old mice with 0.2% CPZ for 8 weeks resulted in motor dysfunction based on the Rota-rod test, and caused the loss of myelin-related proteins (MRPs) in the brain and demyelination in the corpus callosum without affecting synaptophysin levels. CerK knockout, which did not affect developmental changes in MRPs, ameliorated the motor dysfunction, loss of MRPs, and demyelination in the brain in CPZ-treated mice. Loss of tail tonus, another marker of motor dysfunction, was detected at 1 week without demyelination after CPZ treatment in a CerK knockout-independent manner. CPZ-induced loss of tail tonus progressed, specifically in female mice, to 6–8 weeks, and the loss was ameliorated by CerK knockout. Activities of ceramide metabolic enzymes including CerK in the lysates of the brain were not affected by CPZ treatment. Inhibition of CerK as a candidate for MS treatment was discussed. © 2022</p>"

Here, we report on 17 previously unpublished patients carrying HNRNPU pathogenic variants. All patients were found to harbor de novo loss-of-function variants except for one individual where the inheritance could not be determined, as a parent was unavailable for testing. All patients had seizures which started in early childhood, global developmental delay, intellectual disability, and dysmorphic features. In addition, hypotonia, behavioral abnormalities (such as autistic features, aggression, anxiety, and obsessive–compulsive behaviors), and cardiac (septal defects) and/or brain abnormalities (ventriculomegaly and corpus callosum thinning/agenesis) were frequently observed. We have noted four recurrent variants in the literature (c.1089G&gt;A p.(Trp363*), c.706_707del p.(Glu236Thrfs*6), c.847_857del p.(Phe283Serfs*5), and c.1681dels p.(Gln561Serfs*45)). © 2022 The Authors.

4,2-s2.0-85116499252,"Correlations between hippocampal functional connectivity, structural changes, and clinical data in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis: A case-control study using multimodal magnetic resonance imaging","<p>Multiple sclerosis is associated with structural and functional brain alterations leading to cognitive impairments across multiple domains including attention, memory, and the speed of information processing. The hippocampus, which is a brain important structure involved in memory, undergoes microstructural changes in the early stage of multiple sclerosis. In this study, we analyzed hippocampal function and structure in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis and explored correlations between the functional connectivity of the hippocampus to the whole brain, changes in local brain function and microstructure, and cognitive function at rest. We retrospectively analyzed data from 20 relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis patients admitted to the Department of Neurology at the China-Japan Union Hospital of Jilin University, China, from April 2015 to November 2019. Sixteen healthy volunteers were recruited as the healthy control group. All participants were evaluated using a scale of extended disability status and the Montreal cognitive assessment within 1 week before and after head diffusion tensor imaging and functional magnetic resonance imaging. Compared with the healthy control group, the patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis had lower Montreal cognitive assessment scores and regions of simultaneously enhanced and attenuated whole-brain functional connectivity and local functional connectivity in the bilateral hippocampus. Hippocampal diffusion tensor imaging data showed that, compared with the healthy control group, patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis had lower hippocampal fractional anisotropy values and higher mean diffusivity values, suggesting abnormal hippocampal structure. The left hippocampus whole-brain functional connectivity was negatively correlated with the Montreal cognitive assessment score (r =-0.698, P = 0.025), and whole-brain functional connectivity of the right hippocampus was negatively correlated with extended disability status scale score (r =-0.649, P = 0.042). The mean diffusivity value of the left hippocampus was negatively correlated with the Montreal cognitive assessment score (r =-0.729, P = 0.017) and positively correlated with the extended disability status scale score (r = 0.653, P = 0.041). The right hippocampal mean diffusivity value was positively correlated with the extended disability status scale score (r = 0.684, P = 0.029). These data suggest that the functional connectivity and presence of structural abnormalities in the hippocampus in patients with relapse-remission multiple sclerosis are correlated with the degree of cognitive function and extent of disability.

5,2-s2.0-85123731842,Abnormal oxidative metabolism in the cuprizone mouse model of demyelination: An in vivo NIRS-MRI study,"<p>Disruptions in oxidative metabolism may occur in multiple sclerosis and other demyelinating neurological diseases. The impact of demyelination on metabolic rate is also not understood. It is possible that mitochondrial damage may be associated with many such neurological disorders. To study oxidative metabolism with one model of demyelination, we implemented a novel multimodal imaging technique combining Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) and MRI to cuprizone mouse model. The cuprizone model is used to study demyelination and may be associated with inhibition of mitochondrial function. Cuprizone mice showed reduced oxygen extraction fraction (−39.1%, p ≤ 0.001), increased tissue oxygenation (6.4%, p ≤ 0.001), and reduced cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen in cortical gray matter (−62.1%, p ≤ 0.001). These changes resolved after the cessation of cuprizone exposure and partial remyelination. A decrease in hemoglobin concentration (−34.4%, p ≤ 0.001), but no change in cerebral blood flow were also observed during demyelination. The oxidized state of the mitochondrial enzyme, Cytochrome C Oxidase (CCO) increased (46.3%, p ≤ 0.001) while the reduced state decreased (−34.4%, p ≤ 0.05) significantly in cuprizone mice. The total amount of CCO did not change significantly during cuprizone exposure. Total CCO did decline after recovery both in control (−23.1%, p ≤ 0.01) and cuprizone (−28.8%, p ≤ 0.001) groups which may relate to age. A reduction in the magnetization transfer ratio, indicating demyelination, was found in the cuprizone group in the cerebral cortex (−3.2%, p ≤ 0.01) and corpus callosum (−5.5%, p ≤ 0.001). In summary, we were able to detect evidence of altered CCO metabolism during cuprizone exposure, consistent with a mitochondrial defect. We observed increased oxygenation and reduced metabolic rate associated with reduced myelination in the gray and white matter. The novel multimodal imaging technique applied here shows promise for noninvasively assessing parameters associated with oxidative metabolism in both mouse models of neurological disease and for translation to study oxidative metabolism in the human brain. © 2022</p>"
6,2-s2.0-85126910627,Development of a Chemical Cocktail That Rescues Mouse Brain Demyelination in a Cuprizone-Induced Model,"<p>Oligodendrocytes are glial cells located in the central nervous system (CNS) that play essential roles in the transmission of nerve signals and in the neuroprotection of myelinated neurons. The dysfunction or loss of oligodendrocytes leads to demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS). To treat demyelinating diseases, the development of a therapy that promotes remyelination is required. In the present study, we established an in vitro method to convert human fibroblasts into induced oligodendrocyte-like cells (iOLCs) in 3 days. The induced cells displayed morphologies and molecular signatures similar to oligodendrocytes after treatment with valproic acid and exposure to the small molecules Y27632, SU9516, and forskolin (FSK). To pursue the development of a cell-free remyelination therapy in vivo, we used a cuprizone-induced demyelinated mouse model. The small molecules (Y27632, SU9516, and FSK) were directly injected into the demyelinated corpus callosum of the mouse brain. This combination of small molecules rescued the demyelination phenotype within two weeks as observed by light and electron microscopy. These results provide a foundation for exploring the development of a treatment for demyelinating diseases via regenerative medicine. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.</p>"
7,2-s2.0-85124043337,Locomotor and histological changes in a cuprizone-induced animal model of multiple sclerosis: Comparison between alpha-tocopherol and fingolimod,"<p>Background and purpose: Fingolimod is a sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor modulator used to treat multiple sclerosis (MS). Alpha-tocopherol (AT) has been found to improve motor function in an animal model of MS. In the present study, the effects of AT and fingolimod on the locomotor function and histological evidence of demyelination were compared in a cuprizone-induced rat model of MS. Experimental approach: Female Sprague-Dawley rats (8 weeks) were fed with 0.2% (w/w) cuprizone diet for 5 weeks followed by intraperitoneal injections of fingolimod (3 mg/Kg; group F, n = 10) and alpha- tocopherol (100 mg/Kg; group A, n = 10). Vehicle-treated rats (group V, n = 10) were treated intraperitoneally with 1% ethanol in saline on weeks 6 and 7. Open field and beam walking tests were carried out every 10 days. The mean area of demyelination in the corpus callosum was quantified using Luxol fast blue stained histological sections of the forebrain. Findings/Results: The mean speed of movement was increased by 54% and 50% in groups F and A compared to group V. Total distance moved was increased by 61% and 52.7% in groups F and A compared to group V. Mean time to walk the beam was reduced in group A by 52% compared to group V. Mean frequency of crossing lines from the inner squares to outer squares was reduced in groups A and F compared to group V. Mean area of demyelination in corpus callosum showed 62% reduction in group A compared to group V. Conclusion and implications: Both fingolimod and AT treatments improved the locomotor function. However, AT treatment reduced the areas of demyelination in higher proportion and improved motor coordination and exploratory behavior. © 2022 Wolters Kluwer Medknow Publications.

8,2-s2.0-85118626969,Adult-onset vanishing white matter in a patient with EIF2B3 variants misdiagnosed as multiple sclerosis,"<p>Background: Vanishing white matter (VWM) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by childhood ataxia with central hypomyelination. Adult-onset VWM should be considered as a differential diagnosis for suspected cases of multiple sclerosis (MS). Methods: Targeted region sequencing (TRS) and Sanger sequencing validation were performed to identify and validate the likely pathogenic mutations in a family with VWM. Results: The main clinical manifestations of the proband included decreased vision and sleepiness accompanied by atrophy of the corpus callosum, affected inner rim of the corpus callosum, decreased apparent diffusion coefficient value or persistent hyperintensity-diffusion-weighted imaging, atrophied optic nerve, and no recordable visual evoked potentials. Due to the slow development and atypical VWM image features, MS was initially suspected. After prednisone was administered, the patient’s condition did not improve significantly, and other diseases were considered. The TRS and Sanger sequencing identified compound heterozygous mutations of EIF2B3 in the proband; c.965C &gt; G /p.Ala322Gly in exon 8 and c.130G &gt; A/p.Glu44Lys in exon 2 were missense mutations inherited from the mother and father, respectively. The proband’s oldest brother had the same compound heterozygous mutations but showed no symptoms. Conclusion: This is the first report of adult-onset VWM in a Chinese family. Initially, MS was suspected, and genetic testing confirmed the diagnosis of VWM. This study may further broaden the clinical spectrum of EIF2B3, thus providing a foundation for further research on the pathogenesis and genetic therapy for VWM. © 2021, Fondazione Società Italiana di Neurologia.</p>"
9,2-s2.0-85112643233,An in vivo implementation of the MEX MRI for myelin fraction of mice brain,"<p>Objective: Magnetization EXchange (MEX) sequence measures a signal linearly dependent on the myelin proton fraction by selective suppression of water magnetization and a recovery period. Varying the recovery period enables extraction of the percentile fraction of myelin bound protons. We aim to demonstrate the MEX sequence sensitivity to the fraction of protons associated with myelin in mice brain, in vivo. Methods: The cuprizone mouse model was used to manipulate the myelin content. Mice fed cuprizone (n = 15) and normal chow (n = 8) were imaged in vivo using MEX sequence. MR images were segmented into corpus callosum and internal capsule (white matter) and cortical gray matter, and fitted to the recovery equation. Results were analyzed with correlation to MWF and histopathology. Results: The extracted parameters show significant differences in the corpus callosum between the cuprizone and control groups. The cuprizone group exhibited reduced myelin fraction 26.5% (P &lt; 0.01). The gray matter values were less affected, with 13.5% reduction (P &lt; 0.05); no changes were detected in the internal capsule. Results were validated by MWF scans and good correlation to the histology analysis (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.685). Conclusion: The results of this first in vivo implementation of the MEX sequence provide a quantitative measure of demyelination in brain white matter. © 2021, European Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine and Biology (ESMRMB).</p>"
10,2-s2.0-85112577145,Functional and structural MRI correlates of executive functions in multiple sclerosis,"<p>Background: Executive dysfunctions, including difficulties in attention, working memory, planning, and inhibition affect 15%–28% of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. Objectives: To investigate structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) abnormalities underlying executive function (EF) in MS patients. Methods: A total 116 MS patients and 65 controls underwent resting-state (RS) and diffusion-weighted sequences and neuropsychological examination, including Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST) to test EF. Brain RS cognitive networks and fractional anisotropy (FA) from a priori selected white matter tracts were derived. Associations of WCST scores with RS functional connectivity (FC) and FA abnormalities were investigated. Results: In MS patients, predictors of working memory/updating were: lower corpus callosum (CC) FA, lower left working-memory network (WMN), right WMN RS FC for worse performance; lower executive control network (ECN), higher default-mode network (DMN), and salience network (SN) RS FC for better performance (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.35). Predictors of attention were lower CC genu FA, lower left WMN, and DMN RS FC for worse performance; higher left WMN and ECN RS FC for better performance (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.24). Predictors of worse shifting/inhibition were lower CC genu and superior cerebellar peduncle (SCP) FA, lower left WMN RS FC for worse performance; and higher ECN RS FC for better performance (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.24). Conclusions: CC and SCP microstructural damage and RS FC abnormalities in cognitive networks underlie EF frailty in MS. © The Author(s), 2021.</p>"
11,2-s2.0-85112329645,White matter microstructural differences in children and genetic risk for multiple sclerosis: A population-based study,"<p>Background: MS patients show abnormalities in white matter (WM) on brain imaging, with heterogeneity in the location of WM lesions. The “pothole” method can be applied to diffusion-weighted images to identify spatially distinct clusters of divergent brain WM microstructure. Objective: To investigate the association between genetic risk for MS and spatially independent clusters of decreased or increased fractional anisotropy (FA) in the brain. In addition, we studied sex- and age-related differences. Methods: 3 Tesla diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data were collected in 8- to 12-year-old children from a population-based study. Global and tract-based potholes (lower FA clusters) and molehills (higher FA clusters) were quantified in 3047 participants with usable DTI data. A polygenic risk score (PRS) for MS was calculated in genotyped individuals (n = 1087) and linear regression analyses assessed the relationship between the PRS and the number of potholes and molehills, correcting for multiple testing using the False Discovery Rate. Results: The number of molehills increased with age, potholes decreased with age, and fewer potholes were observed in girls during typical development. The MS-PRS was positively associated with the number of molehills (β = 0.9, SE = 0.29, p = 0.002). Molehills were found more often in the corpus callosum (β = 0.3, SE = 0.09, p = 0.0003). Conclusion: Genetic risk for MS is associated with spatially distinct clusters of increased FA during childhood brain development. © The Author(s), 2021.</p>"
12,2-s2.0-85112321703,"Volume changes of thalamus, hippocampus and cerebellum are associated with specific CSF profile in MS","<p>Background: The underlying pathogenesis of surface-in grey matter abnormalities in MS, demonstrated by both neuropathology and advanced MRI analyses, is under investigation and it might be related to CSF-mediated mechanism of inflammation and/or damage. Objective: To examine the link of CSF inflammatory profile with the damage of three regions early-involved in MS and bordering with CSF: thalamus, hippocampus and cerebellum. Methods: In this longitudinal, prospective study, we evaluated, in 109 relapsing–remitting MS patients, at diagnosis and after 2-year follow-up, the association between the baseline CSF level of 19 inflammatory mediators and the volume changes of thalamus, hippocampus, cerebellar cortex and control regions (globus pallidus, putamen). Results: The multivariable analysis showed that the CXCL13 and sCD163 CSF levels at baseline were independent predictors of thalamus ((Formula presented.) ; p &lt; 0.001) and hippocampus ((Formula presented.) ; p &lt; 0.001) volume change after 2-year follow-up. These molecules, plus CCL25, IFN-γ and fibrinogen, were independent predictors of the cerebellar cortex volume loss ((Formula presented.) ; p &lt; 0.001). No independent predictors of volume changes of the control regions were found. Conclusion: Our results indicate an association between the CSF inflammatory profile and grey matter volume loss of regions anatomically close to CSF boundaries, thus supporting the hypothesis of a surface-in GM damage in MS. © The Author(s), 2021.</p>"
13,2-s2.0-85127886516,Rapid parameter estimation for selective inversion recovery myelin imaging using an open-source Julia toolkit,"<p>Background: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is used extensively to quantify myelin content, however computational bottlenecks remain challenging for advanced imaging techniques in clinical settings. We present a fast, open-source toolkit for processing quantitative magnetization transfer derived from selective inversion recovery (SIR) acquisitions that allows parameter map estimation, including the myelin-sensitive macromolecular pool size ratio (PSR). Significant progress has been made in reducing SIR acquisition times to improve clinically feasibility. However, parameter map estimation from the resulting data remains computationally expensive. To overcome this computational limitation, we developed a computationally efficient, open-source toolkit implemented in the Julia language. Methods: To test the accuracy of this toolkit, we simulated SIR images with varying PSR and spin-lattice relaxation time of the free water pool (R<sub>1f</sub>) over a physiologically meaningful scale from 5% to 20% and 0.5 to 1.5 s<sup>−1</sup>, respectively. Rician noise was then added, and the parameter maps were estimated using our Julia toolkit. Probability density histogram plots and Lin’s concordance correlation coefficients (LCCC) were used to assess accuracy and precision of the fits to our known simulation data. To further mimic biological tissue, we generated five cross-linked bovine serum albumin (BSA) phantoms with concentrations that ranged from 1.25% to 20%. The phantoms were imaged at 3T using SIR, and data were fit to estimate PSR and R<sub>1f</sub>. Similarly, a healthy volunteer was imaged at 3T, and SIR parameter maps were estimated to demonstrate the reduced computational time for a real-world clinical example. Results: Estimated SIR parameter maps from our Julia toolkit agreed with simulated values (LCCC &gt; 0.98). This toolkit was further validated using BSA phantoms and a whole brain scan at 3T. In both cases, SIR parameter estimates were consistent with published values using MATLAB. However, compared to earlier work using MATLAB, our Julia toolkit provided an approximate 20-fold reduction in computational time. Conclusions: Presented here, we developed a fast, open-source, toolkit for rapid and accurate SIR MRI using Julia. The reduction in computational cost should allow SIR parameters to be accessible in clinical settings. Copyright 2022 Sisco et al.</p>"

15,2-s2.0-85127942631,Clemastine Induces an Impairment in Developmental Myelination,"<p>Abnormalities in myelination are associated to behavioral and cognitive dysfunction in neurodevelopmental psychiatric disorders. Thus, therapies to promote or accelerate myelination could potentially ameliorate symptoms in autism. Clemastine, a histamine H1 antagonist with anticholinergic properties against muscarinic M1 receptor, is the most promising drug with promyelinating properties. Clemastine penetrates the blood brain barrier efficiently and promotes remyelination in different animal models of neurodegeneration including multiple sclerosis, ischemia and Alzheimer’s disease. However, its role in myelination during development is unknown. We showed that clemastine treatment during development increased oligodendrocyte differentiation in both white and gray matter. However, despite the increase in the number of oligodendrocytes, conduction velocity of myelinated fibers of corpus callosum decreased in clemastine treated mice. Confocal and electron microscopy showed a reduction in the number of myelinated axons and nodes of Ranvier and a reduction of myelin thickness in corpus callosum. To understand the mechanisms leading to myelin formation impairment in the presence of an excess of myelinating oligodendrocytes, we focused on microglial cells that also express muscarinic M1 receptors. Importantly, the population of CD11c<sup>+</sup> microglia cells, necessary for myelination, as well as the levels of insulin growth factor-1 decrease in clemastine-treated mice. Altogether, these data suggest that clemastine impact on myelin development is more complex than previously thought and could be dependent on microglia-oligodendrocyte crosstalk. Further studies are needed to clarify the role of microglia cells on developmental myelination.

16,2-s2.0-85126785569,Diffusion Tensor Imaging Revealed Microstructural Changes in Normal-Appearing White Matter Regions in Relapsing–Remitting Multiple Sclerosis,"<p>Background: Axons and myelin sheaths are the physical foundation for white matter (WM) to perform normal functions. Our previous study found the metabolite abnormalities in frontal, parietal, and occipital normal-appearing white matter (NAWM) regions in relapsing–remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) patients by applying a 2D <sup>1</sup>H magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging method. Since the metabolite changes may associate with the microstructure changes, we used the diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) method to assess the integrity of NAWM in this study. Method: Diffusion tensor imaging scan was performed on 17 clinically definite RRMS patients and 21 age-matched healthy controls on a 3.0-T scanner. DTI metrics including fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (AD), and radial diffusivity (RD) were extracted from 19 predefined regions of interest (ROIs), which were generated by removing a mask of manually drawn probabilistic lesion map from the Johns Hopkins University white-matter atlas. The mean values of FA, MD, AD, and RD were compared between different groups in the same ROIs. Results: A probabilistic lesion map was successfully generated, and the lesion regions were eliminated from the WM atlas. We found that the RRMS patients had significantly lower FA in the entire corpus callosum (CC), bilateral of anterior corona radiata, and right posterior thalamic radiation (PTR). At the same time, RRMS patients showed significantly higher MD in the bilateral anterior corona radiata and superior corona radiata. Moreover, all AD values increased, and the bilateral external capsule, PTR, and left tapetum NAWM show statistical significance. What is more, all NAWM tracts showed increasing RD values in RRMS patients, and the bilateral superior corona radiata, the anterior corona radiata, right PTR, and the genu CC reach statistical significance. Conclusion: Our study revealed widespread microstructure changes in NAWM in RRMS patients through a ready-made WM atlas and probabilistic lesion map. These findings support the hypothesis of demyelination, accumulation of inflammatory cells, and axonal injury in NAWM for RRMS. The DTI-based metrics could be considered as potential non-invasive biomarkers of disease severity. Copyright © 2022 Bao, Tu, Li, Sun, Hu, Zhang and Li.</p>"
17,2-s2.0-85127520222,An Equivocal SCC Lesion—Antiepileptic-Induced CLOCC,"<p>We present a case of a woman who reported to the emergency unit due to recurrent episodes of severe headache and collapse. MRI examination revealed no relevant findings apart from small meningioma of the right parietal region. The patient was diagnosed with epilepsy and received outpatient treatment, which was changed due to poor toleration. A follow-up MRI was performed which revealed an isolated, focal lesion of the splenium of the corpus callosum. The patient underwent extensive laboratory testing and antiseizure medications were started again. Another MRI indicated substantial regression of the splenium of the corpus callosum (SCC) lesion. Both the complete clinical image and results of the diagnostic evaluation spoke in favor of cytotoxicity of the corpus callosum associated with anti-epileptic drug treatment. Pathologies involving the corpus callosum include congenital, demyelination, infection, neoplasm, trauma and vascular changes. Isolated, non-specific lesions of the splenium of corpus callosum usually indicate multiple sclerosis; however, other pathologies should be considered. Anti-epileptic drugs may evoke cytotoxic lesions of the corpus callosum (CLOCCs). © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.</p>"

19,2-s2.0-85123220024,"Two-dimensional measurements with cut-off values are useful for assessing brain volume, physical disability, and processing speed in multiple sclerosis","<p>Background: Two-dimensional (2D) measures have been proposed as potential proxy measures for whole-brain volume in multiple sclerosis (MS); however, cut-off values that determine the degree of brain volume loss (BVL) have not been established. Since we had previously developed a system to categorize MS patients into clusters with significantly different degrees of BVL, we tried to identify cut-off values for 2D measurements that can discriminate MS patients on the basis of disease severity associated with brain atrophy. Methods: In this cross-sectional analysis, ninety-one consecutive Japanese MS patients—clinically isolated syndrome (5%), relapsing-remitting MS (78%) and progressive MS (17%)—were categorized into two clusters (CL1 and CL2) with a significantly different degree of BVL using the method described in our previous study. MS patients were also evaluated for 2D measurements, namely, third ventricle width, lateral ventricle width (LVW), bicaudate ratio (BCR), and corpus callosum index (CCI). Thereafter, we performed receiver operating characteristic analysis to determine the cut-off values of the 2D measurements for categorizing the MS patients into two clusters. Results: We identified optimal cut-off values for each 2D measure with high specificity and sensitivity. The cut-off values for LVW, BCR, and CCI divided the MS patients into two subgroups, in which whole-brain and grey matter volume, EDSS, and processing speed were significantly different. Conclusion: LVW, BCR, and CCI with particular cut-off values are useful to discriminate MS patients with decreased brain volume, physical disability, and processing speed. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.</p>"
20,2-s2.0-85119426178,Multiple sclerosis impairment scale and brain MRI in secondary progressive multiple sclerosis,"<p>Objective: To examine the Multiple Sclerosis Impairment Scale (MSIS) in secondary progressive MS (SPMS) in relation to the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) outcomes, and mobility. Methods: In this observational single-center study, 68 secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS) patients were examined by MSIS, EDSS, functional mobility tests of upper/lower extremities, and multimodal MRI. Participants had EDSS ≥3.5, a decline in daily activities over the last year unrelated to relapses, and/or 6-month confirmed disability progression. Results: Mean disease duration was 23.1 ± 8.3 years and mean age 54.4 ± 8.1 years. MSIS, EDSS, and their corresponding motor, cerebellar, and sensory subscores correlated (p &lt;.0001). Motor subscores of MSIS correlated stronger with Timed-25-Foot-Walk (T25FW) than pyramidal functional system score (FSS) (p =.03), but EDSS had a stronger correlation to T25FW than the total MSIS score (p =.01). MSIS cerebellar subscore correlated stronger with 9-Hole Peg Test (9-HPT) than cerebellar FSS (p =.04). The sensory MSIS subscore also showed correlation with 9-HPT in contrast to sensory FSS (p =.006). MSIS subscores had stronger correlations with MRI volumetry measures than FSS scores (lesion volume and putamen, thalamus, corpus callosum volumetry, p =.0001–0.0017). Conclusion: In patients with SPMS, MSIS correlated with functional motor tests. MSIS showed stronger correlations with atrophy of central nervous system areas, and may be more sensitive to scale cerebellar and sensory function than EDSS. © 2021 John Wiley &amp; Sons A/S.

21,2-s2.0-85112446984,The clinical and paraclinical correlates of employment status in multiple sclerosis,"<p>Purpose: To identify the clinical and paraclinical markers of employment status in multiple sclerosis (MS). Methods: This was a cross-sectional sub-study investigating 1226 MS patients. To minimalized confounding effect, two groups of patients, matched by sex, age, and education, were selected: 307 patients with full time employment and 153 unemployed patients receiving disability pension. We explored associations between employment status and Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), 25 Foot Walk Test (25FWT), Nine Hole Peg Test (9HPT), Brief International Cognitive Assessment for MS (BICAMS), Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), SLOAN charts (SLOAN), and brain volumetric MRI measures. Results: Both groups differed significantly on all variables of interest (p &lt; 0.001). In the univariate analyses, EDSS, SDMT (Symbol Digit Modalities Test) adjusted for BDI, 25FWT, and 9HPT best explained variability in vocational status. In multivariate analyses, the combination of EDSS, 25FWT, SDMT, BDI, and corpus callosum fraction (CCF) explained the greatest variability. As a next step, after patients were matched by EDSS, differences in SDMT, 25FWT (both p &lt; 0.001), 9HPT, CCF, and T2 lesion volume were still present (all p &lt; 0.005) between both groups. The best multivariate model consisted of SDMT, BDI, and T2 lesion volume. Conclusions: EDSS, walking ability, cognitive performance, and MRI volumetric parameters are independently associated with employment status. © 2021, Fondazione Società Italiana di Neurologia.</p>"
22,2-s2.0-85112332412,Oligodendrocyte pathology in fetal alcohol spectrum disorders,"<p>The pathology of fetal alcohol syndrome and the less severe fetal alcohol spectrum disorders includes brain dysmyelination. Recent studies have shed light on the molecular mechanisms underlying these white matter abnormalities. Rodent models of fetal alcohol syndrome and human studies have shown suppressed oligodendrocyte differentiation and apoptosis of oligodendrocyte precursor cells. Ethanol exposure led to reduced expression of myelin basic protein and delayed myelin basic protein expression in rat and mouse models of fetal alcohol syndrome and in human histopathological specimens. Several studies have reported increased expression of many chemokines in dysmyelinating disorders in central nervous system, including multiple sclerosis and fetal alcohol syndrome. Acute ethanol exposure reduced levels of the neuroprotective insulin-like growth factor-1 in fetal and maternal sheep and in human fetal brain tissues, while ethanol increased the expression of tumor necrosis factor α in mouse and human neurons. White matter lesions have been induced in the developing sheep brain by alcohol exposure in early gestation. Rat fetal alcohol syndrome models have shown reduced axon diameters, with thinner myelin sheaths, as well as reduced numbers of oligodendrocytes, which were also morphologically aberrant oligodendrocytes. Expressions of markers for mature myelination, including myelin basic protein, also were reduced. The accumulating knowledge concerning the mechanisms of ethanol-induced dysmyelination could lead to the development of strategies to prevent dysmyelination in children exposed to ethanol during fetal development. Future studies using fetal oligodendrocyte- and oligodendrocyte precursor cell-derived exosomes isolated from the mother's blood may identify biomarkers for fetal alcohol syndrome and even implicate epigenetic changes in early development that affect oligodendrocyte precursor cell and oligodendrocyte function in adulthood. By combining various imaging modalities with molecular studies, it may be possible to determine which fetuses are at risk and to intervene therapeutically early in the pregnancy. © 2022 Wolters Kluwer Medknow Publications.

24,2-s2.0-85108335792,Characterization of multiple sclerosis neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration with relaxation and diffusion basis spectrum imaging,"<p>Background: Advanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) methods can provide more specific information about various microstructural tissue changes in multiple sclerosis (MS) brain. Quantitative measurement of T<sub>1</sub> and T<sub>2</sub> relaxation, and diffusion basis spectrum imaging (DBSI) yield metrics related to the pathology of neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration that occurs across the spectrum of MS. Objective: To use relaxation and DBSI MRI metrics to describe measures of neuroinflammation, myelin and axons in different MS subtypes. Methods: 103 participants (20 clinically isolated syndrome (CIS), 33 relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS), 30 secondary progressive MS and 20 primary progressive MS) underwent quantitative T<sub>1</sub>, T<sub>2</sub>, DBSI and conventional 3T MRI. Whole brain, normal-appearing white matter, lesion and corpus callosum MRI metrics were compared across MS subtypes. Results: A gradation of MRI metric values was seen from CIS to RRMS to progressive MS. RRMS demonstrated large oedema-related differences, while progressive MS had the most extensive abnormalities in myelin and axonal measures. Conclusion: Relaxation and DBSI-derived MRI measures show differences between MS subtypes related to the severity and composition of underlying tissue damage. RRMS showed oedema, demyelination and axonal loss compared with CIS. Progressive MS had even more evidence of increased oedema, demyelination and axonal loss compared with CIS and RRMS. © The Author(s), 2021.</p>"
25,2-s2.0-85124939482,Mitochondrial Neurodegeneration,"<p>Mitochondria are cytoplasmic organelles, which generate energy as heat and ATP, the universal energy currency of the cell. This process is carried out by coupling electron stripping through oxidation of nutrient substrates with the formation of a proton-based electrochemical gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane. Controlled dissipation of the gradient can lead to production of heat as well as ATP, via ADP phosphorylation. This process is known as oxidative phosphorylation, and is carried out by four multiheteromeric complexes (from I to IV) of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, carrying out the electron flow whose energy is stored as a proton-based electrochemical gradient. This gradient sustains a second reaction, operated by the mitochondrial ATP synthase, or complex V, which condensates ADP and Pi into ATP. Four complexes (CI, CIII, CIV, and CV) are composed of proteins encoded by genes present in two separate compartments: The nuclear genome and a small circular DNA found in mitochondria themselves, and are termed mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). Mutations striking either genome can lead to mitochondrial impairment, determining infantile, childhood or adult neurodegeneration. Mitochondrial disorders are complex neurological syndromes, and are often part of a multisystem disorder. In this paper, we divide the diseases into those caused by mtDNA defects and those that are due to mutations involving nuclear genes; from a clinical point of view, we discuss pediatric disorders in comparison to juvenile or adult-onset conditions. The complementary genetic contributions controlling organellar function and the complexity of the biochemical pathways present in the mitochondria justify the extreme genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity of this new area of inborn errors of metabolism known as ‘mitochondrial medicine’. © 2022 by the authors.</p>"
