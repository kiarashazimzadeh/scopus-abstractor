Methods: Among 550 people with a tentative diagnosis of MS or neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD), we selected patients, who met the 2010 McDonald diagnosis criteria for MS, but did not show abnormal findings on conventional brain and spinal cord MRI. After evaluating their clinical data, we analyzed fractional anisotropy (FA) values in the brain white matter on diffusion tensor MRIs and the frequencies of B-cell subsets in the peripheral blood in the corresponding cases as compared to healthy controls. Results: Eleven patients (age: 41.1 ± 8.0 years, 9 women and 2 men) met the selection criteria. They were functionally disabled, with a median expanded disability status scale score of 6.0 (2.0-8.0). CSF oligoclonal bands were negative in all cases. IV methylprednisolone and plasmapheresis (PP) were found to be efficacious. Diffusion tensor MRI analysis revealed extensive white matter abnormalities characterized by significantly decreased FA values. The frequency of plasmablasts in the peripheral blood was significantly increased in these patients similar to NMOSD. Conclusions: The neurologic disabilities in these patients could be ascribed to brain white matter damage, as revealed by MRI analysis, whereas the efficacy of PP and B-cell abnormalities in the patients suggested an autoimmune-mediated pathogenesis. In the differential diagnosis of MS, we propose that this condition be referred to as, ""Normal-appearing Imaging-associated, Neuroimmunologically Justified, Autoimmune encephalomyelitis"".

458,2-s2.0-85046701711,White matter microstructural alterations in clinically isolated syndrome and multiple sclerosis,"<p>This study aims to determine whether and how diffusion alteration occurs in the earliest stage of multiple sclerosis (MS) and the differences in diffusion metrics between CIS and MS by using the tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) method based on diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Thirty-six CIS patients (mean age ± SD: 34.0 years ± 12.6), 36 relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) patients (mean age ± SD: 35.0 years ± 9.4) and 36 age- and gender-matched normal controls (NCs) were included in this study. Voxel-wise analyses were performed with TBSS using multiple diffusion metrics, including fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (λ<sub>1</sub>) and radial diffusivity (λ<sub>23</sub>). In the CIS patients, TBSS analyses revealed diffusion alterations in a few white matter (WM) regions including the anterior thalamic radiation, corticospinal tract, inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, superior longitudinal fasciculus, body and splenium of the corpus callosum, internal capsule, external capsule, and cerebral peduncle. MS patients showed more widespread diffusion changes (decreased FA, increased λ<sub>1</sub>, λ<sub>23</sub> and MD) than CIS. Exploratory analyses also revealed the possible associations between WM diffusion metrics and clinical variables (Expanded Disability Status Scale and disease duration) in the patients. This study provided imaging evidence for DTI abnormalities in CIS and MS and suggested that DTI can improve our knowledge of the path physiology of CIS and MS and clinical progression. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd</p>"
459,2-s2.0-85045378710,Genetic detection of Sonic hedgehog (Shh) expression and cellular response in the progression of acute through chronic demyelination and remyelination,"<p>Multiple sclerosis is a demyelinating disease in which neurological deficits result from damage to myelin, axons, and neuron cell bodies. Prolonged or repeated episodes of demyelination impair remyelination. We hypothesized that augmenting Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling in chronically demyelinated lesions could enhance oligodendrogenesis and remyelination. Shh regulates oligodendrocyte development during postnatal myelination, and maintains adult neural stem cells. We used genetic approaches to detect Shh expression and Shh responding cells in vivo. Shh<sup>CreERT2</sup> or Gli1<sup>CreERT2</sup> mice were crossed to reporter mice for genetic fate-labeling of cells actively transcribing Shh or Gli1, an effective readout of canonical Shh signaling. Tamoxifen induction enabled temporal control of recombination at distinct stages of acute and chronic cuprizone demyelination of the corpus callosum. Gli1 fate-labeled cells were rarely found in the corpus callosum with tamoxifen given during acute demyelination stages to examine activated microglia, reactive astrocytes, or remyelinating cells. Gli1 fate-labeled cells, mainly reactive astrocytes, were observed in the corpus callosum with tamoxifen given after chronic demyelination. However, Shh expressing cells were not detected in the corpus callosum during acute or chronic demyelination. Finally, SAG, an agonist of both canonical and type II non-canonical Hedgehog signaling pathways, was microinjected into the corpus callosum after chronic demyelination. Significantly, SAG delivery increased proliferation and enhanced remyelination. SAG did not increase Gli1 fate-labeled cells in the corpus callosum, which may indicate signaling through the non-canonical Hedgehog pathway. These studies demonstrate that Hedgehog pathway interventions may have therapeutic potential to modulate astrogliosis and to promote remyelination after chronic demyelination. © 2018</p>"
460,2-s2.0-85042217584,Cuprizone Administration Alters the Iron Metabolism in the Mouse Model of Multiple Sclerosis,"<p>Cuprizone (CZ) is a widely used copper chelating agent to develop non-autoimmune animal model of multiple sclerosis, characterized by demyelination of the corpus callosum (CC) and other brain regions. The exact mechanisms of CZ action are still arguable, but it seems that the only affected cells are the mature oligodendrocytes, possibly via metabolic disturbances caused by copper deficiency. During the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis, high amount of deposited iron can be found throughout the demyelinated areas of the brain in the form of extracellular iron deposits and intracellularly accumulated iron in microglia. In the present study, we used the accepted experimental model of 0.2% CZ-containing diet with standard iron concentration to induce demyelination in the brain of C57BL/6 mice. Our aim was to examine the changes of iron homeostasis in the CC and as a part of the systemic iron regulation, in the liver. Our data showed that CZ treatment changed the iron metabolism of both tissues; however, it had more impact on the liver. Besides the alterations in the expressions of iron storage and import proteins, we detected reduced serum iron concentration and iron stores in the liver, together with elevated hepcidin levels and feasible disturbances in the Fe–S cluster biosynthesis. Our results revealed that the CZ-containing diet influences the systemic iron metabolism in mice, particularly the iron homeostasis of the liver. This inadequate systemic iron regulation may affect the iron homeostasis of the brain, eventually indicating a relationship among CZ treatment, iron metabolism, and neurodegeneration. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.</p>"

Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) osteopontin (OPN) and neurofilament light chain (NF-L) have been proposed as candidate surrogate markers of inflammatory and neurodegenerative processes in MS. Objective: To evaluate the relationship between CSF NF-L and OPN levels and brain grey and white matter volumes in patients with clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) suggestive of MS. Methods: A total of 41 CIS patients and 30 neurological controls (NCs) were included. CSF NF-L and OPN were measured by commercial ELISA. Measures of brain volume (normalized brain volume (NBV), normalized grey matter volume (NGV), peripheral grey matter volume (PGV), normalized white matter volume (WMV), and ventricular volume) were obtained by SIENAX. Corpus callosum index (CCI) was calculated. Brain volumes were categorized into ‘high’ and ‘low’ according to the median value. Results: CSF NF-L and OPN levels were higher in CIS patients in comparison with NCs. CIS patients with ‘low’ TGV, PGV, and TBV showed higher CSF NF-L levels than CIS patients with ‘high’ brain volumes. TGV and PGV correlated inversely with NF-L levels, whereas CCI was inversely related to OPN levels. CSF NF-L was the only independent predictor of TGV and PGV. Conclusion: CSF NF-L tracks mainly grey matter damage in patients with CIS suggestive of MS. © 2017, The Author(s).</p>"
462,2-s2.0-85061367424,Fingolimod enhances oligodendrocyte differentiation of transplanted human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neural progenitors,"<p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease which affects myelin in the central nervous system (CNS) and leads to serious disability. Currently available treatments for MS mainly suppress the immune system. Regenerative medicine-based approaches attempt to increase myelin repair by targeting endogenous progenitors or transplanting stem cells or their derivatives. Fingolimod exerts anti-inflammatory effects and directly affects neural cells. In this study we assessed the effect of fingolimod on transplanted human induced pluripotent stem cell derived neural progenitors (hiPSC-NPs). hiPSC-NPs were labeled by green fluorescence protein (GFP) and transplanted into the corpus callosum of mice which were chronically demyelinated after cuprizone (CPZ) feedings for 10 weeks. The animals received fingolimod from 1 day prior to NPs transplantation via gavage as well as daily intraperitoneal cyclosporine A from 2 days before cell transplantation until the time of sampling. At either 7 or 21 days after NPs transplantation, the animals were sacrificed and their brains were histologically evaluated for the number of transplanted cells and their fate. In the animals treated with fingolimod, we observed higher numbers of NPs within the injection site compared to the animals who did not receive fingolimod showing that hiPSC-NPs were more efficiently differentiated to the oligodendrocyte lineage. These data have suggested that repetitive treatment with fingolimod, beside its anti-inflammatory effect, may enhance the survival and differentiation of transplanted NPs to oligodendrocyte lineage cells to participate in myelin repair. © 2018, Iranian Journal of Pharmaceutical Research.

Myelin is enriched in lipids, and more specifically, oleic acid. The goal of this study was to evaluate the concentration of oleic acid following demyelination and remyelination in the cuprizone model, test if these changes occurred in specific lipid species, and whether differences in the cuprizone model correlate with changes observed in post-mortem human brains. Eight-week-old C57Bl/6 mice were fed a 0.2% cuprizone diet for 5 weeks and some animals allowed to recover for 11 days. Demyelination, inflammation, and lipid concentrations were measured in the corpus callosum. Standard fatty acid techniques and liquid chromatography combined with tandem mass spectrometry were performed to measure concentrations of fatty acids in total brain lipids and a panel of lipid species within the phosphatidylcholine (PC). Similar measurements were conducted in post-mortem brain tissues of multiple sclerosis patients and were compared to healthy controls. Five weeks of cuprizone administration resulted in demyelination followed by significant remyelination after 11 days of recovery. Compared to control, oleic acid was decreased after 5 weeks of cuprizone treatment and increased during the recovery phase. This decrease in oleic acid was associated with a specific decrease in the PC 36:1 pool. Similar results were observed in human post-mortem brains. Decreases in myelin content in the cuprizone model were accompanied by decreases in oleic acid concentration and is associated with PC 36:1 suggesting that specific lipids could be a potential biomarker for myelin degeneration. The biological relevance of oleic acid for disease progression remains to be verified. (Figure presented.). © 2018 International Society for Neurochemistry</p>"
464,2-s2.0-85047306657,Biochemically altered myelin triggers autoimmune demyelination,"<p>Although immune attack against central nervous system (CNS) myelin is a central feature of multiple sclerosis (MS), its root cause is unresolved. In this report, we provide direct evidence that subtle biochemical modifications to brain myelin elicit pathological immune responses with radiological and histological properties similar to MS lesions. A subtle myelinopathy induced by abbreviated cuprizone treatment, coupled with subsequent immune stimulation, resulted in lesions of inflammatory demyelination. The degree of myelin injury dictated the resulting immune response; biochemical damage that was too limited or too extensive failed to trigger overt pathology. An inhibitor of peptidyl arginine deiminases (PADs), enzymes that alter myelin structure and correlate with MS lesion severity, mitigated pathology even when administered only during the myelin-altering phase. Moreover, cultured splenocytes were reactive against donor myelin isolates, a response that was substantially muted when splenocytes were exposed to myelin from donors treated with PAD inhibitors. By showing that a primary biochemical myelinopathy can trigger secondary pathological inflammation, “cuprizone autoimmune encephalitis” potentially reconciles conflicting theories about MS pathogenesis and provides a strong rationale for investigating myelin as a primary target for early, preventative therapy. © 2018 National Academy of Sciences.

465,2-s2.0-85056477390,Brain connectivity and cognitive processing speed in multiple sclerosis: A systematic review,"<p>Background: Processing speed (PS) decline is the most commonly observed cognitive deficit in people with multiple sclerosis (MS) resulting in a significant impact on quality of life. Despite its importance, knowledge of the underlying neural substrates is lacking. Objective: As MS is increasingly recognised as a disconnection syndrome, our aim was to carry out a systematic literature review to clarify the relationship between PS performance and MRI measures of structural and functional brain connectivity in people with MS. Search methods: A literature search was carried out on PubMed and Web of Science that included publications predating September 2017. Additional articles were added after inspection of the reference lists of all selected papers. Data extraction: All selected papers were categorised in three sections according to the MRI measures investigated, independently or both. Quality assessment was carried out using a customised set of criteria. Results: Thirty-two articles met the inclusion criteria and were included in the review. Microstructural integrity of the anterior corpus callosum and functional connectivity of frontal areas were more consistently found to correlate with PS performance, though high variability of findings was observed across studies. Several methodological flaws emerged from the reviewed literature. Conclusions: Despite the observed trends, no definite conclusions can be drawn on the relationship between brain connectivity and PS decline in MS given the limitations of the current literature. Future investigations may benefit from theoretical and methodological advances to clarify how MS-related brain damage affects patients’ cognition. © 2018</p>"
466,2-s2.0-85043303282,Combining clinical and magnetic resonance imaging markers enhances prediction of 12-year employment status in multiple sclerosis patients,"<p>Background: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is frequently diagnosed in the most productive years of adulthood and is often associated with worsening employment status. However, reliable predictors of employment status change are lacking. Objective: To identify early clinical and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) markers of employment status worsening in MS patients at 12-year follow-up. Methods: A total of 145 patients with early relapsing-remitting MS from the original Avonex-Steroids-Azathioprine (ASA) study were included in this prospective, longitudinal, observational cohort study. Cox models were conducted to identify MRI and clinical predictors (at baseline and during the first 12 months) of worsening employment status (patients either (1) working full-time or part-time with no limitations due to MS and retaining this status during the course of the study, or (2) patients working full-time or part-time with no limitations due to MS and switching to being unemployed or working part-time due to MS). Results: In univariate analysis, brain parenchymal fraction, T1 and T2 lesion volume were the best MRI predictors of worsening employment status over the 12-year follow-up period. MS duration at baseline (hazard ratio (HR) = 1.10, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.03–1.18; p = 0.040) was the only significant clinical predictor. Having one extra milliliter of T1 lesion volume was associated with a 53% greater risk of worsening employment status (HR = 1.53, 95% CI 1.16–2.02; p = 0.018). A brain parenchymal fraction decrease of 1% increased the risk of worsening employment status by 22% (HR = 0.78, 95% CI 0.65–0.95; p = 0.034). Conclusion: Brain atrophy and lesion load were significant predictors of worsening employment status in MS patients. Using a combination of clinical and MRI markers may improve the early prediction of an employment status change over long-term follow-up. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.</p>"

Methods: We used the Corpus Callosum Index (CCI) obtained from best mid-sagittal T2/FLAIR or T1-weighted MRI at two time-points, more than one year apart. CCI has been mainly used in Multiple Sclerosis (MS), but not in epilepsy, so we tested the validity of our results performing a proof of concept cohort, incorporating MS patients with and without epilepsy. Then, we explored this measurement in a well-characterized and long-term cohort of patients with temporal lobe epilepsy associated with HS. Results: In the proof of concept cohort (MS without epilepsy n:40, and MS with epilepsy, n:15), we found a larger CCI atrophy rate in MS patients with poor epilepsy control vs. MS without epilepsy (p:0.01). Then, in HS patients (n:74), annualized CCI atrophy rate was correlated with the long-term Engel scale (Rho:0.31, p:0.007). In patients with post-surgical seizure recurrence, a larger CCI atrophy rate was found one year before any seizure relapse. Univariate analysis showed an increased risk of seizure recurrence in males, higher pre-surgical seizure frequency, necessity of invasive EEG monitoring, and higher CCI atrophy rate. Two of these variables were independent predictors in the multivariate analysis, male gender (HR:4.87, p:0.002) and CCI atrophy rate (HR:1.21, p:0.001). Conclusion: We demonstrated that atrophy of the corpus callosum, using the CCI, is related with poor seizure control in two different neurological disorders presenting with epilepsy, which might suggest that corpus callosum atrophy obtained in early post-surgical follow-up, could be a biomarker for predicting recurrences and guiding treatment plans. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.</p>"
470,2-s2.0-85054592329,In Vivo Optical Imaging of Myelination Events in a Myelin Basic Protein Promoter-Driven Luciferase Transgenic Mouse Model,"<p>The compact myelin sheath is important for axonal function, and its loss can lead to neuronal cell death and irreversible functional deficits. Myelin is vulnerable to a variety of metabolic, toxic, and autoimmune insults. In diseases like multiple sclerosis, there is currently no therapy to stop myelin loss, underscoring the need for neuroprotective and remyelinating therapies. Noninvasive, robust techniques are also needed to confirm the effect of such therapies in animal models. This article describes the generation, characterization, and potential uses for a myelin basic protein-luciferase (MBP-luci) transgenic mouse model, in which the firefly luciferase reporter gene is selectively controlled by the MBP promoter. In vivo bioluminescence imaging can be used to visualize and quantify demyelination and remyelination at the transcriptional level, noninvasively, and in real time. Transgenic mice were assessed in the cuprizone-induced model of demyelination, and luciferase activity highly correlated with demyelination and remyelination events as confirmed by both magnetic resonance imaging and postmortem histological analysis. Furthermore, MBP-luci mice demonstrated enhanced luciferase signal and remyelination in the cuprizone model after treatment with a peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-delta selective agonist and quetiapine. Imaging sensitivity was further enhanced by using CycLuc 1, a luciferase substrate, which has greater blood–brain barrier penetration. We demonstrated the utility of MBP-luci model in tracking myelin changes in real time and supporting target and therapeutic validation efforts. © The Author(s) 2018.</p>"

472,2-s2.0-85042177435,Changes in the axo-glial junctions of the optic nerves of cuprizone-treated mice,"<p>Demyelination induced by cuprizone in mice has served a useful model system for the study of demyelinating diseases, such as multiple sclerosis. Severity of demyelination by cuprizone, however, varies across different regions of the central nervous system; the corpus callosum is sensitive, while the optic nerves are resistant. Here, we investigated the effects of cuprizone on optic nerves, focusing on the axo-glial junctions. Immunostaining for sodium channels, contactin-associated protein, neurofascins, and potassium channels revealed that there were no massive changes in the density and morphology of the axo-glial junctions in cuprizone-treated optic nerves. However, when we counted the number of incomplete junctional complexes, we observed increased numbers of isolated paranodes. These isolated paranodes were immunopositive for both axonal and glial membrane proteins, indicating that they were the contact sites between axons and glia. These were not associated with sodium channels or potassium channels, suggesting the absence of physiological functions. When teased axons from cuprizone-treated optic nerves were immunostained, the isolated paranodes were found at the internode region of the myelin. From these observations, we conclude that cuprizone induces new contacts between axons and myelins at the internode region. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.</p>"
473,2-s2.0-85041732342,Differential local tissue permissiveness influences the final fate of GPR17-expressing oligodendrocyte precursors in two distinct models of demyelination,"<p>Promoting remyelination is recognized as a novel strategy to foster repair in neurodegenerative demyelinating diseases, such as multiple sclerosis. In this respect, the receptor GPR17, recently emerged as a new target for remyelination, is expressed by early oligodendrocyte precursors (OPCs) and after a certain differentiation stage it has to be downregulated to allow progression to mature myelinating oligodendrocytes. Here, we took advantage of the first inducible GPR17 reporter mouse line (GPR17-iCreER<sup>T2</sup>xCAG-eGFP mice) allowing to follow the final fate of GPR17<sup>+</sup> cells by tamoxifen-induced GFP-labeling to unveil the destiny of these cells in two demyelination models: experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), characterized by marked immune cell activation and inflammation, and cuprizone induced demyelination, where myelin dysfunction is achieved by a toxic insult. In both models, demyelination induced a strong increase of fluorescent GFP<sup>+</sup> cells at damaged areas. However, only in the cuprizone model reacting GFP<sup>+</sup> cells terminally differentiated to mature oligodendrocytes, thus contributing to remyelination. In EAE, GFP<sup>+</sup> cells were blocked at immature stages and never became myelinating oligodendrocytes. We suggest these strikingly distinct fates be due to different permissiveness of the local CNS environment. Based on previously reported GPR17 activation by emergency signals (e.g., Stromal Derived Factor-1), we propose that a marked inflammatory milieu, such as that reproduced in EAE, induces GPR17 overactivation resulting in impaired downregulation, untimely and prolonged permanence in OPCs, leading, in turn, to differentiation blockade. Combined treatments with remyelinating agents and anti-inflammatory drugs may represent new potential adequate strategies to halt neurodegeneration and foster recovery. © 2018 The Authors GLIA Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p>"
474,2-s2.0-85041110098,Diffusion Kurtosis Imaging Shows Similar Cerebral Axonal Damage in Patients with HIV Infection and Multiple Sclerosis,"<p>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: In this pilot study, we sought to investigate the pathological changes in the white matter (WM) of medically complex, combination antiretroviral therapy (cART)-treated patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), comparing them to patients with long-standing, secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS). METHODS: Using diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI)-derived WM tract integrity (WMTI) metrics, 15 HIV and 15 age- and sex-matched SPMS patients with similar disease duration underwent magnetic resonance imaging analysis. Maps of WMTI metrics were created. Tract-based spatial statistics analysis of the whole brain and regions of interest analysis of the corpus callosum (CC) and the anterior thalamic radiations (ATRs) were performed and the derived WMTI metrics were compared between the groups of patients. RESULTS: Axonal water fraction, an index of chronic axonal loss, showed similarities between HIV and the chronic MS patients in all regions; in contrast, tortuosity, a measure more sensitive to myelin loss, was regionally variable. In addition, in HIV patients, WMTI metrics of the CC and left ATR were associated with cognitive test scores, suggesting clinical relevance for these measures of WM damage. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that DKI-derived WMTI metrics may be a valuable tool in assessing the WM changes of medically complex HIV-infected individuals. While not powered to examine potential etiologies of WM changes in this pilot sample, regional variations in WMTI metrics were seen. When contrasted with changes consequent to chronic MS of similar duration, HIV and its comorbidities appear to result in similar degrees of axonal damage, but regionally variable amounts of myelin loss and extraxonal abnormality.

475,2-s2.0-85031116690,MEDI+0: Morphology enabled dipole inversion with automatic uniform cerebrospinal fluid zero reference for quantitative susceptibility mapping,"<p>Purpose: To develop a quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) method with a consistent zero reference using minimal variation in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) susceptibility. Theory and Methods: The ventricular CSF was automatically segmented on the R<sub>2</sub><sup>*</sup> map. An L<sub>2</sub>-regularization was used to enforce CSF susceptibility homogeneity within the segmented region, with the averaged CSF susceptibility as the zero reference. This regularization for CSF homogeneity was added to the model used in a prior QSM method (morphology enabled dipole inversion [MEDI]). Therefore, the proposed method was referred to as MEDI+0 and compared with MEDI in a numerical simulation, in multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions, and in a reproducibility study in healthy subjects. Results: In both the numerical simulations and in vivo experiments, MEDI+0 not only decreased the susceptibility variation within the ventricular CSF, but also suppressed the artifact near the lateral ventricles. In the simulation, MEDI+0 also provided more accurate quantification compared to MEDI in the globus pallidus, substantia nigra, corpus callosum, and internal capsule. MEDI+0 measurements of MS lesion susceptibility were in good agreement with those obtained by MEDI. Finally, both MEDI+0 and MEDI showed good and similar intrasubject reproducibility. Conclusion: QSM with a minimal variation in ventricular CSF is viable to provide a consistent zero reference while improving image quality.

476,2-s2.0-85043588879,Lesion accumulation is predictive of long-term cognitive decline in multiple sclerosis,"<p>Objective: To investigate the long-term progression of cognitive dysfunction and its neuroanatomical correlates and predictors in multiple sclerosis (MS). Methods: A cohort of 37 MS patients reflecting five decades of disease duration and all subtypes was followed over 17.5 years. Matched controls were recruited at the last follow-up. Global cognitive functioning was assessed using a principal component cognitive index based on comprehensive neuropsychological testing. During the last 8.5 years of the study, brain MRI was performed to analyze normalized volumetrics of three global tissue compartments (white and gray matter, lesions) and strategic regions (corpus callosum, thalamus, hippocampus). Results: Cognitive decline progressed continuously throughout the study paralleled by atrophy and lesion accumulation. The cognitive index partly correlated with Expanded Disability Status Scale (ρ = −0.47, p &lt; 0.001) and was mainly associated with the lesion fraction (β = −0.48, p &lt; 0.001) and callosal fraction (β = 0.39, p = 0.002) in multiple linear regression analysis. The lesion fraction was an independent predictor of the cognitive performance 8.5 years later (β = −0.35, p = 0.008). Symbol Digit Modalities Test was most frequently abnormal (40%), while Rey–Osterrieth Complex Figure Test was more sensitive to detect cognitive decline. Conclusions: Cognitive impairment progresses continuously in MS, associated with atrophy and lesion accumulation, suggesting that interventions targeting these processes could be beneficial at all disease stages. Widespread cognitive functions are more profoundly affected, associated with lesions and corpus callosal atrophy, supporting the idea of an underlying disconnection mechanism for cognitive decline in MS. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.</p>"
477,2-s2.0-85043340046,Composite MRI measures and short-term disability in patients with clinically isolated syndrome suggestive of MS,"<p>Background: The use of composite magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures has been suggested to better explain disability in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). However, little is known about the utility of composite scores at the earliest stages of the disease. Objective: To investigate whether, in patients with clinically isolated syndrome (CIS), a composite MRI measure, rather than the single metrics, would explain conversion to MS and would better correlate with disability at baseline and at 1 year of follow-up. Methods: Corticospinal tract (CST), corpus callosum (CC) and optic radiation (OR) volume, fractional anisotropy (FA), and mean diffusivity (MD) values were measured in 27 CIS patients and 24 healthy controls (HCs). Z-scores of FA, MD, and tract volume measures were calculated in patients, based on the corresponding measures obtained from HCs, and then combined in a composite score for each tract. Correlations between Z-scores at baseline and both the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) at baseline and at follow-up (FU-EDSS) were investigated. Results: Only CST, CC, and OR composite scores as well as the CST volume were significantly associated with FU-EDSS (p = 0.005, p = 0.007, p = 0.020, and p = 0.010, respectively). Conclusion: The combination of MRI measures rather than the individual metrics better captured the association between tissue damage in both the CC, OR and CST and short-term follow-up disability. © 2017, © The Author(s), 2017.</p>"
478,2-s2.0-85042104803,Susac syndrome misdiagnosed as multiple sclerosis with exacerbation by interferon beta therapy,"<p>Susac syndrome is a rare autoimmune disorder characterised by the clinical triad of encephalopathy, retinopathy (branch retinal artery occlusions) and hearing loss. The diagnosis of Susac syndrome may be difficult initially, and it is not uncommon for patients with Susac syndrome to be misdiagnosed with multiple sclerosis. In this case report, we describe a patient who was diagnosed as having multiple sclerosis for three years, with further deterioration after starting treatment with interferon beta-1a. The patient had the triad of encephalopathy, branch retinal artery occlusions and sensorineural hearing loss. She had the classic magnetic resonance imaging appearance, with normal magnetic resonance imaging of the spinal cord and absence of oligoclonal bands in the cerebrospinal fluid. Our patient responded well to treatment with a combination therapy and discontinuation of interferon beta-1a. Our observations raise awareness about the importance of the early and correct diagnosis of Susac syndrome, which usually affects young patients, with an excellent prognosis if treated aggressively at an early stage of the disease. Susac syndrome is underdiagnosed and is not uncommonly misdiagnosed as multiple sclerosis. Susac syndrome is a great mimicker of multiple sclerosis, and establishing diagnostic criteria for this syndrome is very useful. In any patient presenting with a progressive disabling neurological disorder associated with callosal lesions and/or hearing loss, and/or visual loss especially in women, Susac syndrome should be suspected. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.</p>"
479,2-s2.0-85041744032,Structural MRI correlates of cognitive function in multiple sclerosis,"<p>Background: Cognitive impairment (CI) has been associated with numerous magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) indices in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. In this study we investigated the association of a large set of 2D and 3D MRI markers with cognitive function in MS. Methods: A sample of 61 RRMS patients (mean age 41.8 ± 10.6 years old, 44 women, mean disease duration 137.9 ± 83.9 months) along with 51 age and gender matched healthy controls was used in this cross-sectional study. Neuropsychological and other tests, along with a large set of 2D/3D MRI evaluations were made. Results: 44.3% of patients had CI. CI patients had more disability, physical fatigue than non-CI patients and more psychological distress than non-CI patients and HCs. Also, CI patients had significantly larger third ventricle width and volume, smaller coprus callosum index and larger lesion volume than non-CI patients. These MRI markers also significantly predicted cognitive scores after adjusting for age and education, explaining about 30.6% of the variance of the total cognitive score. Conclusions: Selected linear and volumetric MRI indices predict cognitive function in MS. Future studies should expand these results by exploring longitudinal changes and producing normative data. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.</p>"
480,2-s2.0-85043452033,Experimental demyelination and axonal loss are reduced in MicroRNA-146a deficient mice,"<p>Background: The cuprizone (CPZ) model of multiple sclerosis (MS) was used to identify microRNAs (miRNAs) related to in vivo de- and remyelination. We further investigated the role of miR-146a in miR-146a-deficient (KO) mice: this miRNA is differentially expressed in MS lesions and promotes differentiation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) during remyelination, but its role has not been examined during demyelination. Methods: MicroRNAs were examined by Agilent Mouse miRNA Microarray in the corpus callosum during CPZ-induced demyelination and remyelination. Demyelination, axonal loss, changes in number of oligodendrocytes, OPCs, and macrophages/microglia was compared by histology/immunohistochemistry between KO and WT mice. Differential expression of target genes and proteins of miR-146a was analyzed in the transcriptome (4 × 44K Agilent Whole Mouse Genome Microarray) and proteome (liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry) of CPZ-induced de- and remyelination in WT mice. Levels of proinflammatory molecules in the corpus callosum were compared in WT versus KO mice by Meso Scale Discovery multiplex protein analysis. Results: miR-146a was increasingly upregulated during CPZ-induced de- and remyelination. The absence of miR-146a in KO mice protected against demyelination, axonal loss, body weight loss, and atrophy of thymus and spleen. The number of CNP<sup>+</sup> oligodendrocytes was increased during demyelination in the miR-146a KO mice, while there was a trend of increased number of NG2<sup>+</sup> OPCs in the WT mice. miR-146a target genes, SNAP25 and SMAD4, were downregulated in the proteome of demyelinating corpus callosum in WT mice. Higher levels of SNAP25 were measured by ELISA in the corpus callosum of miR-146a KO mice, but there was no difference between KO and WT mice during demyelination. Multiplex protein analysis of the corpus callosum lysate revealed upregulated TNF-RI, TNF-RII, and CCL2 in the WT mice in contrast to KO mice. The number of Mac3<sup>+</sup> and Iba1<sup>+</sup> macrophages/microglia was reduced in the demyelinating corpus callosum of the KO mice. Conclusion: During demyelination, absence of miR-146a reduced inflammatory responses, demyelination, axonal loss, the number of infiltrating macrophages, and increased the number of myelinating oligodendrocytes. The number of OPCs was slightly higher in the WT mice during remyelination, indicating a complex role of miR-146a during in vivo de- and remyelination. © 2018 Martin, Molnar, Szilagyi, Elkjaer, Nawrocki, Okarmus, Wlodarczyk, Thygesen, Palkovits, Gallyas, Larsen, Lassmann, Benedikz, Owens, Svenningsen and Illes.</p>"
481,2-s2.0-85045725712,Phase II Randomized Controlled Trial of Constraint-Induced Movement Therapy in Multiple Sclerosis. Part 2: Effect on White Matter Integrity,"<p>Background. Constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT) is a method of physical rehabilitation that has demonstrated clinical efficacy in patients with chronic stroke, cerebral palsy, and multiple sclerosis (MS). Objective. This pilot randomized controlled trial tested whether CIMT can also induce increases in white matter integrity in patients with MS. Methods. Twenty adults with chronic hemiparetic MS were randomized to receive either CIMT or complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) treatment (reported in the first article of this pair). Structural white matter change was assessed by tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS); measures included fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (AD), and radial diffusivity (RD). Results. CIMT and CAM groups did not differ in pretreatment disability or expectancy to benefit. As noted in the companion paper, the motor activity log (MAL) improved more after CIMT than CAM (P &lt;.001); the within-group effect size for CIMT was 3.7 (large d′ = 0.57), while for CAM it was just 0.7. Improvements in white matter integrity followed CIMT and were observed in the contralateral corpus callosum (FA, P &lt;.05), ipsilateral superior occipital gyrus (AD, P &lt;.05), ipsilateral superior temporal gyrus (FA, P &lt;.05), and contralateral corticospinal tract (MD and RD, P &lt;.05). Conclusion. CIMT produced a very large improvement in real-world limb use and induced white matter changes in patients with hemiparetic MS when compared with CAM. The findings suggest in preliminary fashion that the adverse changes in white matter integrity induced by MS might be reversed by CIMT.

482,2-s2.0-85044733122,Evaluation of the nmosd 2015 imaging guideline to differentiate between diagnosis of multiple sclerosis and neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder in Thai patients,"<p>Background &amp; Objective: The neuromyelitis optic spectrum disorders (NMOSD) diagnostic criteria introduced in 2015 proposed many imaging criteria to differentiate between NMOSD and multiple sclerosis (MS). Criteria applied in Asian population with higher prevalence of NMOSD might not be as specific. The objective was to evaluate the NMOSD 2015 imaging guideline in Thai patients. Methods: The patients were recruited from MS and Related Disorders Clinic at a university hospital. NMOSD 2015 and McDonald 2010 diagnostic criteria were applied for diagnosis. NMOSD was classified into positive- and negative-AQP4 groups.The MRI available in the institute PAC system was reviewed by 3 neuroradiologists for features according to NMOSD 2015 imaging criteria. Percentage of each finding was calculated in all groups. Results: There were 37 MS and 101 NMOSD patients, with positive- and negative-AQP4 NMOSD in 88 and 13 cases, respectively. Most of the patients were female. Findings in brain MRI suggestive of MS were Dawson finger sign, periventricular inferior temporal lobe and corticospinal tract lesions. Involvement of corpus callosum and optic pathway was more common in MS. More patients with NMOSD showed involvement at posterior half of the optic nerve, whereas more patients with MS had involvement of optic radiation and optic tract. Spinal cord lesions more common in NMOSD included thoracic cord involvement, lesions extending more than 3 vertebral body segments and centrally located lesions in axial plane. Conclusion: Only some brain MRI features were more conclusive for NMOSD in Thai patients. Spinal cord MRI lesions were still more helpful in differentiating between MS and NMOSD. © 2018, ASEAN Neurological Association. All rights reserved.</p>"
483,2-s2.0-85044326423,Prediction of conversion from clinically isolated syndrome to multiple sclerosis according to baseline characteristics: A prospective study,"<p>Objective: Clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) is a clinical state that proceeds with inflammation and demyelination, suggestive of multiple sclerosis (MS) in the central nervous system in the absence of other alternative diagnoses. The purpose of this study was to determine in a prospective cohort, the predictor factors in conversion from CIS to MS on the basis of clinical, magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) findings. Methods: Forty-one CIS patients were included in this study and followed up for at least two years. Results: Clinically, polysymptomatic or sensorial involvement, good prognostic factors and complete response to pulse therapy were found to be of prognostic value in conversion to MS. A greater presence of oligoclonal bands in CSF was identified in the converted group (92.8%). In terms of localization, presence of callosal lesion (71.4%), periventricular lesion (97.1%), Gd-enhanced lesion (48.6%), black hole (54.2%) and brainstem lesion (57.1%) was statistically significant in terms of conversion to MS.

484,2-s2.0-85043364392,Quantitative analysis of lipid debris accumulation caused by cuprizone induced myelin degradation in different CNS areas,"<p>Degradation of myelin sheath is thought to be the cause of neurodegenerative diseases, such as multiple sclerosis (MS), but definitive agreement on mechanism of how myelin is lost is currently lacking. Autoimmune initiation of MS has been recently questioned by proposing that the immune response is a consequence of oligodendrocyte degeneration. To study the process of myelin breakdown, we induced demyelination with cuprizone and applied coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) microscopy, a non-destructive label-free method to image lipid structures in living tissue. We confirmed earlier results showing a brain region dependent myelin destructive effect of cuprizone. In addition, high resolution in situ CARS imaging revealed myelin debris forming lipid droplets alongside myelinated axon fibers. Quantification of lipid debris with a custom-made software for segmentation and three dimensional reconstruction revealed brain region dependent accumulation of lipid drops inversely correlated to the thickness of myelin sheaths. Finally, we confirmed that in situ CARS imaging is applicable to living human brain tissue in brain slices derived from a patient. Thus, CARS microscopy is potent tool for quantitative monitoring of myelin degradation at unprecedented spatiotemporal resolution during oligodendrocyte damage. We think that accumulation of lipid drops around degrading myelin might be instrumental in triggering subsequent inflammatory processes. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.</p>"
485,2-s2.0-85021381939,Effect of myelin water exchange on DTI-derived parameters in diffusion MRI: Elucidation of TE dependence,"<p>Purpose: Water exchange exists between different neuronal compartments of brain tissue but is often ignored in most diffusion models. The goal of the current study was to demonstrate the dependence of diffusion measurements on echo time (TE) in the human brain and to investigate the underlying effects of myelin water exchange. Methods: Five healthy subjects were examined with single-shot pulsed-gradient spin-echo echo-planar imaging with fixed duration (δ) and separation (Δ) of diffusion gradient pulses and a set of varying TEs. The effects of water exchange and intrinsic T<sub>2</sub> difference in cellular environments were investigated with Monte Carlo simulations. Results: Both in vivo measurements and simulations showed that fractional anisotropy (FA) and axial diffusivity (AD) had positive correlations with TE, while radial diffusivity (RD) showed a negative correlation, which is consistent with a previous study. The simulation results further indicated the sensitivity of TE dependence to the change of g-ratio. Conclusion: The exchange between myelin and intra/extra-axonal water pools often plays a non-negligible role in the observed TE dependence of diffusion parameters, which may accompany or alter the effect of intrinsic T<sub>2</sub> in causing such dependence. The TE dependence may potentially serve as a biomarker for demyelination processes (e.g., in multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease).

486,2-s2.0-85049208215,Brain region-specific enhancement of remyelination and prevention of demyelination by the CSF1R kinase inhibitor BLZ945,"<p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory disease affecting the central nervous system (CNS). While multiple effective immunomodulatory therapies for MS exist today, they lack the scope of promoting CNS repair, in particular remyelination. Microglia play a pivotal role in regulating myelination processes, and the colony-stimulating factor 1 (CSF-1) pathway is a key regulator for microglia differentiation and survival. Here, we investigated the effects of the CSF-1 receptor kinase inhibitor, BLZ945, on central myelination processes in the 5-week murine cuprizone model by non-invasive and longitudinal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and histology. Therapeutic 2-week BLZ945 treatment caused a brain region-specific enhancement of remyelination in the striatum/cortex, which was absent in the corpus callosum/external capsule. This beneficial effect correlated positively with microglia reduction, increased oligodendrocytes and astrogliosis. Prophylactic BLZ945 treatment prevented excessive demyelination in the corpus callosum by reducing microglia and increasing oligondendrocytes. In the external capsule oligodendrocytes were depleted but not microglia and a buildup of myelin debris and axonal damage was observed. A similar microglial dysfunction in the external capsule with an increase of myelin debris was obvious in triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) knock-out mice treated with cuprizone. Finally, therapeutic BLZ945 treatment did not change the disease course in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis mice, a peripherally driven neuroinflammation model. Taken together, our data suggest that a short-term therapeutic inhibition of the CSF-1 receptor pathway by BLZ945 in the murine cuprizone model enhances central remyelination by modulating neuroinflammation. Thus, microglia-modulating therapies could be considered clinically for promoting myelination in combination with standard-of-care treatments in MS patients.</p>"
487,2-s2.0-85043519018,Mild myelin disruption elicits early alteration in behavior and proliferation in the subventricular zone,"<p>Myelin, the insulating sheath around axons, supports axon function. An important question is the impact of mild myelin disruption. In the absence of the myelin protein proteolipid protein (PLP1), myelin is generated but with age, axonal function/maintenance is disrupted. Axon disruption occurs in Plp1-null mice as early as 2 months in cortical projection neurons. High-volume cellular quantification techniques revealed a region-specific increase in oligodendrocyte density in the olfactory bulb and rostral corpus callosum that increased during adulthood. A distinct proliferative response of progenitor cells was observed in the subventricular zone (SVZ), while the number and proliferation of parenchymal oligodendrocyte progenitor cells was unchanged. This SVZ proliferative response occurred prior to evidence of axonal disruption. Thus, a novel SVZ response contributes to the region-specific increase in oligodendrocytes in Plp1-null mice. Young adult Plp1-null mice exhibited subtle but substantial behavioral alterations, indicative of an early impact of mild myelin disruption. © Serroukh et al.</p>"

The aim of this study was to quantify the development of cervical cord atrophy and to evaluate its association with disability progression in patients with primary-progressive multiple sclerosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-one patients with primary-progressive multiple sclerosis underwent 1.5T brain and spinal cord MR imaging at baseline and 6 –7 years later. The cervical spinal cord from C1 to C5 was segmented to evaluate the normalized overall cross-sectional area and the cross-sectional area of C2–C3, C3–C4, and C4 –C5. The annualized rates of normalized cross-sectional area loss were also evaluated. To estimate clinical progression, we determined the Expanded Disability Status Scale score at baseline and at 2 and 14 years after baseline to compute the normalized area under the curve of the Expanded Disability Status Scale and the Expanded Disability Status Scale changes from baseline to the follow-up time points. Associations between the cord cross-sectional area and brain MR imaging and clinical measures were also investigated. Finally, the value of all these measures for predicting long-term disability was evaluated. RESULTS: Some normalized cross-sectional area measurements showed moderate correlations with the normalized area under the curve of the Expanded Disability Status Scale, ranging from 0.439 to 0.359 (P .05). Moreover, the annualized rate of the normalized mean cross-sectional area loss and the baseline Expanded Disability Status Scale were independent predictors of long-term disability progression. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that development of cervical cord atrophy is associated with progression of disability and is predictive of this event in patients with primary-progressive MS.</p>"

However, further validation of its correlation with volumetric measurements is still warranted. Objective: To assess the correlation of the CCI with the corpus callosum volume (CCV), brain and lesion volumes, and level of disability in MS. Methods: Cross-sectional, exploratory study including patients with relapsing-remitting MS. Clinical assessment comprised of physical and cognitive disability scales. MRI parameters included conventional volumetric measurements, the CCI (manual), and the CCV (automated). Results: Twenty-four patients were included. There was a strong correlation between the CCI and CCV. The CCI correlated strongly with the white matter and lesion volumes, and moderately with the whole brain volume and scores on the Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test and MS Functional Composite. There were no correlations between the CCI and either gray matter volume or scores on the Expanded Disability Status Scale, the 9-Hole Peg Test, or the Timed 25-Foot Walk test.

However, LPA and its signaling in the brain are still poorly understood. In the present study, we revealed that the LPA5 receptor expression in corpus callosum elevated after the initiation of demyelination, and the hyperalgesia through Aδ-fibers following cuprizone-induced demyelination was mediated by LPA5 signaling. These data suggest that LPA5 signaling may play a key role in the mechanisms underlying neuropathic pain following demyelination in the brain. © 2018 The Authors</p>"

Antibodies against myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein were initially detected in children with demyelinating syndromes, and more recently reported in a broad spectrum of central nervous system demyelinating diseases in adults, including neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders and bilateral optic neuritis. Patients with myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody-associated demyelination appear to have unique clinical and radiological features. To the best of our knowledge a series of Italian patients with optic neuritis and positivity to myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibodies has not yet been reported and the paper on myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibodies are more focused on clinical features, diagnosis and outcome than on the radiological appearance, so we want to retrospectively report magnetic resonance imaging features of a group of eight patients, who came to our Ophthalmologic Emergency Department for optic neuritis and were found seropositive for myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibodies, comparing our data with the findings described in the literature. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.</p>"
494,2-s2.0-85039981291,On the role of the amygdala for experiencing fatigue in patients with multiple sclerosis,"<p>Background Recently, we proposed a model explaining the origin of fatigue in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. This model assumes that the feeling of fatigue results from inflammation-induced information processing within interoceptive brain areas. Objectives To investigate the association between self-reported cognitive fatigue and structural integrity of interoceptive brain areas in MS patients. Methods 95 MS patients and 28 healthy controls participated in this study. All participants underwent diffusion tensor MRI and fractional anisotropy data were calculated for the amygdala, the stria terminalis and the corpus callosum, a non-interoceptive brain area. Based on the cognitive fatigue score of the Fatigue Scale for Motor and Cognition, patients were divided into moderately cognitively fatigued (cognitive fatigue score ≥ 28) and cognitively non-fatigued (cognitive fatigue score &lt; 28) MS patients. Healthy controls were recruited as a third group. Repeated measures analyses of covariance, controlling for age, depression and brain atrophy, were performed to investigate whether the factor Group had a significant effect on the fractional anisotropy data. Results A significant effect of Group was observed for the amygdala (F = 3.389, p = 0.037). MS patients without cognitive fatigue presented lower values of the amygdala than MS patients with cognitive fatigue and healthy controls. For the stria terminalis and the corpus callosum, no main effect of Group was observed. Conclusion The structural integrity of the amygdala in non-fatigued MS patients appears to be reduced. According to our model this might indicate that the absence of fatigue in non-fatigued MS patients might result from disturbed inflammation-induced information processing in the amygdala. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.</p>"

ALSP was previously recognized as two distinct entities, hereditary diffuse leukoencephalopathy with spheroids (HDLS) and pigmentary orthochromatic leukodystrophy (POLD). However, recent identification of mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of the colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) gene, which regulates mononuclear cell lineages including microglia, have provided genetic and mechanistic evidence that POLD and HDLS should be regarded as a single clinicopathologic entity. We describe two illustrative cases of ALSP which presented with neuropsychiatric symptoms, progressive cognitive decline, and motor and gait disturbances. Antemortem diagnoses of autopsy-confirmed ALSP vary significantly, and include primary progressive multiple sclerosis, frontotemporal dementia, Alzheimer disease, atypical cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL), corticobasal syndrome, and atypical Parkinson disease, suggesting that ALSP may be significantly underdiagnosed. This article presents a systematic review of ALSP in the context of two illustrative cases to help integrate the literature on HDLS and POLD. Consistent use of the term ALSP is suggested for clarity in the literature going forward. © 2017</p>"
496,2-s2.0-85031088076,Alpha-lipoic acid mitigates toxic-induced demyelination in the corpus callosum by lessening of oxidative stress and stimulation of polydendrocytes proliferation,"<p>Multiple Sclerosis (MS), is a disease that degenerates myelin in central nervous system (CNS). Reactive oxygen species (ROSs) are toxic metabolites, and accumulating data indicate that ROSs-mediated apoptosis of oligodendrocytes (OLGs) plays a major role in the pathogenesis of MS under oxidative stress conditions. In this study, we investigated the role of endogenous antioxidant alpha-lipoic acid (ALA) as ROSs scavenger in the OLGs loss and myelin degeneration during cuprizone (cup)-induced demyelination in the experimental model of MS. Our results have shown that ALA treatment significantly increased population of mature OLGs (MOG<sup>+</sup> cells), as well as decreased oxidative stress (ROSs, COX-2 and PGE2) and apoptosis mediators (caspase-3 and Bax/Bcl2 ratio) in corpus callosum (CC). Surprisingly, ALA significantly stimulates population of NG2 chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan positive glia (NG2<sup>+</sup> cells or polydendrocytes), from week 4 afterward. Accordingly ALA could prevents apoptosis, delays demyelination and recruits OLGs survival and regeneration mechanisms in CC. We conclude that ALA has protective effects against toxic demyelination via reduction of redox signaling, and alleviation of polydendrocytes vulnerability to excitotoxic challenge. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.</p>"
497,2-s2.0-85026306869,Diffusion tensor imaging in multiple sclerosis at different final outcomes,"<p>Objectives: Methods to evaluate the relative contributions of demyelination vs axonal degeneration over the long-term course of MS are urgently needed. We used magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to estimate degrees of demyelination and axonal degeneration in the corpus callosum (CC) in cases of MS with different final outcomes. Materials and methods: We determined DTI measures mean diffusivity (MD), fractional anisotropy (FA), and axial (AD) and radial (RD) diffusivities in the CC of 31 MS patients, of whom 13 presented a secondary progressive course, 11 a non-progressive course, and seven a monophasic course. The study participants were survivors from an incidence cohort of 254 attack-onset MS patients with 50 years of longitudinal follow-up. As reference, we included five healthy individuals without significant morbidity. Results: In patients with secondary progression, compared to all other groups, the corpus callosum showed increased RD and reduced FA, but no change in AD. None of the parameters exhibited differences among non-progressive and monophasic course groups and controls. Conclusion: Increased RD was observed in secondary progressive MS, indicating significant myelin loss. Normal RD values observed in the clinically isolated syndrome and non-progressive groups confirm their benign nature. AD was not a characterizing parameter for long-term outcome. Demyelination revealed by increased RD is a distinguishing trait for secondary progression. © 2017 John Wiley &amp; Sons A/S. Published by John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd</p>"
498,2-s2.0-85053352808,"Surfen, a proteoglycan binding agent, reduces inflammation but inhibits remyelination in murine models of Multiple Sclerosis","<p>Proteoglycans are promising therapeutic targets in Multiple Sclerosis (MS), because they regulate many aspects of the immune response. This was studied using surfen, an agent that binds both heparan sulphate proteoglycans (HSPGs) and chondroitin sulphate proteoglycans (CSPGs). Initial cell culture work on bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDMs) found that surfen reduced concentrations of the chemokines CCL2, CCL4 and CCL5, with reduced messenger (m)RNA expression for Tumor Necrosis Factor, IL-6, IL-1β and inducible nitric oxide synthase. These data were further explored using Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis (EAE) in mice. Surfen reduced clinical signs during EAE when administered from disease onset, and reduced infiltration by CD4 positive T cells and macrophages into the central nervous system. These mice also showed reduced mRNA expression for the chemokines CCL3 and CCL5, with reduced concentrations of CCL2, CCL3 and CCL5. During EAE, surfen treatment induced a persistent increase in Interleukin (IL)-4 concentrations which may enhance T helper 2 responses. During EAE, surfen treatment reduced mRNA expression for HSPGs (NDST1, agrin, syndecan-4, perlecan, serglycin, syndecan-1) and the CSPG versican. By contrast, surfen increased mRNA expression for the CSPG aggrecan, with no effect on neurocan. During EAE, significant positive correlations were found between mRNA expression and clinical score for syndecan-4, serglycin and syndecan-1 and a significant negative correlation for aggrecan. These correlations were absent in surfen treated mice. Repair in the later stages of MS involves remyelination, which was modeled by injecting lysolecithin (lysophosphatidylcholine, LPC) into mouse corpus callosum to create regions of demyelination. When surfen was injected 2 days after LPC, it delayed remyelination of the lesions, but had no effect when injected 7 days after LPC. The delayed remyelination was associated with local increases in CSPG expression. Therefore surfen suppresses inflammation but inhibits remyelination in these models. A mechanism in common may be increased CSPG expression.</p>"

Lesions have been observed in different regions of the brain including, corpus callosum, neocortex and the hippocampal formation. The current study explored the role of Moringa oleifera leaf extract in restoring the resultant histomorphological changes in cuprizone-induced hippocampal damage in Wistar rats. Twenty adult female Wistar rats with average weight of 163.74 ± 3.59 g were grouped into A: Control, administered with 1 ml of normal saline, B: received 0.4% cuprizone diet, C: received 1.875 mg/ml/day of Moringa extract, and D: received a combination of cuprizone and Moringa in similar doses. Administration was oral for 5 weeks. The weights of animals were assessed during treatment, and at the termination of experiment, the rats were euthanized and the brains were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. The tissue was processed for histological and histochemical examinations using the Haematoxylin and Eosin stain and cresyl fast violet stain to assess the general microarchitecture and neuronal cells respectively of hippocampal cornu ammonis (CA) 3 region. The body weight of cuprizone-treated rats was reduced and this was ameliorated significantly in animals that were co-administered with Moringa. Similarly, there were histological alterations in the CA3 region of the hippocampus with the presence of pyknotic pyramidal cells organized in clusters and CA3 cells with degenerative changes, but administration of Moringa led to a better organised and fairly intact histological appearance.

Quantitative Magnetic Resonance Imaging (qMRI) enables a detailed characterization of brain tissue, but generates a large number of numerical results. In this study, we elucidated the main qMRI techniques and the brain regions that allow the identification of MS patients from neuroimaging data and pattern recognition techniques. Methods: The data came from the combination of computational tools of image processing and neuroimaging acquired in a 3 Tesla scanner using different techniques: Diffusion, T2 Relaxometry, Magnetization Transfer Ratio (MTR) and Structural Morphometry. Data from 126 brain regions of 203 healthy individuals and 124 MS patients were separated into two groups and processed in a data-mining program using the k-nearest-neighbor (KNN) algorithm. Results: The most relevant anatomical structures in the classification procedure were: corpus callosum, precuneus, left cerebellum and fusiform. Among the quantitative techniques the most relevant was the MTR, being indicated for longitudinal studies of this disease. KNN with 5 neighbors and pre-selected attributes had a better performance with an area under the ROC curve (97.3%) and accuracy (95.7%). A restricted classification considering only brain regions previously reported in the literature as affected by MS brought slightly lower scores, area: 97.1% and accuracy: 93.2%. Conclusion: The use of standard recognition techniques from quantitative neuroimaging techniques has confirmed that the white matter of the brain is the most affected tissue by MS following a global pattern with greater involvement of the left hemisphere. © 2018, Brazilian Society of Biomedical Engineering.

Increasing evidence has demonstrated that the inflammatory response triggers demyelination and gliosis in demyelinating disorders. Numerous clinical interventions, including those used to treat multiple sclerosis (MS), have confirmed prednisone (PDN) as a powerful anti-inflammatory drug that reduces the inflammatory response and promotes tissue repair in multiple inflammation sites. However, the underlying mechanism of PDN in ameliorating myelin damage is not well understood. In our study, a cuprizone (CPZ)-induced demyelinated mouse model was used to explore the mechanism of the protection provided by PDN. Open-field tests showed that CPZ-treated mice exhibited significantly increased anxiety and decreased exploration. However, PDN improved emotional behavior, as evidenced by an increase in the total distance traveled, and central distance traveled as well as the mean amount of time spent in the central area. CPZ-induced demyelination was observed to be alleviated in PDN-treated mice based on luxol fast blue (LFB) staining and myelin basic protein (MBP) expression analyses. In addition, PDN reduced astrocyte and microglia activation in the corpus callosum. Furthermore, we demonstrated that PDN inhibited the Nod-like receptor pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome signaling pathway and related inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, including TNF-α, CCL8, CXCL10 and CXCL16. PDN also reduced the serum corticosterone levels in the CPZ-treated mice. Taken together, these results suggest that inhibition of the NLRP3 signaling pathway may be a novel mechanism by which PDN exerts its protective actions in demyelinating diseases. © 2017</p>"

CC segmentation is a necessary step in both clinical and research studies. CC is commonly studied using structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI); evaluation and segmentation on Diffusion-MRI is important because there is relevant fiber and tissue information presented on these images, although it is challenging and rarely considered. In this work, a pixel-based classifier on Diffusion-MRI (directly in Diffusion-Weighted Imaging) using a Support Vector Machine is proposed for CC segmentation. A subsampling technique, based on K-means clustering, is used to treat the intrinsically unbalanced pixel classification problem. STAPLE algorithm is used to estimate both a silver-standard and a quantitative analysis through sensitivity, specificity and the Dice coefficient metrics.

Considering recent advancements in the field of direct transdifferentiation, conversion of astrocytes as a prominent component of glial scars to the progenitor cells that contribute to the repair mechanisms seems interesting. Recently, we have reported miR-302/367-mediated in vivo conversion of astrocytes into neuroblasts and neurons. In the current study, we used miR-302/367 and valproate (VPA) to show the possibility of conversion of astrocytes to oligodendrocyte progenitor cells and myelinating cells in a cuprizone (CPZ)-induced model of demyelination. Evaluation of behavioural impairment following CPZ and consequent to the treatments showed functional recovery from impairments. Enhanced remyelination was detected by luxol fast blue staining and immunostaining against two mature myelin markers, myelin basic protein and proteolipid protein. Tracing of transduced cells with green fluorescent protein showed their contribution toward generation of new myelinating cells. These findings have suggested that in vivo specific targeting of astrocytes for forced expression of the miR-302/367 cluster and VPA administration may increase the brain's potential for repairing myelin insults by the generation of oligodendroglia from astrocytes. This finding may open a new avenue for enhancement of brain repair in neurodegenerative diseases such as multiple sclerosis. Copyright © 2017 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.

508,2-s2.0-85037977924,Remodeling functional connectivity in multiple sclerosis: A challenging therapeutic approach,"<p>Neurons in the central nervous system are organized in functional units interconnected to form complex networks. Acute and chronic brain damage disrupts brain connectivity producing neurological signs and/or symptoms. In several neurological diseases, particularly in Multiple Sclerosis (MS), structural imaging studies cannot always demonstrate a clear association between lesion site and clinical disability, originating the ""clinico-radiological paradox."" The discrepancy between structural damage and disability can be explained by a complex network perspective. Both brain networks architecture and synaptic plasticity may play important roles in modulating brain networks efficiency after brain damage. In particular, long-term potentiation (LTP) may occur in surviving neurons to compensate network disconnection. In MS, inflammatory cytokines dramatically interfere with synaptic transmission and plasticity. Importantly, in addition to acute and chronic structural damage, inflammation could contribute to reduce brain networks efficiency in MS leading to worse clinical recovery after a relapse and worse disease progression. These evidence suggest that removing inflammation should represent the main therapeutic target in MS; moreover, as synaptic plasticity is particularly altered by inflammation, specific strategies aimed at promoting LTP mechanisms could be effective for enhancing clinical recovery. Modulation of plasticity with different non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) techniques has been used to promote recovery of MS symptoms. Better knowledge of features inducing brain disconnection in MS is crucial to design specific strategies to promote recovery and use NIBS with an increasingly tailored approach. © 2017 Stampanoni Bassi, Gilio, Buttari, Maffei, Marfia, Restivo, Centonze and Iezzi.</p>"
509,2-s2.0-85038238402,Lesion topographies in multiple sclerosis diagnosis: A reappraisal,"<p>Objectives: To assess the contributions of cortico-juxtacortical and corpus callosum lesions to multiple sclerosis diagnosis and to compare the value of ≥1 vs ≥3 periventricular lesions in clinically isolated syndromes (CIS). Methods: Step 1: We evaluated lesion topography classifications in 657 patients with CIS with stepwise Cox proportional hazards regression models considering second attack as the outcome. Step 2: We established 2 dissemination in space (DIS) versions according to the periventricular lesion cutoffs of ≥1 and ≥3 and assessed their performance at 10 years with second attack as the outcome, first individually and then combined with dissemination in time (DIT) in all cases (n 5 326), by age, and by CIS topography. Results: Step 1: The models (hazard ratios [95% confidence interval]) favored ≥1 over ≥3 periventricular lesions (2.5 [1.7-3.6]) and cortico-juxtacortical over juxtacortical lesions (1.4 [1.0-1.8]). Callosal lesions were not selected. Step 2: DIS specificity with ≥1 periventricular lesions was slightly lower than with ≥3 (59.1 vs 61.4) and the same after adding DIT (88.6). Regarding age, ≥3 periventricular lesions improved DIS specificity over ≥ 1 lesions in the 40-49 years of age bracket (66.7 vs 58.3). This difference disappeared when adding DIT (83.3). Optic neuritis had a similar pattern when evaluating CIS topographies. Conclusions: Our results comply with the Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Multiple Sclerosis (MAGNIMS) consensus recommendation of combining cortical and juxtacortical lesions into a single term when possible. Concerning periventricular lesions, maintaining the current $1 cutoff in the McDonald criteria does not compromise specificity in typical CIS cases, but attention should be paid to older patients or optic neuritis cases.

510,2-s2.0-85037662326,Protamine neutralizes chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan-mediated inhibition of oligodendrocyte differentiation,"<p>Chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs), which are enriched in demyelinating plaques in neurodegenerative diseases, such as multiple sclerosis (MS), impair remyelination by inhibiting the migration and differentiation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) in the central nervous system (CNS). We herein show that protamine (PRM, also known as a heparin antagonist) effectively neutralizes the inhibitory activities of CSPGs, thereby enhancing OPC differentiation and (re)myelination in mice. Cell-based assays using mouse OPC-like OL1 cells revealed that the PRM treatment exerted masking effects on extracellular CSPGs and improved oligodendrocyte differentiation on inhibitory CSPG-coated substrates. PRM also bound to the extracellular region of protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type Z (PTPRZ), a membrane-spanning CSPG predominantly expressed in OPCs, and functioned as a ligand mimetic of PTPRZ, thereby suppressing its negative regulatory activity on oligodendrocyte differentiation. In primary cultures, the differentiation of OPCs from wild-type and Ptprz-deficient mice was equally enhanced by PRM. Moreover, the intranasal administration of PRM accelerated myelination in the developing mouse brain, and its intracerebroventricular administration stimulated remyelination after cuprizone-induced demyelination. These results indicate that PRM has CSPG-neutralizing activity which promotes oligodendrocyte differentiation under developmental and morbid conditions. © 2017 Kuboyama et al.

511,2-s2.0-85033503154,Model-based denoising in diffusion-weighted imaging using generalized spherical deconvolution,"<p>Purpose: Diffusion MRI often suffers from low signal-to-noise ratio, especially for high b-values. This work proposes a model-based denoising technique to address this limitation. Methods: A generalization of the multi-shell spherical deconvolution model using a Richardson-Lucy algorithm is applied to noisy data. The reconstructed coefficients are then used in the forward model to compute denoised diffusion-weighted images (DWIs). The proposed method operates in the diffusion space and thus is complementary to image-based denoising methods. Results: We demonstrate improved image quality on the DWIs themselves, maps of neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging, and diffusional kurtosis imaging (DKI), as well as reduced spurious peaks in deterministic tractography. For DKI in particular, we observe up to 50% error reduction and demonstrate high image quality using just 30 DWIs. This corresponds to greater than fourfold reduction in scan time if compared to the widely used 140-DWI acquisitions. We also confirm consistent performance in pathological data sets, namely in white matter lesions of a multiple sclerosis patient. Conclusion: The proposed denoising technique termed generalized spherical deconvolution has the potential of significantly improving image quality in diffusion MRI.

512,2-s2.0-85032864759,Chemotherapy-induced cognitive impairments: White matter pathologies,"<p>Whilst chemotherapeutic agents show promising results in the amelioration of cancerous tumors, patients often experience cognitive disturbances associated with chemotherapy long after treatment has ceased. Research has suggested that the structural integrity of white matter fibres in the brain are susceptible to the harmful effects of chemotherapy. Post-chemotherapy, white matter tracts often display altered morphology with a reduction in glial cells such as oligodendrocytes. Demyelination, gliosis and leukoencephalopathy during or post chemotherapy is associated with changes in processing speed and IQ. Thus, understanding the relationship between chemotherapy, white matter damage and cognition is warranted. This review presents evidence for chemotherapy induced white matter damage highlighting the importance of implementing behavioral and pharmological strategies to prevent or reverse such acute toxicity in the brain. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd</p>"
513,2-s2.0-85030174585,Lineage tracing reveals dynamic changes in oligodendrocyte precursor cells following cuprizone-induced demyelination,"<p>The regeneration of oligodendrocytes is a crucial step in recovery from demyelination, as surviving oligodendrocytes exhibit limited structural plasticity and rarely form additional myelin sheaths. New oligodendrocytes arise through the differentiation of platelet-derived growth factor receptor α (PDGFRα) expressing oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) that are widely distributed throughout the CNS. Although there has been detailed investigation of the behavior of these progenitors in white matter, recent studies suggest that disease burden in multiple sclerosis (MS) is more strongly correlated with gray matter atrophy. The timing and efficiency of remyelination in gray matter is distinct from white matter, but the dynamics of OPCs that contribute to these differences have not been defined. Here, we used in vivo genetic fate tracing to determine the behavior of OPCs in gray and white matter regions in response to cuprizone-induced demyelination. Our studies indicate that the temporal dynamics of OPC differentiation varies significantly between white and gray matter. While OPCs rapidly repopulate the corpus callosum and mature into CC1 expressing mature oligodendrocytes, OPC differentiation in the cingulate cortex and hippocampus occurs much more slowly, resulting in a delay in remyelination relative to the corpus callosum. The protracted maturation of OPCs in gray matter may contribute to greater axonal pathology and disease burden in MS. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p>"
514,2-s2.0-85029582587,Yokukansan Reduces Cuprizone-Induced Demyelination in the Corpus Callosum Through Anti-inflammatory Effects on Microglia,"<p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS). The release of inflammatory cytokines and pro-oxidant molecules from microglia has been shown to play a key role in the pathology of MS. Thus, suppression of microglial cell activation is an attractive therapeutic option. Yokukansan, a traditional Japanese herbal medicine, has been shown to suppress microglial activity in the CNS. However, whether or not yokukansan reduces demyelination observed in the CNS during MS remains unknown. In this study, female C57BL/6 mice were fed a diet containing 0.2% cuprizone (bis-cyclohexanone oxaldihydrazone) to induce demyelination in the corpus callosum. We investigated whether or not yokukansan reduces cuprizone-induced demyelination using immunohistochemical analyses. Furthermore, we examined the in vitro anti-inflammatory effects of yokukansan on LPS-stimulated BV2 cells, a murine microglial cell line. Luxol fast blue staining and immunostaining for myelin basic protein demonstrated that yokukansan reduces demyelination of the corpora callosa of cuprizone-fed mice. In addition, yokukansan significantly decreased the number of activated microglial cells in the corpora callosa of cuprizone-fed mice. Furthermore, treatment with 500 μg/ml yokukansan suppressed the expression of interleukin-1β and inducible nitric-oxide synthase mRNA and protein in LPS-stimulated BV2 cells. These findings suggest that yokukansan reduces demyelination owing to anti-inflammatory effects on microglia. As yokukansan has few adverse effects, yokukansan has the potential to be a novel option to treat MS. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.</p>"
515,2-s2.0-85027975754,Combination of cuprizone and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis to study inflammatory brain lesion formation and progression,"<p>Brain-intrinsic degenerative cascades are a proposed factor driving inflammatory lesion formation in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. We recently described a model combining noninflammatory cytodegeneration (via cuprizone) with the classic active experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (Cup/EAE model), which exhibits inflammatory forebrain lesions. Here, we describe the histopathological characteristics and progression of these Cup/EAE lesions. We show that inflammatory lesions develop at various topographical sites in the forebrain, including white matter tracts and cortical and subcortical grey matter areas. The lesions are characterized by focal demyelination, discontinuation of the perivascular glia limitans, focal axonal damage, and neutrophil granulocyte extravasation. Transgenic mice with enhanced green fluorescent protein-expressing microglia and red fluorescent protein-expressing monocytes reveal that both myeloid cell populations contribute to forebrain inflammatory infiltrates. EAE-triggered inflammatory cerebellar lesions were augmented in mice pre-intoxicated with cuprizone. Gene expression studies suggest roles of the chemokines Cxcl10, Ccl2, and Ccl3 in inflammatory lesion formation. Finally, follow-up experiments in Cup/EAE mice with chronic disease revealed that forebrain, but not spinal cord, lesions undergo spontaneous reorganization and repair. This study underpins the significance of brain-intrinsic degenerative cascades for immune cell recruitment and, in consequence, MS lesion formation. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p>"

The aim of present research was to compare effectiveness of Fluid Attenuation Inversion Recovery (FLAIR) sequence of conventional MRI and Diffuse Weighted Imaging (DWI) sequence as a new technique in detection of brain MS plaques. Materials &amp; Methods In this analytic cross sectional study, sample size was assessed as 40 people to detect any significant difference between two sequences with a level of 0.05. DWI and FLAIR sequences of without contrast brain MRI of consecutive MS patients referred to MRI center of Shahid Sadoughi Hospital, Yazd, Iran from January to May 2012, were evaluated. Results Thirty-two females and 8 males with mean age of 35.20±9.80 yr (range = 11-66 yr) were evaluated and finally 340 plaques including 127 (37.2%) in T2WI, 127 (37.2%) in FLAIR, 63 (18.5%) in DWI and 24 (7.1%) in T1WI were detected. FLAIR sequence was more efficient than DWI in detection of brain MS plaques, oval, round, amorphous plaque shapes, frontal and occipital lobes, periventricular, intracapsular, corpus callosum, centrum semiovale, subcortical, basal ganglia plaques and diameter of detected MS plaques in DWI sequence was smaller than in FLAIR. Conclusion Old lesion can be detected by conventional MRI and new techniques might be more useful in early inflammatory phase of MS and assessment of experimental treatments. © 2017, Iranian Child Neurology Society.

517,2-s2.0-85032740749,Strain differences in cuprizone induced demyelination,"<p>Background: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a severe neurological disorder, characterized by demyelination of the central nervous system (CNS), and with a prevalence of greater than 2 million people worldwide. In terms of research in MS pathology, the cuprizone toxicity model is widely used. Here we investigated the contribution of genetic differences in response to cuprizone-induced demyelination in two genetically different mouse strains: CD1 and C57BL/6. Results: We demonstrate that exposure to a diet containing 0.2% cuprizone resulted in less severe demyelination in the midline of the corpus callosum over the fornix in CD1 mice than C57BL/6 mice. With continuous cuprizone feeding, demyelination in CD1 mice was not prominent until after 7 weeks, in contrast to C57BL/6 mice, which showed prominent demyelination after 4 weeks of exposure. Concomitantly, immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated more oligodendrocytes, as well as fewer oligodendrocyte progenitor cells, microglia and astrocytes in cuprizone treated CD1 mice. We also analyzed 4-weeks-cuprizone treated corpus callosum tissue samples and found that cuprizone treated CD1 mice showed a smaller reduction of myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG) and a smaller increase of Iba1 and NG2. Conclusions: These observations suggest that CD1 mice are less vulnerable to cuprizone-induced demyelination than C57BL/6 mice and thus genetic background factors appear to influence the susceptibility to cuprizone-induced demyelination. © 2017 The Author(s).</p>"

519,2-s2.0-85030762120,Retinal nerve fiber layer thickness and neuropsychiatric manifestations in systemic lupus erythematosus,"<p>Background Cognitive impairment is frequent in systemic lupus erythematosus. Atrophy of the corpus callosum and hippocampus have been reported in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus, and diffusion tensor imaging studies have shown impaired white matter integrity, suggesting that white matter damage in systemic lupus erythematosus may underlie the cognitive impairment as well as other neuropsychiatric systemic lupus erythematosus manifestations. Retinal nerve fiber layer thickness, as assessed by optical coherence tomography, has been suggested as a biomarker for white matter damage in neurologic disorders such as multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. Retinal nerve fiber layer thinning may occur early, even in patients with mild clinical symptoms. Aim The objective of this study was to assess the association of retinal nerve fiber layer thickness, as a biomarker of white matter damage in systemic lupus erythematosus patients, with neuropsychiatric systemic lupus erythematosus manifestations, including cognitive impairment. Methods Twenty-one consecutive patients with systemic lupus erythematosus underwent neuropsychological testing using a validated computerized battery of tests as well as the Rey-Auditory verbal learning test. All 21 patients, as well as 11 healthy, age matched controls, underwent optical coherence tomography testing to assess retinal nerve fiber layer thickness. Correlations between retinal nerve fiber layer thickness and results in eight cognitive domains assessed by the computerized battery of tests as well as the Rey-Auditory verbal learning test were assessed in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus, with and without neuropsychiatric systemic lupus erythematosus, and compared to retinal nerve fiber layer thickness in healthy controls. Results No statistically significant correlation was found between retinal nerve fiber layer thickness in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus as compared to healthy controls. When evaluating by subgroups, no correlation was found between patients with or without neuropsychiatric systemic lupus erythematosus or cognitive impairment and retinal nerve fiber layer thickness. Conclusion Retinal nerve fiber layer thickness of systemic lupus erythematosus patients was not found to be statistically different compared to controls. Within systemic lupus erythematosus patients there was no correlation between retinal nerve fiber layer thickness and cognitive impairment or other neuropsychiatric systemic lupus erythematosus manifestations. © The Author(s), 2017.</p>"

Methods This is a retrospective review of a prospectively followed cohort of MS patients at 2 University specialized MS centers. All patients referred for MS were included. The final diagnosis was recorded and demographic, clinical, laboratory, electrophysiological and radiological variables were collected. Results A total of 554 patients were included in this study of which 431 were referred for diagnostic confirmation. The final diagnosis of MS was confirmed in 300 (70%), while 114 (26%) turned out to have an alternative diagnosis and 15 (3.5%) fulfilled criteria for radiologically isolated syndrome (RIS). The most common alternative diagnoses were psychogenic (16.3%), non-specific MRI white matter lesions (14.7%), NMO (9.5%), migraine (8.6%) and systemic autoimmune disorders (8.6%). The strongest predictors of a final diagnosis of MS were: younger age, presence of oligoclonal bands in the CSF, periventricular, corpus callosum, spinal (P&lt;0.0001), or enhancing lesions (P&lt;0.005) on MRI. Conclusions Our study shows that 30% of patients referred for a suspicion of MS end up with a different diagnosis. The most common alternative diagnoses of MS in the Middle East are not different from what has been described in Western countries. Age, MRI and CSF findings can help with the differential diagnosis. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.</p>"
521,2-s2.0-85031944055,Conditional deletion of the L-type calcium channel Cav1.2 in NG2-positive cells impairs remyelination in mice,"<p>Exploring the molecular mechanisms that drive the maturation of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) during the remyelination process is essential to developing new therapeutic tools to intervene in demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis. To determine whether L-type voltage-gated calcium channels (L-VGCCs) are required for OPC development during remyelination, we generated an inducible conditional knock-out mouse in which the L-VGCC isoform Cav1.2 was deleted in NG2-positive OPCs (Cav1.2<sup>KO</sup>). Using the cuprizone (CPZ) model of demyelination and mice of either sex, we establish that Cav1.2 deletion in OPCs leads to less efficient remyelination of the adult brain. Specifically, Cav1.2<sup>KO</sup> OPCs mature slower and produce less myelin than control oligodendrocytes during the recovery period after CPZ intoxication. This reduced remyelination was accompanied by an important decline in the number of myelinating oligodendrocytes and in the rate of OPC proliferation. Furthermore, during the remyelination phase of the CPZ model, the corpus callosum of Cav1.2<sup>KO</sup> animals presented a significant decrease in the percentage of myelinated axons and a substantial increase in the mean g-ratio of myelinated axons compared with controls. In addition, in a mouse line in which the Cav1.2<sup>KO</sup> OPCs were identified by a Cre reporter, we establish that Cav1.2<sup>KO</sup> OPCs display a reduced maturational rate through the entire remyelination process. These results suggest that Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx mediated by L-VGCCs in oligodendroglial cells is necessary for normal remyelination and is an essential Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel for OPC maturation during the remyelination of the adult brain. © 2017 the authors.</p>"

Differential diagnosis and management of these lesions remain challenging for neurologists. We aim to review the clinico-radiological features of patients with TDLs, as well as their management. Methods We performed a retrospective review of cases of TDLs treated in our center from January 2010 to February 2017. We reviewed the literature. Results Out of 711 patients, we found 15 with TDLs (12 women and 3 men), with a mean age of TDL onset of 36 years. Out of the 15 patients, 9 had TDLs as a first demyelinating event and 44% (4/15) of these converted to MS by McDonald 2010 criteria in a mean time of 8 months (SD 3.10). Clinical presentation was polysymptomatic and the most common radiological findings included solitary lesions (66.66%), located primarily in the frontal (40%) or parietal (33%) lobes, showing mostly an infiltrative morphological pattern (50%) and an open-ring enhancement (43%). Multiple Sclerosis was the most common diagnosis (67%, 10/15). Acute treatment included steroids, plasmapheresis, rituximab and cyclophosphamide. Conclusions Prevalence of tumefactive demyelination in MS was higher than expected in MS patients, according to literature. Time to conversion to MS was significantly shorter than other published series.

It is also a disorder of autoimmune endotheliopathy. SS usually affects young women between the age of 20 and 40 years. SS can be misdiagnosed as multiple sclerosis (MS) or acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) because of similar findings. A 15-year-old girl presented in June 2015 with vomiting and severe headache. Cerebral magnetic resonance imaging revealed multiple lesions in the corpus callosum. Cerebrospinal fluid findings gave normal results. The initial diagnosis was MS and steroid (1000mg/day) was given. She started to describe hallucinations and became paraplegic. She then underwent plasmapheresis five times without response. Her electroencephalogram was diffusely slow with 2-3 Hz delta rhythm at the frontal regions. Audiological examination showed that she had sensorineural hearing loss in her left ear. Ophthalmologic evaluation revealed BRAO in both eyes. On the basis of these findings, she was diagnosed with SS and treated with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and aspirin. After monthly treatment with IVIG for 6 months, the patient has almost fully recovered. SS should be kept in mind in the differential diagnosis of MS and ADEM. © 2017 Medknow Publications.

Baicalein isolated from the roots of Scutellaria baicalensis has been shown to exert anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. The cuprizone model is an established mouse model of MS and causes demyelination and motor dysfunction and induces neuroinflammation, such as glial activation and pro-inflammatory cytokine production. To determine whether Baicalein attenuates cuprizone-induced demyelination, we administrated Baicalein to cuprizone-exposed mice. Baicalein attenuated weight loss (P &lt; 0.05) and motor dysfunction (P &lt; 0.05) in the cuprizone model mice. Baicalein treatment effectively suppressed the demyelination (P &lt; 0.01) and gene expressions of CNP (P &lt; 0.05) and MBP (P &lt; 0.05). Baicalein treatment also inhibited the cuprizone-induced increase in Iba1-positive microglia (P &lt; 0.001), GFAP-positive astrocytes (P &lt; 0.001), and the gene expressions of CD11b (P &lt; 0.01), GFAP (P &lt; 0.05), TNFα (P &lt; 0.05), IL-1β (P &lt; 0.05), and iNOS (p &lt; 0.01).

525,2-s2.0-85027578373,Progesterone therapy induces an M1 to M2 switch in microglia phenotype and suppresses NLRP3 inflammasome in a cuprizone-induced demyelination mouse model,"<p>Demyelination of the central nervous system (CNS) has been associated to reactive microglia in neurodegenerative disorders, such as multiple sclerosis (MS). The M1 microglia phenotype plays a pro-inflammatory role while M2 is involved in anti-inflammatory processes in the brain. In this study, CPZ-induced demyelination mouse model was used to investigate the effect of progesterone (PRO) therapy on microglia activation and neuro-inflammation. Results showed that progesterone therapy (CPZ + PRO) decreased neurological behavioral deficits, as demonstrated by significantly decreased escape latencies, in comparison to CPZ mice. In addition, CPZ + PRO caused a significant reduction in the mRNA expression levels of M1-markers (iNOS, CD86, MHC-II and TNF-α) in the corpus callosum region, whereas the expression of M2-markers (Trem-2, CD206, Arg-1 and TGF-β) was significantly increased, in comparison to CPZ mice. Moreover, CPZ + PRO resulted in a significant decrease in the number of iNOS<sup>+</sup> and Iba-1<sup>+</sup>/iNOS<sup>+</sup> cells (M1), whereas TREM-2<sup>+</sup> and Iba-1<sup>+</sup>/TREM-2<sup>+</sup> cells (M2) significantly increased, in comparison to CPZ group. Furthermore, CPZ + PRO caused a significant decrease in mRNA and protein expression levels of NLRP3 and IL-18 (~ 2-fold), in comparison to the CPZ group. Finally, CPZ + PRO therapy was accompanied with reduced levels of demyelination, compared to CPZ, as confirmed by immunofluorescence to myelin basic protein (MBP) and Luxol Fast Blue (LFB) staining, as well as transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis.

526,2-s2.0-85024110724,Impact of prenatal immune challenge on the demyelination injury during adulthood,"<p>Aim: Brain inflammation is associated with several brain diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS), a disease characterized by demyelination. Whether prenatal immune challenge affects demyelination-induced inflammation in the white matter during adulthood is unclear. In the present study, we used a well-established experimental model of focal demyelination to assess whether prenatal immune challenge affects demyelination-induced inflammation. Methods: Pregnant rats were injected with either lipopolysaccharide (100 μg/kg, ip) or pyrogen-free saline. A 2 μL solution of the gliotoxin ethidium bromide (0.04%) was stereotaxically infused into the corpus callosum of adult male offspring. The extent of demyelination lesion was assessed using Luxol fast blue (LFB) staining. Oligodendrocyte precursor cells, mature oligodendrocytes, markers of cellular gliosis, and inflammation were monitored in the vicinity of the demyelination lesion area. Results: Prenatal lipopolysaccharide reduced the size of the demyelination lesion during adulthood. This reduced lesion was associated with enhanced density of mature oligodendrocytes and reduced density of microglial cells in the vicinity of the demyelination lesion. Such reduction in microglial cell density was accompanied by a reduced activation of the nuclear factor κB signaling pathway. Conclusion: These data strongly suggest that prenatal immune challenge dampens the extent of demyelination during adulthood likely by reprogramming the local brain inflammatory response to demyelinating insults. © 2017 John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd</p>"
527,2-s2.0-85022346582,Mice lacking Gpr37 exhibit decreased expression of the myelin-associated glycoprotein MAG and increased susceptibility to demyelination,"<p>GPR37 is an orphan G protein-coupled receptor that is predominantly expressed in the brain and found at particularly high levels in oligodendrocytes. GPR37 has been shown to exert effects on oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelination during development, but the molecular basis of these actions is incompletely understood and moreover nothing is known about the potential role(s) of this receptor under demyelinating conditions. To shed light on the fundamental biology of GPR37, we performed proteomic studies comparing protein expression levels in the brains of mice lacking GPR37 and its close relative GPR37-like 1 (GPR37L1). These studies revealed that one of the proteins most sharply decreased in the brains of Gpr37/Gpr37L1 double knockout mice is the myelin-associated glycoprotein MAG. Follow-up Western blot studies confirmed this finding and demonstrated that genetic deletion of Gpr37, but not Gpr37L1, results in strikingly decreased brain expression of MAG. Further in vitro studies demonstrated that GPR37 and MAG form a complex when expressed together in cells. As loss of MAG has previously been shown to result in increased susceptibility to brain insults, we additionally assessed Gpr37-knockout (Gpr37<sup>−</sup><sup>/</sup><sup>−</sup>) vs. wild-type mice in the cuprizone model of demyelination. These studies revealed that Gpr37<sup>−</sup><sup>/</sup><sup>−</sup> mice exhibit dramatically increased loss of myelin in response to cuprizone, yet do not show any increased loss of oligodendrocyte precursor cells or mature oligodendrocytes. These findings reveal that loss of GPR37 alters oligodendrocyte physiology and increases susceptibility to demyelination, indicating that GPR37 could be a potential drug target for the treatment of demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis. © 2017 IBRO</p>"
528,2-s2.0-85021716932,A structural MRI study of cholinergic pathways and cognition in multiple sclerosis,"<p>Background White matter hyperintensities (WMH) in the cholinergic pathways are associated with cognitive performance in Alzheimer's disease. This study aimed to evaluate the relationship between the volume reduction of cholinergic pathways and cognitive function in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). Methods Thirty-two MS patients underwent a brain MRI and cognitive measurements including the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Japanese version of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA-J). The extent of WMH within the cholinergic pathways was assessed using the Cholinergic Pathways Hyperintensities Scale (CHIPS). Computerized WMH volumes were also obtained. FreeSurfer was used to measure regional volumes including the cortical and subcortical volumes. The correlations among the CHIPS, the WMH volume, and the clinical data were assessed, in addition to the correlations between the cognitive scores and regional volumes measured by FreeSurfer. Results The CHIPS score and the WMH volume were strongly positively correlated with each other (r = 0.87, P &lt; 0.001). The CHIPS score had significantly negative correlations with the MMSE (r = − 0.49, P = 0.003) and the MoCA-J (r = − 0.47, P = 0.005) results. The WMH volume had significantly negative correlations with the MMSE (r = − 0.54, P = 0.001) and the MoCA-J (r = − 0.57, P &lt; 0.001) results. In the analysis by FreeSurfer, both the MMSE and MoCA-J scores had significant positive correlations only with the volume of the corpus callosum. Conclusions The CHIPS score tended to be less sensitive to the WMH volume in cognitive function evaluation, although the difference did not reach the level of statistical significance. Thus the CHIPS method may not be as effective in MS patients. © 2017</p>"
529,2-s2.0-85021152121,Myelin regulatory factor drives remyelination in multiple sclerosis,"<p>Remyelination is limited in the majority of multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions despite the presence of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) in most lesions. This observation has led to the view that a failure of OPCs to fully differentiate underlies remyelination failure. OPC differentiation requires intricate transcriptional regulation, which may be disrupted in chronic MS lesions. The expression of few transcription factors has been differentially compared between remyelinating lesions and lesions refractory to remyelination. In particular, the oligodendrocyte transcription factor myelin regulatory factor (MYRF) is essential for myelination during development, but its role during remyelination and expression in MS lesions is unknown. To understand the role of MYRF during remyelination, we genetically fate mapped OPCs following lysolecithin-induced demyelination of the corpus callosum in mice and determined that MYRF is expressed in new oligodendrocytes. OPC-specific Myrf deletion did not alter recruitment or proliferation of these cells after demyelination, but decreased the density of new glutathione S-transferase π positive oligodendrocytes. Subsequent remyelination in both the spinal cord and corpus callosum is highly impaired following Myrf deletion from OPCs. Individual OPC-derived oligodendrocytes, produced in response to demyelination, showed little capacity to express myelin proteins following Myrf deletion. Collectively, these data demonstrate a crucial role of MYRF in the transition of oligodendrocytes from a premyelinating to a myelinating phenotype during remyelination. In the human brain, we find that MYRF is expressed in NogoA and CNP-positive oligodendrocytes. In MS, there was both a lower density and proportion of oligodendrocyte lineage cells and NogoA+ oligodendrocytes expressing MYRF in chronically demyelinated lesions compared to remyelinated shadow plaques. The relative scarcity of oligodendrocyte lineage cells expressing MYRF in demyelinated MS lesions demonstrates, for the first time, that chronic lesions lack oligodendrocytes that express this necessary transcription factor for remyelination and supports the notion that a failure to fully differentiate underlies remyelination failure. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.</p>"
530,2-s2.0-85020387862,Corpus callosum atrophy as a marker of clinically meaningful cognitive decline in secondary progressive multiple sclerosis. Impact on employment status,"<p>Cognitive impairment in Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is more frequent and pronounced in secondary progressive MS (SPMS). Cognitive decline is an important predictor of employment status in patients with MS. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) markers have been used to associate tissue damage with cognitive dysfunction. The aim of the study was to designate the MRI marker that predicts cognitive decline in SPMS and explore its effect on employment status. 30 SPMS patients and 30 healthy participants underwent neuropsychological assessment using the Trail Making Test (TMT) parts A and B, semantic and phonological verbal fluency task and a computerized cognitive screening battery (Central Nervous System Vital Signs). Employment status was obtained as a quality of life measure. Brain MRI was performed in all participants. We measured total lesion volume, third ventricle width, thalamic and corpus callosum atrophy. The frequency of cognitive decline for our SPMS patients was 80%. SPMS patients differed significantly from controls in all neuropsychological measures. Corpus callosum area was correlated with cognitive flexibility, processing speed, composite memory, executive functions, psychomotor speed, reaction time and phonological verbal fluency task. Processing speed and composite memory were the most sensitive markers for predicting employment status. Corpus callosum area was the most sensitive MRI marker for memory and processing speed. Corpus callosum atrophy predicts a clinically meaningful cognitive decline, affecting employment status in our SPMS patients. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd</p>"
531,2-s2.0-85020303674,rHIgM22 enhances remyelination in the brain of the cuprizone mouse model of demyelination,"<p>Failure of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) to differentiate and remyelinate axons is thought to be a major cause of the limited ability of the central nervous system to repair plaques of immune-mediated demyelination in multiple sclerosis (MS). Current therapies for MS aim to lessen the immune response in order to reduce the frequency and severity of attacks, but these existing therapies do not target remyelination or stimulate repair of the damaged tissue. Thus, the promotion of OPC differentiation and remyelination is potentially an important therapeutic goal. Previous studies have shown that a recombinant human-derived monoclonal IgM antibody, designated rHIgM22, promotes remyelination, particularly of the spinal cord in rodent models of demyelination. Here, we examined the effects of rHIgM22 in remyelination in the brain using the mouse model of cuprizone-induced demyelination, which is characterized by spontaneous remyelination. The myelination state of the corpus callosum of cuprizone-fed mice treated with rHIgM22 was examined immediately after the end of the cuprizone diet as well as at different time points during the recovery period with regular food, and compared with that of cuprizone-fed animals treated with either vehicle or human IgM isotype control antibody. Mice fed only regular food were used as controls. We demonstrate that treatment with rHIgM22 accelerated remyelination of the demyelinated corpus callosum. The remyelination-enhancing effects of rHIgM22 were found across different, anatomically distinct regions of the corpus callosum, and followed a spatiotemporal pattern that was similar to that of the spontaneous remyelination process. These enhancing effects were also accompanied by increased differentiation of OPCs into mature oligodendrocytes. Our data indicate strong remyelination-promoting capabilities of rHIgM22 and further support its therapeutic potential in MS. © 2017 The Authors</p>"
532,2-s2.0-85029595173,Effects of insulin-like growth factor 1 on pathologic processes in the cuprizone model of multiple sclerosis,"<p>The study aims to evaluate the effect of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) on the demyelination and astrogliosis using the cuprizone murine model. Demyelination was induced in 14 adult male mice by 0.3% cuprizone in drinking water. Five animals from the cuprizone-treated group received subcutaneous injections of IGF-1. Seven animals were used as a control group. The extent of demyelination was evaluated as a decrease in the size of the corpus callosum on T2-weighted images that were received using an 11.7T animal MRI scanner. Brain sections were immunohistochemically stained for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), a marker of astrocytes. It was revealed that the cuprizone caused extensive demyelination and astroglyosis. IGF-1 treatment restored the size of the corpus callosum and the number of astrocytes in the corpus callosum and the anterior commissure to the control level. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.</p>"
533,2-s2.0-85029577497,Oligodendrogenesis and neurogenesis in remyelination in the cuprizone model of multiple sclerosis: Correlation with the degree of lesion,"<p>In this research, a cuprizone model of multiple sclerosis (MS) was used to study oligodendrogenesis and neurogenesis in remyelination. It has been shown that, with the administration of cuprizone, the amount of myelin in a number of structures of white and gray matter and the level of neurogenesis decrease, while the level of oligodendrogenesis increases. The withdrawal of cuprizone leads to the restoration of myelin content, the reduction of the excessive production of oligodendrocytes and to the restoration of the number of neurons to control values. The negative correlation between the number of oligodendrocyte precursors (OPCs) and the degree of demyelination of the corpus callosum indicates migration of OLG precursors from the subventricular zone (SVZ) to the structure during demyelination. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.</p>"
534,2-s2.0-85027712484,Inflammatory demyelination alters subcortical visual circuits,"<p>Background: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory demyelinating disease classically associated with axonal damage and loss; more recently, however, synaptic changes have been recognized as additional contributing factors. An anatomical area commonly affected in MS is the visual pathway; yet, changes other than those associated with inflammatory demyelination of the optic nerve, i.e., optic neuritis, have not been described in detail. Methods: Adult mice were subjected to a diet containing cuprizone to mimic certain aspects of inflammatory demyelination as seen in MS. Demyelination and inflammation were assessed by real-time polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry. Synaptic changes associated with inflammatory demyelination in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) were determined by immunohistochemistry, Western blot analysis, and electrophysiological field potential recordings. Results: In the cuprizone model, demyelination was observed in retinorecipient regions of the subcortical visual system, in particular the dLGN, where it was found accompanied by microglia activation and astrogliosis. In contrast, anterior parts of the pathway, i.e., the optic nerve and tract, appeared largely unaffected. Under the inflammatory demyelinating conditions, as seen in the dLGN of cuprizone-treated mice, there was an overall decrease in excitatory synaptic inputs from retinal ganglion cells. At the same time, the number of synaptic complexes arising from gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-generating inhibitory neurons was found increased, as were the synapses that contain the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) subunit GluN2B and converge onto inhibitory neurons. These synaptic changes were functionally found associated with a shift toward an overall increase in network inhibition. Conclusions: Using the cuprizone model of inflammatory demyelination, our data reveal a novel form of synaptic (mal)adaption in the CNS that is characterized by a shift of the excitation/inhibition balance toward inhibitory network activity associated with an increase in GABAergic inhibitory synapses and a possible increase in excitatory input onto inhibitory interneurons. In addition, our data recognize the cuprizone model as a suitable tool in which to assess the effects of inflammatory demyelination on subcortical retinorecipient regions of the visual system, such as the dLGN, in the absence of overt optic neuritis. © 2017 The Author(s).</p>"
535,2-s2.0-85027396826,Hyperpolarized <sup>13</sup>C MR metabolic imaging can detect neuroinflammation in vivo in a multiple sclerosis murine model,"<p>Proinflammatory mononuclear phagocytes (MPs) play a crucial role in the progression of multiple sclerosis (MS) and other neurodegenerative diseases. Despite advances in neuroimaging, there are currently limited available methods enabling noninvasive detection of MPs in vivo. Interestingly, upon activation and subsequent differentiation toward a proinflammatory phenotype MPs undergo metabolic reprogramming that results in increased glycolysis and production of lactate. Hyperpolarized (HP) <sup>13</sup>C magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) is a clinically translatable imaging method that allows noninvasive monitoring of metabolic pathways in real time. This method has proven highly useful to monitor the Warburg effect in cancer, through MR detection of increased HP [1-<sup>13</sup>C]pyruvate-to-lactate conversion. However, to date, this method has never been applied to the study of neuroinflammation. Here, we questioned the potential of <sup>13</sup>C MRSI of HP [1-<sup>13</sup>C]pyruvate to monitor the presence of neuroinflammatory lesions in vivo in the cuprizone mouse model of MS. First, we demonstrated that <sup>13</sup>C MRSI could detect a significant increase in HP [1-<sup>13</sup>C]pyruvate-to-lactate conversion, which was associated with a high density of proinflammatory MPs. We further demonstrated that the increase in HP [1-<sup>13</sup>C]lactate was likely mediated by pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 up-regulation in activated MPs, resulting in regional pyruvate dehydrogenase inhibition. Altogether, our results demonstrate a potential for <sup>13</sup>C MRSI of HP [1-<sup>13</sup>C]pyruvate as a neuroimaging method for assessment of inflammatory lesions. This approach could prove useful not only in MS but also in other neurological diseases presenting inflammatory components. © 2017, National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.</p>"

In particular, glutamatergic dysregulation in the cortex-basal ganglia-thalamus (CxBGTh) circuit could be associated with decline in these behaviors. Objectives: To investigate the effect of an immunomodulatory therapy (teriflunomide, Aubagio<sup>®</sup>) on changes of the CxBGTh loop in the Theiler’s Murine Encephalomyelitis Virus, (TMEV) mouse model of MS. Methods: Forty-eight (48) mice were infected with TMEV, treated with teriflunomide (24) or control vehicle (24) and followed for 39 weeks. Mice were examined with MRS and volumetric MRI scans (0, 8, 26, and 39 weeks) in the cortex, basal ganglia and thalamus, using a 9.4T scanner, and with behavioral tests (0, 4, 8, 12, 17, 26, and 39 weeks). Within conditions, MRI measures were compared between two time points by paired samples t-test and across multiple time points by repeated measures ANOVA (rmANOVA), and between conditions by independent samples t-test and rmANOVA, respectively. Data were considered as significant at the p&lt;0.01 level and as a trend at p&lt;0.05 level. Results: In the thalamus, the teriflunomide arm exhibited trends toward decreased glutamate levels at 8 and 26 weeks compared to the control arm (p = 0.039 and p = 0.026), while the control arm exhibited a trend toward increased glutamate between 0 to 8 weeks (p = 0.045). In the basal ganglia, the teriflunomide arm exhibited a trend toward decreased glutamate earlier than the control arm, from 0 to 8 weeks (p = 0.011), resulting in decreased glutamate compared to the control arm at 8 weeks (p = 0.016). Conclusions: Teriflunomide may reduce possible excitotoxicity in the thalamus and basal ganglia by lowering glutamate levels. © 2017 Modica et al.

537,2-s2.0-85007158148,Midsagittal corpus callosum area and conversion to multiple sclerosis after clinically isolated syndrome: A multicentre Australian cohort study,"<p>Introduction: Patients presenting with clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) may proceed to clinically definite multiple sclerosis (CDMS). Midsagittal corpus callosum area (CCA) is a surrogate marker for callosal atrophy, and can be obtained from a standard MRI study. This study explores the relationship between CCA measured at CIS presentation (baseline) and at 5 years post presentation, with conversion from CIS to CDMS. The association between CCA and markers of disability progression is explored. Methods: Corpus callosum area was measured on MRI scans at presentation and 5-year review following diagnosis of a first demyelinating event, or evidence of progressive MS, in 143 participants in the Ausimmune/AusLong Study. Relationships between CCA (at baseline and follow-up) and clinical outcomes were assessed. Results: Mean CCA at baseline study was 6.63 cm<sup>2</sup> (SD 1.01). Patients who converted to MS by 5-year review (n = 100) had a significantly smaller mean CCA at follow-up (6.22 vs. 6.74, P = 0.007). Greater CCA reduction was associated with higher annualized relapse rate over follow-up. Conclusion: Baseline CCA obtained from standard MRI protocols may be compared with subsequent MRI examinations as a surrogate for neurodegeneration and cerebral atrophy in patients with MS. This study demonstrates an association between CCA and disability in individuals presenting with CIS who convert to MS. © 2016 The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Radiologists</p>"
538,2-s2.0-84995785009,Cognitive impairment and magnetic resonance imaging correlates in primary progressive multiple sclerosis,"<p>Objectives: To characterize cognitive impairment in primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS) and to correlate the pattern of cognitive deficits with brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) volumetric data. Materials and methods: In a multicenter cross-sectional study, we recruited consecutive patients with PPMS as well as age, sex, and education level-matched healthy controls (HC). All participants underwent neuropsychological (NP) assessment, and brain MRI was performed in patients with PPMS for analysis of lesion load, subcortical GM volumes, and regional cortical volumes. Results: We recruited 55 patients with PPMS and 36 HC. Thirty-six patients were included in the MRI analysis. Patients with PPMS performed significantly worse than HC in all NP tests. Subcortical GM volume was significantly correlated with all NP tests, except for Stroop Test, with the largest effect for the thalamus (r=−.516 [BVMT-R DR, P=.016 FDR-corrected] to r=.664 [SDMT, P&lt;.001 FDR-corrected]). In the stepwise linear regression model, thalamic volume was the only predictor of performance in all NP tests. Conclusion: Cognitive impairment is common in PPMS and affects all evaluated cognitive domains. Subcortical GM volume, particularly of the thalamus, is a strong predictor of cognitive performance, suggesting it has a central role in the pathophysiology of PPMS-related cognitive dysfunction. © 2016 John Wiley &amp; Sons A/S.

539,2-s2.0-85022043192,Disconnection as a mechanism for social cognition impairment in multiple sclerosis,"<p>Objective: To assess the contribution of microstructural normal-appearing white matter (NAWM) damage to social cognition impairment, specifically in the theory of mind (ToM), in multiple sclerosis (MS). Methods: We enrolled consecutively 60 patients with MS and 60 healthy controls (HC) matched on age, sex, and education level. All participants underwent ToM testing (Eyes Test, Videos Test) and 3T brain MRI including conventional and diffusion tensor imaging sequences. Tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) were applied for whole-brain voxel-wise analysis of fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) on NAWM. Results: Patients with MS performed worse on both tasks of ToM compared to HC (Eyes Test 58.7 ± 13.8 vs 81.9 ± 10.4, p &lt; 0.001, Hedges g-1.886; Videos Test 75.3 ± 9.3 vs 88.1 ± 7.1, p &lt; 0.001, Hedges g-1.537). Performance on ToM tests was correlated with higher values of FA and lower values of MD across widespread white matter tracts. The largest effects (≥90% of voxels with statistical significance) for the Eyes Test were body and genu of corpus callosum, fornix, tapetum, uncinate fasciculus, and left inferior cerebellar peduncle, and for the Videos Test genu and splenium of corpus callosum, fornix, uncinate fasciculus, left tapetum, and right superior fronto-occipital fasciculus. Conclusions: These results indicate that a diffuse pattern of NAWM damage in MS contributes to social cognition impairment in the ToM domain, probably due to a mechanism of disconnection within the social brain network. Gray matter pathology is also expected to have an important role; thus further research is required to clarify the neural basis of social cognition impairment in MS. © 2017 American Academy of Neurology.</p>"

542,2-s2.0-85019345901,Diffusion tensor imaging of normal-appearing white matter in patients with neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder and multiple sclerosis,"<p>Background and purpose: The occult changes in normal-appearing white matter (NAWM) were investigated and compared amongst patients with neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD), patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) and healthy controls (HCs) by applying tract-based spatial statistics to diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data. Methods: Diffusion tensor imaging was performed with a 3-T scanner in 93 patients with NMOSD, 53 patients with MS and 43 HCs. Voxel-wise statistical analyses of the DTI data were performed using tract-based spatial statistics. Results: Compared to HCs, patients with NMOSD had significantly lower mean global fractional anisotropy, higher mean diffusivity and radial diffusivity, and no significant differences in axial diffusivity in their NAWM. Patients with MS demonstrated significantly lower mean global fractional anisotropy and higher mean diffusivity, axial diffusivity and radial diffusivity in the NAWM than did patients with NMOSD and HCs. Compared to patients with NMOSD, patients with MS had NAWM damage that was more extensive, particularly in the inferior cerebellar peduncle, external capsule, cingulum, superior fronto-occipital fasciculus and uncinate fasciculus. Conclusions: Using DTI, widespread occult damage was demonstrated in the NAWM of patients with NMOSD. However, the NAWM was less affected in patients with NMOSD than it was in patients with MS; specifically, the axonal injuries and diffusion abnormalities in the association fibers were more severe in patients with MS than they were in patients with NMOSD. © 2017 EAN</p>"
543,2-s2.0-85018860301,Matrine promotes oligodendrocyte development in CNS autoimmunity through the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway,"<p>Aims Matrine (MAT), a quinolizidine alkaloid derived from the herb Radix Sophorae flavescens, has been recently found to be beneficial in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of multiple sclerosis, mainly through its anti-inflammatory effect. In the present study, we tested the effect of MAT on ongoing EAE and defined possible mechanisms underlying its effects on myelination and oligodendrocytes. Main methods EAE was induced in C57BL/6 mice and MAT treatment was started at disease onset. Clinical scores were monitored daily; spinal cords and the corpus callosum brain region of mice were harvested on day 23 p.i. for inflammatory infiltration and demyelination of the central nervous system. Myelin content and the development of oligodendrocytes and their precursors were determined by immunostaining, and expression of p-Akt, p-mTOR, p-PI3K, and p-P70S6 was determined by Western blot. Key findings MAT effectively suppressed EAE severity and increased the expression of proteolipid protein, a myelin protein that is a marker of CNS myelin. MAT treatment largely increased the number of mature oligodendrocytes, and significantly activated the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway, which is required for oligodendrocyte survival and axon myelination. Significance These findings demonstrate a beneficial effect of MAT on oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelination during EAE, most likely through activating the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway. © 2017</p>"

Materials and methods We assessed 29 mildly disabled MS patients and 15 healthy controls using 3T magnetic resonance images (T1-weighted, FLAIR and DTI) and neuropsychological tests assessing different cognitive functions, depression and fatigue. We compared the added value of morphological measures (corpus callosum area corrected for total intracranial volume, index, circularity and the more detailed thickness profile) and diffusion features (fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity) in multilinear models including standard clinical and whole-brain parameters in assessing neuropsychological scores. Results Even in mildly disabled MS patients, a significant reduction of the corpus callosum (p &lt; 0.001) was observed in comparison to healthy controls. Callosal area, index and circularity were significantly (p &lt; 0.002) related to whole-brain white matter volume, T2 lesion load and deep grey matter volume, but not with cortical grey matter. The combination of commonly used imaging and clinical parameters explained between 7% (Fatigue) and 50% (processing speed, verbal memory) of the adjusted variance. Inclusion of the mean diffusivity increased the adjusted R<sup>2</sup> significantly to 69% (p = 0.004) and 71% (p = 0.002) for visuospatial and verbal memory respectively. Conclusion Our results show that callosal features may be used as an alternative to measuring whole-brain volumes. Furthermore, the microstructural integrity of the corpus callosum can help to predict an MS patient's memory performance. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.</p>"
545,2-s2.0-85017249861,The association between retinal nerve fibre layer thickness and corpus callosum index in different clinical subtypes of multiple sclerosis,"<p>The objective of this paper is to evaluate the association between physical disability in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients, the thickness of the retinal nerve fibre layer (RNFL) and corpus callosum volumes, as expressed by the corpus callosum index (CCI). This study was based on a cohort of 212 MS patients and 52 healthy control subjects, who were age and gender matched. The MS patients included 144 women and 177 relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) patients. Peripapillary and volumetric optical coherence tomography (OCT) scans of the macula were performed using spectral-domain OCT technology. All magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were performed using 1.5-T systems. CCI and RNFL were lower in MS than healthy control subjects (0.341 versus 0.386, p &lt; 0.01 and 92.1 versus 105.0, p &lt; 0.01). In addition, CCI correlated with RNFL (r = 0.464, p &lt; 0.01). This was also true for the subgroup of patients with no history of optic neuritis (ON). There is a correlation between the thickness of the RNFL and CCI values in MS patients with no history of ON, which suggests that OCT might be a suitable marker for neurodegeneration in MS clinical trials. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Italia.</p>"
546,2-s2.0-85021239792,Influence of type I IFN signaling on anti-MOG antibody-mediated demyelination,"<p>Background: Antibodies with specificity for myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) are implicated in multiple sclerosis and related diseases. The pathogenic importance of anti-MOG antibody in primary demyelinating pathology remains poorly characterized. Objective: The objective of this study is to investigate whether administration of anti-MOG antibody would be sufficient for demyelination and to determine if type I interferon (IFN) signaling plays a similar role in anti-MOG antibody-mediated pathology, as has been shown for neuromyelitis optica-like pathology. Methods: Purified IgG2a monoclonal anti-MOG antibody and mouse complement were stereotactically injected into the corpus callosum of wild-type and type I IFN receptor deficient mice (IFNAR1-KO) with and without pre-established experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Results: Anti-MOG induced complement-dependent demyelination in the corpus callosum of wild-type mice and did not occur in mice that received control IgG2a. Deposition of activated complement coincided with demyelination, and this was significantly reduced in IFNAR1-KO mice. Co-injection of anti-MOG and complement at onset of symptoms of EAE induced similar levels of callosal demyelination in wild-type and IFNAR1-KO mice. Conclusions: Anti-MOG antibody and complement was sufficient to induce callosal demyelination, and pathology was dependent on type I IFN. Induction of EAE in IFNAR1-KO mice overcame the dependence on type I IFN for anti-MOG and complement-mediated demyelination. © 2017 The Author(s).</p>"
547,2-s2.0-85021234524,Benign multiple sclerosis: Aspects of cognition and neuroimaging,"<p>The existence of a benign multiple sclerosis (BMS) form is a controversial subject. Recent studies of these patients reveal different levels of cognitive impairment, despite the apparent preservation of motor function. The objective of this study was to review and analyze a number of publications that discuss the general aspects of this disease form, such as the definition criteria, prevalence, and clinical and neuroimaging markers. A systematic review of published data on BMS up to October 2015 was performed. Thirty-one published articles were analyzed. The estimated frequency of BMS varied between 6% and 73%. Cognitive impairment was recognized as affecting 17% to 47% of the subjects and presented significant correlation with neuroimaging, such as brain atrophy, increased lesion volume in T2 magnetic resonance assay, and regional grey matter atrophy. The current criteria overestimated the frequency of BMS and, for that reason, this highlights the importance of validating the diagnostic methods practiced. © 2017, Associacao Arquivos de Neuro-Psiquiatria.

The aim of this work was to determine whether and how primary-progressive and relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis subtypes differ regarding conventional MR imaging parameters, cerebral iron deposits, and their association with clinical status. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed 24 patients with primary-progressive MS, 80 with relapsing-remitting MS, and 20 healthy controls with 1.5T MR imaging for assessment of the conventional quantitative parameters: T2 lesion load, T1 lesion load, brain parenchymal fraction, and corpus callosum volume. Quantitative susceptibility mapping was performed to estimate iron concentration in the deep gray matter. RESULTS: Decreased susceptibility within the thalamus in relapsing-remitting MS compared with primary-progressive MS was the only significant MR imaging difference between these MS subtypes. In the relapsing-remitting MS subgroup, the Expanded Disability Status Scale score was positively associated with conventional parameters reflecting white matter lesions and brain atrophy and with iron in the putamen and caudate nucleus. A positive association with putaminal iron and the Expanded Disability Status Scale score was found in primary-progressive MS. CONCLUSIONS: Susceptibility in the thalamus might provide additional support for the differentiation between primary-progressive and relapsing-remitting MS. That the Expanded Disability Status Scale score was associated with conventional MR imaging parameters and iron concentrations in several deep gray matter regions in relapsing-remitting MS, while only a weak association with putaminal iron was observed in primary-progressive MS suggests different driving forces of disability in these MS subtypes. © 2017, American Society of Neuroradiology.

549,2-s2.0-85018385517,Formyl Peptide Receptor 1-Mediated Glial Cell Activation in a Mouse Model of Cuprizone-Induced Demyelination,"<p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic degenerative disease of the central nervous system that is characterized by myelin abnormalities, oligodendrocyte pathology, and concomitant glia activation. Unclear are the factors triggering gliosis and demyelination. New findings suggest an important role of the innate immune response in the initiation and progression of active demyelinating lesions. The innate immune response is induced by pathogen-associated or danger-associated molecular patterns, which are identified by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), including the G-protein coupled with formyl peptide receptors (FPRs). Glial cells, the immune cells of the central nervous system, also express the PRRs. In this study, we used the cuprizone mice model to investigate the expression of the FPR1 in the course of cuprizone-induced demyelination In addition, we used FPR1-deficient mice to analyze glial cell activation through immunohistochemistry and real-time RT-PCR in cuprizone model. Our results revealed a significantly increased expression of FPR1 in the cortex of cuprizone-treated mice. FPR1-deficient mice showed a slight but significant decrease of demyelination in the corpus callosum compared to the wild-type mice. Furthermore, FPR1 deficiency resulted in reduced glial cell activation and mRNA expression of microglia/macrophages markers, as well as pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines in the cortex, compared to wild-type mice after cuprizone-induced demyelination. Combined together, these results suggest that the FPR1 is an important part of the innate immune response in the course of cuprizone-induced demyelination. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.</p>"
550,2-s2.0-85017137382,Corpus callosum involvement: a useful clue for differentiating Fabry Disease from Multiple Sclerosis,"<p>Purpose: Multiple sclerosis (MS) has been proposed as a possible differential diagnosis for Fabry disease (FD). The aim of this work was to evaluate the involvement of corpus callosum (CC) on MR images and its possible role as a radiological sign to differentiate between FD and MS. Methods: In this multicentric study, we retrospectively evaluated the presence of white matter lesions (WMLs) on the FLAIR images of 104 patients with FD and 117 patients with MS. The incidence of CC-WML was assessed in the two groups and also in a subgroup of 37 FD patients showing neurological symptoms. Results: WMLs were detected in 50 of 104 FD patients (48.1%) and in all MS patients. However, a lesion in the CC was detected in only 3 FD patients (2.9%) and in 106 MS patients (90.6%). In the FD subgroup with neurological symptoms, WMLs were present in 26 of 37 patients (70.3%), with two subjects (5.4%) showing a definite callosal lesion. Conclusion: FD patients have a very low incidence of CC involvement on conventional MR images compared to MS, independently from the clinical presentation and the overall degree of WM involvement. Evaluating the presence of CC lesions on brain MR scans can be used as a radiological sign for a differential diagnosis between MS and FD, rapidly addressing the physician toward a correct diagnosis and subsequent treatment options. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.</p>"
551,2-s2.0-85020830750,Correlation between white matter damage and gray matter lesions in multiple sclerosis patients,"<p>We observed the characteristics of white matter fibers and gray matter in multiple sclerosis patients, to identify changes in diffusion tensor imaging fractional anisotropy values following white matter fiber injury. We analyzed the correlation between fractional anisotropy values and changes in whole-brain gray matter volume. The participants included 20 patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis and 20 healthy volunteers as controls. All subjects underwent head magnetic resonance imaging and diffusion tensor imaging. Our results revealed that fractional anisotropy values decreased and gray matter volumes were reduced in the genu and splenium of corpus callosum, left anterior thalamic radiation, hippocampus, uncinate fasciculus, right corticospinal tract, bilateral cingulate gyri, and inferior longitudinal fasciculus in multiple sclerosis patients. Gray matter volumes were significantly different between the two groups in the right frontal lobe (superior frontal, middle frontal, precentral, and orbital gyri), right parietal lobe (postcentral and inferior parietal gyri), right temporal lobe (caudate nucleus), right occipital lobe (middle occipital gyrus), right insula, right parahippocampal gyrus, and left cingulate gyrus. The voxel sizes of atrophic gray matter positively correlated with fractional anisotropy values in white matter association fibers in the patient group. These findings suggest that white matter fiber bundles are extensively injured in multiple sclerosis patients. The main areas of gray matter atrophy in multiple sclerosis are the frontal lobe, parietal lobe, caudate nucleus, parahippocampal gyrus, and cingulate gyrus. Gray matter atrophy is strongly associated with white matter injury in multiple sclerosis patients, particularly with injury to association fibers. © 2017, Medknow Publications.

552,2-s2.0-85010822236,Investigation of Cuprizone Inactivation by Temperature,"<p>Animal models, such as cuprizone (bis-cyclohexanone oxaldihydrazone) feeding, are helpful to study experimental demyelination and remyelination in the context of diseases like multiple sclerosis. Cuprizone is a copper chelator, which when supplemented to the normal food of C57BL/6J mice in a concentration of 0.2% leads to oligodendroglial loss, subsequent microglia and astrocyte activation, resulting in demyelination. Termination of the cuprizone diet results in remyelination, promoted by newly formed mature oligodendrocytes. The exact mode of cuprizone’s action is not well understood, and information about its inactivation and cleavage are still not available. The knowledge of these processes could lead to a better understanding of cuprizone’s mode of action, as well as a safer handling of this toxin. We therefore performed experiments with the aim to inactivate cuprizone by thermal heating, since it was suggested in the past that cuprizone is heat sensitive. C57BL/6J mice were fed for 4 weeks with 0.2% cuprizone, either thermally pretreated (60, 80, 105, 121 °C) or not heated. In addition, primary rat oligodendrocytes, as a known selective toxic target of cuprizone, were incubated with 350 μM cuprizone solutions, which were either thermally pretreated or not. Our results demonstrate that none of the tested thermal pretreatment conditions could abrogate or restrict the toxic and demyelinating effects of cuprizone, neither in vitro nor in vivo. In conclusion, the current study rebuts the hypothesis of cuprizone as a heat-sensitive compound, as well as the assumption that heat exposure is a reason for an insufficient demyelination of cuprizone-containing pellets. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.</p>"
553,2-s2.0-85006262052,Central Atrophy Early in Multiple Sclerosis: Third Ventricle Volumetry versus Planimetry,"<p>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Cerebral atrophy has been suggested to be a reliable magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) predictor of subsequent disability in all stages of multiple sclerosis (MS). However, no accepted methodology for routine clinical use exists to date. We sought an easy to apply and fast technique to evaluate cerebral ventricular volume in patients with MS with similar accuracy as a semiautomatic volumetric method. METHODS: The study included 104 patients, 61 diagnosed with MS and 43 with clinically isolated syndrome. In addition, 30 healthy controls were enrolled. Physical disability was assessed with the expanded disability status scale and cognitive disability with the Multiple Sclerosis Inventory Cognition (MUSIC) test. All subjects received standardized 3-dimensional (3D) MR-imaging on a 3 T scanner. Third ventricle volume (3VV) was obtained from 3D T1-weighted images using a semiautomated technique, and compared against planimetric assessment of the width of the third ventricle aligned (a3VW) and unaligned (u3VW) to anatomical landmarks. RESULTS: a3VW was obtained within seconds with excellent intra- and interrater agreement, and outperformed volumetric measurements regarding the differentiation of MS patients from healthy controls. a3VW had the strongest correlations with 3VV (r =.78, P &lt;.001) and showed moderate inverse correlation with MUSIC cognition score (r = −.310, P &lt;.005). CONCLUSIONS: a3VW is a time-effective and robust biomarker that has strong correlations with volumetric measurements and can be established as standard in the MRI quantification of central brain atrophy in patients with early MS.

554,2-s2.0-85013244023,Machine learning based compartment models with permeability for white matter microstructure imaging,"<p>Some microstructure parameters, such as permeability, remain elusive because mathematical models that express their relationship to the MR signal accurately are intractable. Here, we propose to use computational models learned from simulations to estimate these parameters. We demonstrate the approach in an example which estimates water residence time in brain white matter. The residence time τ<sub>i</sub> of water inside axons is a potentially important biomarker for white matter pathologies of the human central nervous system, as myelin damage is hypothesised to affect axonal permeability, and thus τ<sub>i</sub>. We construct a computational model using Monte Carlo simulations and machine learning (specifically here a random forest regressor) in order to learn a mapping between features derived from diffusion weighted MR signals and ground truth microstructure parameters, including τ<sub>i</sub>. We test our numerical model using simulated and in vivo human brain data. Simulation results show that estimated parameters have strong correlations with the ground truth parameters (R<sup>2</sup>={0.88,0.95,0.82,0.99}) for volume fraction, residence time, axon radius and diffusivity respectively), and provide a marked improvement over the most widely used Kärger model (R<sup>2</sup>={0.75,0.60,0.11,0.99}). The trained model also estimates sensible microstructure parameters from in vivo human brain data acquired from healthy controls, matching values found in literature, and provides better reproducibility than the Kärger model on both the voxel and ROI level. Finally, we acquire data from two Multiple Sclerosis (MS) patients and compare to the values in healthy subjects. We find that in the splenium of corpus callosum (CC-S) the estimate of the residence time is 0.57±0.05 s for the healthy subjects, while in the MS patient with a lesion in CC-S it is 0.33±0.12 s in the normal appearing white matter (NAWM) and 0.19±0.11 s in the lesion. In the corticospinal tracts (CST) the estimate of the residence time is 0.52±0.09 s for the healthy subjects, while in the MS patient with a lesion in CST it is 0.56±0.05 s in the NAWM and 0.13±0.09 s in the lesion. These results agree with our expectations that the residence time in lesions would be lower than in NAWM because the loss of myelin should increase permeability. Overall, we find parameter estimates in the two MS patients consistent with expectations from the pathology of MS lesions demonstrating the clinical potential of this new technique. © 2017 The Authors</p>"
555,2-s2.0-85064692819,Role of MRI in differentiation of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis from multiple sclerosis,"<p>Background: The differentiation between Acute disseminated Encephalomyelitis(ADEM) and Multiple sclerosis(MS) is of utmost importance from clinical prognostic view - point. The different imaging modalities are available; however, MRI plays significant role in prognosis. ADEM is monophasic acute inflammation and demyelination of white matter following recent viral infection or vaccination. Clinical presentation consistent with ADEM can also be the first manifestation of multiple sclerosis (MS), Particularly in children. MS in most patients is a long-lasting chronic disease, characterised by relapses, which may finally transform into a progressive disease. Symptoms unlike MS are more symptomatic rather then focal and include fever and multifocal neurological symptoms. ADEM is considered a disease caused by immune responses of the brain after a severe viral, bacterial or parasitic infection. It can also occur after vaccination MRI can also be helpful in differentiating ADEM from MS. Indistinct lesion borders, gray matter involvement, and diffuse or multilesional enhancement all favor the radiologic diagnosis of ADEM over MS also ADEM have diffuse bilateral lesion Pattern whereas MS have unilateral lesion pattern. ADEM lesions tend to resolve or remain unchanged with no new lesion formation, whereas appearance of new lesion is common in MS. Method: Retrospective analysis of MRI scans of 18 children diagnosed with MS and 10 children with ADEM was performed T-2/FLAIR hyperintense lesions were categorised according to location, description, number and size. T1 W1 before and post gadolinium administration were evaluated for the presence of lesion and post gadolinium enhancement. MRI findings were compared between the groups. Exclusion criteria is patient with orbit tumour and patient with implant. Results: ADEM was seen in children &lt;10 years (M=F) MS &gt;10 years (M&lt;F). History of prior infection was very frequent in ADEM whereas variable in MS. MRI findings to distinguish MS from ADEM are absence of diffuse bilateral lesion pattern, Presence of two or more periventricular lesions. However lesion margin are poorly defined (fuzzy) in ADEM and well defined (Dawson finger) in MS. Post-gadolinium shows patchy/absent enhancement in ADEM and focal enhancement in MS. On followup studies ADEM lesions are resolved whereas MS shows new lesions. Conclusion: MRI is useful in differentiating patient with first attack of MS from those with Monophasic ADEM. © 2017 International Medical Sciences Academy. All rights reserved.</p>"
556,2-s2.0-85018316096,Corpus Callosum Structural Integrity Is Associated with Postural Control Improvement in Persons with Multiple Sclerosis Who Have Minimal Disability,"<p>Background. Improvement of postural control in persons with multiple sclerosis (PwMS) is an important target for neurorehabilitation. Although PwMS are able to improve postural performance with training, the neural underpinnings of these improvements are poorly understood. Objective. To understand the neural underpinnings of postural motor learning in PwMS. Methods. Supraspinal white matter structural connectivity in PwMS was correlated with improvements in postural performance (balancing on an oscillating surface over 25 trials) and retention of improvements (24 hours later). Results. Improvement in postural performance was directly correlated to microstructural integrity of white matter tracts, measured as radial diffusivity, in the corpus callosum, posterior parieto-sensorimotor fibers and the brainstem in PwMS. Within the corpus callosum, the genu and midbody (fibers connecting the prefrontal and primary motor cortices, respectively) were most strongly correlated to improvements in postural control. Twenty-four-hour retention was not correlated to radial diffusivity. Conclusion. PwMS who exhibited poorer white matter tract integrity connecting the cortical hemispheres via the corpus callosum showed the most difficulty learning to control balance on an unstable surface. Prediction of improvements in postural control through training (ie, motor learning) via structural imaging of the brain may allow for identification of individuals who are particularly well suited for postural rehabilitation interventions. © 2016 The Author(s).</p>"
557,2-s2.0-85017568139,Fourier transform power spectrum is a potential measure of tissue alignment in standard MRI: A multiple sclerosis study,"<p>Loss of tissue coherency in brain white matter is found in many neurological diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS). While several approaches have been proposed to evaluate white matter coherency including fractional anisotropy and fiber tracking in diffusion-weighted imaging, few are available for standard magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Here we present an image post-processing method for this purpose based on Fourier transform (FT) power spectrum. T<sub>2</sub>-weighted images were collected from 19 patients (10 relapsing-remitting and 9 secondary progressive MS) and 19 age- and gender-matched controls. Image processing steps included: computation, normalization, and thresholding of FT power spectrum; determination of tissue alignment profile and dominant alignment direction; and calculation of alignment complexity using a new measure named angular entropy. To test the validity of this method, we used a highly organized brain white matter structure, corpus callosum. Six regions of interest were examined from the left, central and right aspects of both genu and splenium. We found that the dominant orientation of each ROI derived from our method was significantly correlated with the predicted directions based on anatomy. There was greater angular entropy in patients than controls, and a trend to be greater in secondary progressive MS patients. These findings suggest that it is possible to detect tissue alignment and anisotropy using traditional MRI, which are routinely acquired in clinical practice. Analysis of FT power spectrum may become a new approach for advancing the evaluation and management of patients with MS and similar disorders. Further confirmation is warranted. © 2017 Sharma, Zhang.

558,2-s2.0-85014902657,"Sudan black: a fast, easy and non-toxic method to assess myelin repair in demyelinating diseases","<p>Aims: The search for novel drugs that enhance myelin repair in entities such as multiple sclerosis has top priority in neurological research, not least because remyelination can hinder further neurodegeneration in neuro-inflammatory conditions. Recently, several new compounds with the potential to boost remyelination have been identified using high-throughput in vitro screening methods. However, assessing their potential to enhance remyelination in vivo using plastic embedded semi-thin sections or electron microscopy, even though being the gold standard for assessing remyelination, is toxic, extremely time-consuming and expensive. Methods: We screened available myelin dyes for a staining candidate which offers a faster and easier alternative to visualize remyelination in cryo-sections. Results: We identified sudan black as a candidate with excellent myelin resolution and we show that our adapted sudan black staining can demonstrate myelin repair in rodent spinal cord cryosections as reliable as in semithin sections, but much faster, easier, less toxic and less expensive. Besides that, it can resolve the small myelinated axons in the corpus callosum. The staining can yet readily be combined with immunostainings which can be challenging in semithin sections. We validated the method in human spinal cord tissue as well as in experimental demyelination of the rat spinal cord by a lysolecithin time course experiment. As proof-of-principle, we demonstrate that sudan black is able to reliably detect the remyelination enhancing properties of benztropine. Conclusion: Our adapted sudan black staining can be used to rapidly and non-toxically screen for remyelinating therapies in demyelinating diseases. © 2016 British Neuropathological Society</p>"
559,2-s2.0-85010792433,The Effect of Stereotactic Injections on Demyelination and Remyelination: a Study in the Cuprizone Model,"<p>Remyelination is the natural repair mechanism in demyelinating disorders of the central nervous system (CNS) such as multiple sclerosis. Several animal models have been used to study demyelination and remyelination. Among toxic animal models, oral administration of the toxin cuprizone leads to white and gray matter demyelination. In contrast, focal demyelination models include the stereotactic application of a toxin such as lysolecithin or ethidium bromide. The injection procedure generates a local disruption of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and might thus trigger a local inflammatory reaction and consequently may influence demyelination and remyelination. In order to study such consequences, we applied stereotactic injections in the cuprizone model where demyelination and remyelination are mediated independent of this procedure. Immunohistochemistry was performed to detect the presence of lymphocytes and activated glial cells in the injection area. Blood protein stainings were used to assess the integrity of the BBB and myelin staining to evaluate demyelination and remyelination processes. Stereotactic injection led to a local disruption of the BBB as shown by local extravasation of blood proteins. Along the injection canal, T and B lymphocytes could be detected and there was a tendency of a higher microgliosis and astrocytosis. However, these changes did not influence demyelination and remyelination processes at the site of injection, in the corpus callosum, or in the cerebral cortex. Our results suggest that a local stereotactic injection has no major impact on CNS demyelination and remyelination. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.</p>"

Small inhibitors were sought with selectivity for the culpable hyper-polarizing K<sup>+</sup> currents. Modeling of interactions with the extracellular pore in a Kv1.1-deduced structure identified diaryldi(2-pyrrolyl)methane as a suitable scaffold with optimized alkyl ammonium side chains. The resultant synthesized candidate [2,2′-((5,5′(di-p-topyldiaryldi(2-pyrrolyl)methane)bis(2,2′carbonyl)bis(azanediyl)) diethaneamine·2HCl] (8) selectively blocked Kv1.1 channels (IC<sub>50</sub> ≈ 15 μM) recombinantly expressed in mammalian cells, induced a positive shift in the voltage dependency of K<sup>+</sup> current activation, and slowed its kinetics. It preferentially inhibited channels containing two or more Kv1.1 subunits regardless of their positioning in concatenated tetramers. In slices of corpus callosum from mice subjected to a demyelination protocol, this novel inhibitor improved neuronal conduction, highlighting its potential for alleviating symptoms in multiple sclerosis. © 2017 American Chemical Society.</p>"
561,2-s2.0-85009231225,An effective method for computerized prediction and segmentation of multiple sclerosis lesions in brain MRI,"<p>Background and objectives Multiple sclerosis is one of the major diseases and the progressive MS lesion formation often leads to cognitive decline and physical disability. A quick and perfect method for estimating the number and size of MS lesions in the brain is very important in estimating the progress of the disease and effectiveness of treatments. But, the accurate identification, characterization and quantification of MS lesions in brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is extremely difficult due to the frequent change in location, size, morphology variation, intensity similarity with normal brain tissues, and inter-subject anatomical variation of brain images. Methods This paper presents a method where adaptive background generation and binarization using global threshold are the key steps for MS lesions detection and segmentation. After performing three phase level set, we add third phase segmented region with contour of brain to connect the normal tissues near the boundary. Then remove all lesions except maximum connected area and corpus callosum of the brain to generate adaptive background. The binarization method is used to select threshold based on entropy and standard deviation preceded by non-gamut image enhancement. The background image is then subtracted from binarized image to find out segmented MS lesions. Results The step of subtraction of background from binarized image does not generate spurious lesions. Binarization steps correctly identify the MS lesions and reduce over or under segmentation. The average Kappa index is 94.88%, Jacard index is 90.43%, correct detection ration is 92.60284%, false detection ratio is 2.55% and relative area error is 5.97% for proposed method. Existing recent methods does not have such accuracy and low value of error rate both mathematically as well as visually due to many spurious lesions generation and over segmentation problems. Conclusions Proposed method accurately identifies the size and number of lesions as well as location of lesions detection as a radiologist performs. The adaptability of the proposed method creates a number of potential opportunities for use in clinical practice for the detection of MS lesions in MRI. Proposed method gives an improved accuracy and low error compare to existing recent methods. © 2017 Elsevier Ireland Ltd</p>"
562,2-s2.0-85008178589,Global and regional annual brain volume loss rates in physiological aging,"<p>The objective is to estimate average global and regional percentage brain volume loss per year (BVL/year) of the physiologically ageing brain. Two independent, cross-sectional single scanner cohorts of healthy subjects were included. The first cohort (n = 248) was acquired at the Medical Prevention Center (MPCH) in Hamburg, Germany. The second cohort (n = 316) was taken from the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS). Brain parenchyma (BP), grey matter (GM), white matter (WM), corpus callosum (CC), and thalamus volumes were calculated. A non-parametric technique was applied to fit the resulting age–volume data. For each age, the BVL/year was derived from the age–volume curves. The resulting BVL/year curves were compared between the two cohorts. For the MPCH cohort, the BVL/year curve of the BP was an increasing function starting from 0.20% at the age of 35 years increasing to 0.52% at 70 years (corresponding values for GM ranged from 0.32 to 0.55%, WM from 0.02 to 0.47%, CC from 0.07 to 0.48%, and thalamus from 0.25 to 0.54%). Mean absolute difference between BVL/year trajectories across the age range of 35–70 years was 0.02% for BP, 0.04% for GM, 0.04% for WM, 0.11% for CC, and 0.02% for the thalamus. Physiological BVL/year rates were remarkably consistent between the two cohorts and independent from the scanner applied. Average BVL/year was clearly age and compartment dependent. These results need to be taken into account when defining cut-off values for pathological annual brain volume loss in disease models, such as multiple sclerosis. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

564,2-s2.0-85013677759,Tissue-type plasminogen activator exerts EGF-like chemokinetic effects on oligodendrocytes in white matter (re)myelination,"<p>Background: The ability of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) to give raise to myelin forming cells during developmental myelination, normal adult physiology and post-lesion remyelination in white matter depends on factors which govern their proliferation, migration and differentiation. Tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) is a serine protease expressed in the central nervous system (CNS), where it regulates cell fate. In particular, tPA has been reported to protect oligodendrocytes from apoptosis and to facilitate the migration of neurons. Here, we investigated whether tPA can also participate in the migration of OPCs during CNS development and during remyelination after focal white matter lesion. Methods: OPC migration was estimated by immunohistological analysis in spinal cord and corpus callosum during development in mice embryos (E13 to P0) and after white matter lesion induced by the stereotactic injection of lysolecithin in adult mice (1 to 21 days post injection). Migration was compared in these conditions between wild type and tPA knock-out animals. The action of tPA was further investigated in an in vitro chemokinesis assay. Results: OPC migration along vessels is delayed in tPA knock-out mice during development and during remyelination. tPA enhances OPC migration via an effect dependent on the activation of epidermal growth factor receptor. Conclusion: Endogenous tPA facilitates the migration of OPCs during development and during remyelination after white matter lesion by the virtue of its epidermal growth factor-like domain. © 2017 The Author(s).</p>"
565,2-s2.0-85029108925,Synaptophysin is a reliable marker for axonal damage,"<p>Synaptophysin is an abundant membrane protein of synaptic vesicles. The objective of this study was to determine the utility of identifying synaptophysin accumulations (spheroids/ovoids/bulbs) in CNS white matter as an immunohistochemical marker of axonal damage in demyelinating and neuroinflammatory conditions. We studied the cuprizone toxicity and Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) infection models of demyelination and analyzed CNS tissue from patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). Synaptophysin colocalized with the amyloid precursor protein (APP), a wellknown marker of axonal damage. In the cuprizone model, numerous pathological synaptophysin/APP-positive spheroids/ovoids were identified in the corpus callosum at the onset of demyelination; the extent of synaptophysin/APP-positive vesicle aggregates correlated with identified reactive microglia; during late and chronic demyelination, the majority of synaptophysin/APP-positive spheroids/ovoids resolved but a few remained, indicating persistent axonal damage in the remyelination phase, scattered large synaptophysin/APPpositive bulbs persisted. In the TMEV model, only a few large- to medium-sized synaptophysin/APP-positive bulbs were found in demyelinated areas. In MS patient tissue samples, the bulbs appeared exclusively at the inflammatory edges of lesions. In conclusion, our data suggest that synaptophysin as a reliable marker of axonal damage in the CNS in inflammatory/demyelinating conditions. © 2017 American Association of Neuropathologists, Inc.</p>"
566,2-s2.0-85012272832,Differentiation of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells from dissociated monolayer &amp; feederfree cultured pluripotent stem cells,"<p>Oligodendrocytes myelinate axons and form myelin sheaths in the central nervous system. The development of therapies for demyelinating diseases, including multiple sclerosis and leukodystrophies, is a challenge because the pathogenic mechanisms of disease remain poorly understood. Primate pluripotent stem cell-derived oligodendrocytes are expected to help elucidate the molecular pathogenesis of these diseases. Oligodendrocytes have been successfully differentiated from human pluripotent stem cells. However, it is challenging to prepare large amounts of oligodendrocytes over a short amount of time because of manipulation difficulties under conventional primate pluripotent stem cell culture methods. We developed a proprietary dissociated monolayer and feeder-free culture system to handle pluripotent stem cell cultures. Because the dissociated monolayer and feeder-free culture system improves the quality and growth of primate pluripotent stem cells, these cells could potentially be differentiated into any desired functional cells and consistently cultured in large-scale conditions. In the current study, oligodendrocyte progenitor cells and mature oligodendrocytes were generated within three months from monkey embryonic stem cells. The embryonic stem cell-derived oligodendrocytes exhibited in vitro myelinogenic potency with rat dorsal root ganglion neurons. Additionally, the transplanted oligodendrocyte progenitor cells differentiated into myelin basic protein-positive mature oligodendrocytes in the mouse corpus callosum. This preparative method was used for human induced pluripotent stem cells, which were also successfully differentiated into oligodendrocyte progenitor cells and mature oligodendrocytes that were capable of myelinating rat dorsal root ganglion neurons. Moreover, it was possible to freeze, thaw, and successfully re-culture the differentiating cells. These results showed that embryonic stem cells and human induced pluripotent stem cells maintained in a dissociated monolayer and feeder-free culture system have the potential to generate oligodendrocyte progenitor cells and mature oligodendrocytes in vitro and in vivo.

567,2-s2.0-85007607625,Developing easy to perform routine MRI measurements as potential surrogates for cognitive impairment in MS,"<p>Objectives One of the most frequently disabling symptoms in Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is cognitive impairment which is often insidious in onset and therefore difficult to recognize in the early stages, for both persons with MS and clinicians. A biomarker that would help identify those at risk of cognitive impairment, or with only mild impairment, would be a useful tool for clinicians. Using MRI, already an integral tool in the diagnosis and monitoring of disease activity in MS, would be ideal. Thus, this study aimed to determine if simple measures on routine MRI could serve as potential biomarkers for cognitive impairment in MS. Patients and methods We retrospectively identified 51 persons with MS who had a cognitive assessment and MRI within six months of the MRI. Simple linear measurements of the hippocampi, bifrontral and third ventricular width, bicaudate width and the anterior, mid and posterior corpus callosum were made. Pearson's correlations examined the relationship between these MRI measures and cognitive tests, and MRI measures were compared in persons with MS who were either normal or cognitively impaired on objective cognitive tests using Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA). Results Bicaudate span and third ventricular width were both negatively correlated, while corpus callosal measures were positive correlated with cognitive test performance. After controlling for potential confounders, bicaudate span was significant different on measures of immediate recall. Both anterior and posterior corpus collosal measure were significantly different on measures of verbal fluency, immediate recall and higher executive function; while the anterior corpus callosum was also significantly different on processing speed. The middle corpus collosal measure was significantly different on immediate recall and higher executive function. Conclusion This study presents data demonstrating that simple to apply MRI measures of atrophy may serve as biomarkers for cognitive impairment in persons with MS. Further prospective studies are needed to validate these findings. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.</p>"
568,2-s2.0-85007394233,"Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis in China, Singapore and Japan: a comparison with the USA","<p>Background and purpose: Ethnicity-related differences in the incidence of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) and other demyelinating diseases including multiple sclerosis and neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders have been reported. Little is reported on the influence of ethnicity and geographical location in ADEM. Methods: Medical records of patients who presented with ADEM (ICD-9 323.61 and 323.81) at large referral hospitals in China, Singapore and Japan (years 1992–2015) were retrospectively reviewed and data were collected in a centralized database. Presenting features and outcomes of ADEM were compared between this multi-country Asian cohort and a uniformly collected US cohort using risk differences and risk ratios. Both cohorts were standardized to a 35% pediatric population to facilitate the comparison. Results: There were 83 Asian patients (48 male, 16 pediatric) followed for a median of 2 (25th–75th percentile 1–10) months. Asian patients exhibited a 26% higher prevalence of spinal cord involvement on magnetic resonance imaging [95% confidence interval (CI) 0–52%; P = 0.05; 63% vs. 37%], a 39% lower prevalence of preceding events (95% CI 12–65%; P &lt; 0.01; 33% vs. 72%) and a 23% lower prevalence of corpus callosum involvement (95% CI 7–39%; P &lt; 0.01; 8% vs. 31%). No difference was observed between the two cohorts in the probability of relapse over the first year after disease onset. Conclusions: It is hypothesized that the high proportion of Asian patients with spinal cord lesions relates to genetic vulnerability or the higher incidence of neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders in Asia or could be a spurious association. ADEM presentations most probably vary across geographical settings or ethnicities. © 2016 EAN</p>"
569,2-s2.0-84996489216,iPS-derived neural progenitor cells from PPMS patients reveal defect in myelin injury response,"<p>Primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS) is a chronic demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS) currently lacking any effective treatment. Promoting endogenous brain repair offers a potential strategy to halt and possibly restore neurologic function in PPMS. To understand how the microenvironment within white matter lesions plays a role in repair we have focused on neural progenitor cells (NPCs) since these are found in lesions in PPMS and have been found to influence oligodendrocyte progenitor cell maturation (OPCs). To better understand the cellular nature of NPCs in PPMS we developed iPS cells from blood samples of PPMS patients and age matched non-disease spouse or blood relative controls. Using these iPS cell lines we determined that the NPCs from PPMS cases provided no neuroprotection against active CNS demyelination compared to NPCs from control iPS lines which were capable of completely preventing injury. Conditioned media (CM) from PPMS NPCs provides no protection to OPCs and prevents maturation of OPCs into oligodendrocytes in vitro. We also found that CM from PPMS iPS NPCs elicited patient-specific differences in the response to compounds that should foster oligodendrocyte (OL) maturation. Together, these data establish a new model for understanding the nature of myelination defects in PPMS which may lead to novel targeted approaches for preventing demyelination in these patients. © 2016</p>"
570,2-s2.0-85010904568,"Astrocyte-derived tissue Transglutaminase affects fibronectin deposition, but not aggregation, during cuprizone-induced demyelination","<p>Astrogliosis as seen in Multiple Sclerosis (MS) develops into astroglial scarring, which is beneficial because it seals off the site of central nervous system (CNS) damage. However, astroglial scarring also forms an obstacle that inhibits axon outgrowth and (re)myelination in brain lesions. This is possibly an important cause for incomplete remyelination in the CNS of early stage MS patients and for failure in remyelination when the disease progresses. In this study we address whether under demyelinating conditions in vivo, tissue Transglutaminase (TG2), a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent enzyme that catalyses posttranslational modification of proteins, contributes to extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition and/or aggregation. We used the cuprizone model for de-and remyelination. TG2 immunoreactivity and enzymatic activity time-dependently appeared in astrocytes and ECM, respectively, in the corpus callosum of cuprizone-treated mice. Enhanced presence of soluble monomeric and multimeric fibronectin was detected during demyelination, and fibronectin immunoreactivity was slightly decreased in cuprizone-treated TG2<sup>-/-</sup> mice. In vitro TG2 overexpression in astrocytes coincided with more, while knock-down of TG2 with less fibronectin production. TG2 contributes, at least partly, to fibronectin production, and may play a role in fibronectin deposition during cuprizone-induced demyelination. Our observations are of interest in understanding the functional implications of TG2 during astrogliosis. © 2017 The Author(s).</p>"
571,2-s2.0-85037591924,Electroacupuncture Promotes Remyelination after Cuprizone Treatment by Enhancing Myelin Debris Clearance,"<p>Promoting remyelination is crucial for patients with demyelinating diseases including multiple sclerosis. However, it is still a circuitous conundrum finding a practical remyelinating therapy. Electroacupuncture (EA), originating from traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), has been widely used to treat CNS diseases all over the world, but the role of EA in demyelinating diseases is barely known. In this study, we examined the remyelinating properties and mechanisms of EA in cuprizone-induced demyelinating model, a CNS demyelinating murine model of multiple sclerosis. By feeding C57BL/6 mice with chow containing 0.2% cuprizone for 5 weeks, we successfully induce demyelination as proved by weight change, beam test, pole test, histomorphology, and Western Blot. EA treatment significantly improves the neurobehavioral performance at week 7 (2 weeks after withdrawing cuprizone chow). RNA-seq and RT-PCR results reveal up-regulated expression of myelin-related genes, and the expression of myelin associated protein (MBP, CNPase, and O4) are also increased after EA treatment, indicating therapeutic effect of EA on cuprizone model. It is widely acknowledged that microglia exert phagocytic effect on degraded myelin debris and clear these detrimental debris, which is a necessary process for subsequent remyelination. We found the remyelinating effect of EA is associated with enhanced clearance of degraded myelin debris as detected by dMBP staining and red oil O staining. Our further studies suggest that more microglia assemble in demyelinating area (corpus callosum) during the process of EA treatment, and cells inside corpus callosum are mostly in a plump, ameboid, and phagocytic shape, quite different from the ramified cells outside corpus callosum. RNA-seq result also unravels that most genes relating to positive regulation of phagocytosis (GO:0050766) are up-regulated, indicating enhanced phagocytic process after EA treatment. During the process of myelin debris clearance, microglia tend to change their phenotype toward M2 phenotype. Thus, we also probed into the phenotype of microglia in our study. Immuno-staining results show increased expression of CD206 and Arg1, and the ratio of CD206/CD16/32 are also higher in EA group. In conclusion, these results demonstrate for the first time that EA enhances myelin debris removal from activated microglia after demyelination, and promotes remyelination. © Copyright © 2017 Zhu, Sun, Kang, Zou, Wu and Wang.</p>"
572,2-s2.0-85069298968,Assessment of multiple areas on magnetic resonance midsagittal brain images in multiple sclerosis patients,"<p>The aim of the study was to compare the first and last magnetic resonance images (MRIs) in patients diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (MS) with MRIs of normal subjects. We wanted to investigate the region initially involved in MS patients. In this retrospective study, midsagittal plane was explored on brain MRIs taken at the time when MS diagnosis was established and the last MRI was obtained following treatment for MS. Comparison was done between healthy subjects and patients diagnosed with MS. The measures included the area of corpus callosum, cerebrum, cerebellum, pons, bulbus, fourth ventricle and pituitary gland. As a result, while there was growth in the fourth ventricle area, there was shrinkage in the other areas in MS patients. In women, the tissues involved at the beginning of the disease were pituitary gland, cerebrum and bulbus, and in men corpus callosum and cerebrum. Atrophy was not time-dependent. Assessment of the correlation between the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDDS) and atrophy revealed an increase in EDDS (disease progression) to be associated with a decrease in the area of cerebrum and corpus callosum in men, and an increase in the fourth ventricular area in women. In conclusion, we demonstrated that pituitary gland atrophy develops in the early stage of MS, especially in women. Additional studies are needed to investigate the phenomenon of early pituitary and bulbus atrophy in women versus late atrophy of these tissues in men. © 2017, Academy of Medical Sciences of Croatica.

573,2-s2.0-85038399053,Fingolimod protects against ischemic white matter damage by modulating microglia toward M2 polarization via STAT3 pathway,"<p>Background and Purpose-White matter (WM) ischemic injury, a major neuropathological feature of cerebral small vessel diseases, is an important cause of vascular cognitive impairment in later life. The pathogenesis of demyelination after WM ischemic damage are often accompanied by microglial activation. Fingolimod (FTY720) was approved for the treatment of multiple sclerosis for its immunosuppression property. In this study, we evaluated the neuroprotective potential of FTY720 in a WM ischemia model. Methods-Chronic WM ischemic injury model was induced by bilateral carotid artery stenosis. Cognitive function, WM integrity, microglial activation, and potential pathway involved in microglial polarization were assessed after bilateral carotid artery stenosis. Results-Disruption of WM integrity was characterized by demyelination in the corpus callosum and disorganization of Ranvier nodes using Luxol fast blue staining, immunofluorescence staining, and electron microscopy. In addition, radial maze test demonstrated that working memory performance was decreased at 1-month post-bilateral carotid artery stenosis-induced injury. Interestingly, FTY720 could reduce cognitive decline and ameliorate the disruption of WM integrity. Mechanistically, cerebral hypoperfusion induced microglial activation, production of associated proinflammatory cytokines, and priming of microglial polarization toward the M1 phenotype, whereas FTY720 attenuated microgliamediated neuroinflammation after WM ischemia and promoted oligodendrocytogenesis by shifting microglia toward M2 polarization. FTY720's effect on microglial M2 polarization was largely suppressed by selective signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) blockade in vitro, revealing that FTY720-enabled shift of microglia from M1 to M2 polarization state was possibly mediated by STAT3 signaling. Conclusions-Our study suggested that FTY720 might be a potential therapeutic drug targeting brain inflammation by skewing microglia toward M2 polarization after chronic cerebral hypoperfusion.

A 34-year-old woman developed Graves' disease 11 months following an initial course of alemtuzumab treatment for MS. Nine months following the second treatment with alemtuzumab, the patient presented with spontaneous intramuscular and subcutaneous haemorrhage due to development of an inhibitory autoantibody to coagulation factor VIII. Acquired haemophilia A (AHA) is an extremely rare complication in patients treated with alemtuzumab. Treatment with rituximab may induce a rapid remission of AHA; however, the patient's high John Cunningham virus (JCV) antibody index and alemtuzumab-induced T cell lymphopenia may lead to an increased risk of progressive multifocal leucoencephalopathy, a potential complication which was unacceptable to the patient. © 2017 BMJ Publishing Group Ltd (unless otherwise stated in the text of the article).

However, the efficacy of EA has not been examined in neuropathologic conditions. Objective: In vivo neuroprotective effects of EA on cuprizone (cup)-induced demyelination were evaluated. Material and methods: C57BL/6 J mice were fed with chow containing 0.2% cup for 4 weeks to induce oligodendrocytes (OLGs) depletion predominantly in the corpus callosum (CC). EA was administered at different doses (40 or 80 mg/kg body weight/day/i.p.) from the first day of cup diet. Oligodendrocytes apoptosis [TUNEL assay and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG<sup>+</sup>)/caspase-3<sup>+</sup> cells), gliosis (H&amp;E staining, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP<sup>+</sup>) and macrophage-3 (Mac-3<sup>+</sup>) cells) and inflammatory markers (interleukin 17 (IL-17), interleukin 11 (IL-11) and stromal cell-derived factor 1 α (SDF-1α) or CXCL12] during cup intoxication were examined. Results: High dose of EA (EA-80) increased mature oligodendrocytes population (MOG<sup>+</sup> cells, p&lt;0.001), and decreased apoptosis (p&lt;0.05) compared with the cup mice. Treatment with both EA doses did not show any considerable effects on the expression of CXCL12, but significantly down-regulated the expression of IL-17 and up-regulated the expression of IL-11 in mRNA levels compared with the cup mice. Only treatment with EA-80 significantly decreased the population of active macrophage (MAC-3<sup>+</sup> cells, p&lt;0.001) but not reactive astrocytes (GFAP<sup>+</sup> cells) compared with the cup mice. Discussion and conclusion: In this model, EA-80 effectively reduces lesions via reduction of neuroinflammation and toxic effects of cup on mature OLGs.

A recent quantitative clinically-targeted MRI method, fast macromolecular proton fraction (MPF) mapping demonstrated a promise as a myelin biomarker in human and animal studies with a particular advantage of sensitivity to both white matter (WM) and gray matter (GM) demyelination. This study aimed to histologically validate the capability of MPF mapping to quantify myelin loss in brain tissues using the cuprizone demyelination model. Whole-brain MPF maps were obtained in vivo on an 11.7T animal MRI scanner from 7 cuprizone-treated and 7 control ?57BL/6 mice using the fast single-point synthetic-reference method. Brain sections were histologically stained with Luxol Fast Blue (LFB) for myelin quantification. Significant (p &lt; 0.05) demyelination in cuprizone-treated animals was found according to both LFB staining and MPF in all anatomical structures (corpus callosum, anterior commissure, internal capsule, thalamus, caudoputamen, and cortex). MPF strongly correlated with quantitative histology in all animals (r = 0.95, p &lt; 0.001) as well as in treatment and control groups taken separately (r = 0.96, p = 0.002 and r = 0.93, p = 0.007, respectively). Close agreement between histological myelin staining and MPF suggests that fast MPF mapping enables robust and accurate quantitative assessment of demyelination in both WM and GM. © The Author(s) 2017.</p>"

The aim of the present work is to investigate the protective effects of erythropoietin against cuprizone-induced oxidative stress. Materials and Methods: Adult male C57BL/6J mice were fed a chow containing 0.2 % cuprizone for 6 weeks. After 3 weeks, mice were simultaneously treated with erythropoietin (5,000 IU/kg body weight) by daily intraperitoneal injections. Results: Our results showed that cuprizone induced oxidative stress accompanied with down-regulation of subunits of the respiratory chain complex and demyelination of corpus callosum. Erythropoietin antagonized these effects. Biochemical analysis showed that oxidative stress induced by cuprizone was regulated by erythropoietin. Similarly, erythropoietin induced the expression of subunits of the respiratory chain complex over normal control values reflecting a mechanism to compensate cuprizone-mediated down-regulation of these genes. Conclusion: The data implicate that erythropoietin abolishes destructive cuprizone effects in the corpus callosum by decreasing oxidative stress and restoring mitochondrial respiratory enzyme activity. © 2017, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences.

580,2-s2.0-85021447782,Longitudinal MR spectroscopy of neurodegeneration in multiple sclerosis with diffusion of the intra-axonal constituent N-acetylaspartate,"<p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a pathologically complex CNS disease: inflammation, demyelination, and neuroaxonal degeneration occur concurrently and may depend on one another. Current therapies are aimed at the immune-mediated, inflammatory destruction of myelin, whereas axonal degeneration is ongoing and not specifically targeted. Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance spectroscopy can measure the diffusivity of metabolites in vivo, such as the axonal/neuronal constituent N-acetylaspartate, allowing compartment-specific assessment of disease-related changes. Previously, we found significantly lower N-acetylaspartate diffusivity in people with MS compared to healthy controls (Wood et al., 2012) suggesting that this technique can measure axonal degeneration and could be useful in developing neuroprotective agents. In this longitudinal study, we found that N-acetylaspartate diffusivity decreased by 8.3% (p &lt; 0.05) over 6 months in participants who were experiencing clinical or MRI evidence of inflammatory activity (n = 13), whereas there was no significant change in N-acetylaspartate diffusivity in the context of clinical and radiological stability (n = 6). As N-acetylaspartate diffusivity measurements are thought to more specifically reflect the intra-axonal space, these data suggest that N-acetylaspartate diffusivity can report on axonal health on the background of multiple pathological processes in MS, both cross-sectionally and longitudinally. © 2017</p>"

We applied a novel echo modulation curve (EMC) algorithm to identify T<sub>2</sub> changes in normal-appearing brain regions of subjects with RRMS (N = 27) compared to age-matched controls (N = 38). Methods The EMC algorithm uses Bloch simulations to model T<sub>2</sub> decay curves in multi-spin-echo MRI sequences, independent of scanner, and scan-settings. T<sub>2</sub> values were extracted from normal-appearing white and gray matter brain regions using both expert manual regions-of-interest and user-independent FreeSurfer segmentation. Results Compared to conventional exponential T<sub>2</sub> modeling, EMC fitting provided more accurate estimations of T<sub>2</sub> with less variance across scans, MRI systems, and healthy individuals. Thalamic T<sub>2</sub> was increased 8.5% in RRMS subjects (p &lt; 0.001) and could be used to discriminate RRMS from healthy controls well (AUC = 0.913). Manual segmentation detected both statistically significant increases (corpus callosum &amp; temporal stem) and decreases (posterior limb internal capsule) in T<sub>2</sub> associated with RRMS diagnosis (all p &lt; 0.05). In healthy controls, we also observed statistically significant T<sub>2</sub> differences for different white and gray matter structures. Conclusions The EMC algorithm precisely characterizes T<sub>2</sub> values, and is able to detect subtle T<sub>2</sub> changes in normal-appearing brain regions of RRMS patients. These presumably capture both axon and myelin changes from inflammation and neurodegeneration. Further, T<sub>2</sub> variations between different brain regions of healthy controls may correlate with distinct nervous tissue environments that differ from one another at a mesoscopic length-scale. © 2017 The Authors</p>"
584,2-s2.0-85011411604,Combining clinical and magnetic resonance imaging markers enhances prediction of 12-year disability in multiple sclerosis,"<p>Background: Disease progression and treatment efficacy vary among individuals with multiple sclerosis. Reliable predictors of individual disease outcomes are lacking. Objective: To examine the accuracy of the early prediction of 12-year disability outcomes using clinical and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) parameters. Methods: A total of 177 patients from the original Avonex-Steroids-Azathioprine study were included. Participants underwent 3-month clinical follow-ups. Cox models were used to model the associations between clinical and MRI markers at baseline or after 12 months with sustained disability progression (SDP) over the 12-year observation period. Results: At baseline, T2 lesion number, T1 and T2 lesion volumes, corpus callosum (CC), and thalamic fraction were the best predictors of SDP (hazard ratio (HR) = 1.7-4.6; p ≤ 0.001-0.012). At 12 months, Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) and its change, number of new or enlarging T2 lesions, and CC volume % change were the best predictors of SDP over the follow-up (HR = 1.7-3.5; p ≤ 0.001-0.017). A composite score was generated from a subset of the best predictors of SDP. Scores of ≥4 had greater specificity (90%-100%) and were associated with greater cumulative risk of SDP (HR = 3.2-21.6; p &lt; 0.001) compared to the individual predictors. Conclusion: The combination of established MRI and clinical indices with MRI volumetric predictors improves the prediction of SDP over long-term follow-up and may provide valuable information for therapeutic decisions. © The Author(s), 2016.</p>"
585,2-s2.0-85010338480,miR-219 attenuates demyelination in cuprizone-induced demyelinated mice by regulating monocarboxylate transporter 1,"<p>Remyelination is limited in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) due to the difficulties in recruiting proliferating oligodendrocyte precursors (OPCs), the inhibition of OPC differentiation and/or maturation, and/or failure in the generation of the myelin sheath. In vitro studies have revealed that miR-219 is necessary for OPC differentiation and monocarboxylate transporter 1 (MCT1) plays a vital role in oligodendrocyte maturation and myelin synthesis. Herein, we hypothesized that miR-219 might promote oligodendrocyte differentiation and attenuate demyelination in a cuprizone (CPZ)-induced demyelinated model by regulating the expression of MCT1. We found that CPZ-treated mice exhibited significantly increased anxiety in the open field test. However, miR-219 reduced anxiety as shown by an increase in the total distance, the central distance and the mean amount of time spent in the central area. miR-219 decreased the quantity of OPCs and increased the number of oligodendrocytes and the level of myelin basic protein (MBP) and cyclic nucleotide 3′ phosphodiesterase (CNP) protein. Ultrastructural studies further confirmed that the extent of demyelination was attenuated by miR-219 overexpression. Meanwhile, miR-219 also greatly enhanced MCT1 expression via suppression of oligodendrocyte differentiation inhibitors, Sox6 and Hes5, treatment with the MCT1 inhibitor α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamate (4-CIN) reduced the number of oligodendrocytes and the protein levels of MBP and CNP. Taken together, these results suggest a novel mode of action of miR-219 via MCT1 in vivo and may provide a new potential remyelination therapeutic target. © 2016 Federation of European Neuroscience Societies and John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd</p>"

Neuropsychological assessment and MRI were obtained from 39 relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) patients and 29 healthy controls (HCs). Patients were classified as CI or CP according to cognitive ability, and demographic characteristics and MRI images were compared. Compared with HCs, MS patients exhibited widespread damage in WM integrity, and GM loss in several regions. Compared with CP patients, CI patients exhibited more extensive WM impairments, particularly in the corpus callosum, cerebellar peduncle, corona radiata, optic radiation, superior longitudinal fasciculus, anterior limb of the internal capsule, and cingulate, as well as decreased GM volume in the bilateral caudate, left insula and right temporal lobe. MS patients with CI exhibited more significant structural abnormalities than those with CP. Widespread impairments of WM integrity and selective GM atrophy both appear to be associated with impaired cognition in RRMS. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.</p>"
588,2-s2.0-85000956541,Significant Role(s) of CXCL12 and the SDF-1 3′A genetic variant in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis,"<p>Both cellular and molecular components of the immune system are among the substantial factors involved in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis (MS). Accumulating evidence confirms that chemokines, as the main members of the immune system, play key roles in the regulation of immune responses. Immune system genetic parameters are believed to influence the onset of immune system-related diseases. Regarding the significant role of the CXCR4/CXCL12 axis in cell differentiation and survival and homing of hematopoietic progenitors to the bone marrow and regulation of neuronal progenitor cell migration in the central nervous system (CNS), genetic factors can cause an increased expression of CXCL12 and induce a vigorous immune response against CNS antigens in MS patients. Previous studies have indicated that the expression of CXCL12 could be affected by its polymorphisms at position +801 at the region of the CXCL12 3′A genetic variation. Finally, CXCL12 seems to be involved in the cellular part of the events that take place in the CNS, and therefore it could be considered as a target in MS therapies. Thus, this review was aimed to describe the recent progress in understanding the role of CXCL12 in MS, with an emphasis on CXCL12 serum concentrations and its gene polymorphism at position +801. © 2016 S.

589,2-s2.0-84994753728,Neurocognitive impairment is associated with corpus callosum atrophy in multiple sclerosis,"<p>The objective of this study was to evaluate the association between annualized corpus callosum (aCC) atrophy and cognitive impairment in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. This is a cohort study of clinically isolated syndrome suggestive of multiple sclerosis (CIS) and relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) patients based on an analysis of serial MRI examinations. The validated Multiple Sclerosis Inventory Cognition (MUSIC) was used to assess cognitive dysfunction. 39% of patients (n = 17, mean score 15.5 ± 2.9) had cognitive dysfunction and 61% (n = 27, mean score 23.6 ± 2.5) had no signs of cognitive impairment. Overall mean annualized corpus callosum index (aCCI) change was −0.72% ± 0.96%. Patients with cognitive dysfunction presented higher aCCI reduction: 0.95% ± 0.78% in comparison with patients without signs of cognitive impairment: 0.57% ± 1.06% (p = 0.044). Multivariate analysis revealed that aCC atrophy (β = 227.1; p = 0.05) was an independent predictor of cognitive impairment (adjusted R<sup>2</sup> = 0.355; F = 1.777; p = 0.02). Progression of aCC atrophy is associated with the development of cognitive dysfunction in MS patients. © 2016 Elsevier GmbH</p>"
590,2-s2.0-84982225566,Astrocyte-targeted production of interleukin-6 reduces astroglial and microglial activation in the cuprizone demyelination model: Implications for myelin clearance and oligodendrocyte maturation,"<p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic demyelinating disease of the central nervous system. Interleukin (IL)−6 is a pleiotropic cytokine with a potential role in MS. Here we used transgenic mice with astrocyte-targeted production of IL-6 (GFAP-IL6Tg) to study the effect of IL-6 in the cuprizone-induced demyelination paradigm, which is an experimental model of de- and re-myelination, both hallmarks of MS. Our results demonstrated that cuprizone-treated GFAP-IL6Tg mice showed a significant reduction in astroglial and especially microglial activation/accumulation in the corpus callosum in comparison with the corresponding cuprizone-treated wild type (WT). Production of a key microglial attracting chemokine CXCL10, as well as CXCL1 and CCL4 was lower in cuprizone-treated GFAP-IL6Tg mice compared with cuprizone-treated WT. Reduced microglial cell accumulation was associated with inefficient removal of degraded myelin and axonal protection in cuprizone-treated GFAP-IL6Tg mice, compared with WT mice at the peak of demyelination. In addition, transgenic production of IL-6 did not alter initial oligodendrocyte (OL) apoptosis and oligodendrocyte precursor cell recruitment to the lesion site, but it impaired early OL differentiation, possibly due to impaired removal of degraded myelin. Indeed, a microglial receptor involved in myelin phagocytosis, TREM2, as well as the phagolysosomal protein CD68 were lower in cuprizone-treated GFAP-IL6Tg compared with WT mice. Our results show for the first time that astrocyte-targeted production of IL-6 may play a role in modulating experimental demyelination induced by cuprizone. Further understanding of the IL-6-mediated molecular mechanisms involved in the regulation of demyelination is needed, and may have implications for the development of future therapeutic strategies for the treatment of MS.
