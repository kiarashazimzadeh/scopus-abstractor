Due to the heterogeneous information that can be extracted from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) it can be difficult to fuse such data in a proper way. One interesting case is given by the analysis of diffusion imaging (DI) data. DI techniques give an important variety of information about the status of microstructure in the brain. This is interesting information to use especially in longitudinal setting where the temporal evolution of the pathology is an important added value. In this paper, we propose a new tensor-based framework capable to detect longitudinal changes appearing in DI data in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. We focus our attention to the analysis of longitudinal changes occurring along different white matter (WM) fiber-bundles. Our main goal is to detect which subset of fibers (within a bundle) and which sections of these fibers contain 'pathological' longitudinal changes. The framework consists of three main parts: i) preprocessing of longitudinal diffusion acquisitions and WM fiber-bundles extraction, ii) data tensorization and rank selection, iii) application of a parallelized constrained tensor factorization algorithm to detect longitudinal 'pathological' changes. The proposed method was applied on simulated longitudinal variations and on real MS data. High level of accuracy and precision were obtained in the detection of small longitudinal changes along the WM fiber-bundles. © 2013 IEEE.</p>"
262,2-s2.0-85096192745,The potential therapeutic effect of adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cell transplantation on cuprizone model of multiple sclerosis in the mice,"<p>Background: Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune neurodegenerative disease. Current treatments have limited effect on the upstream pathophysiology of the disease. Nowadays, mesenchymal stem cells are considered to be a potential therapeutic tool for various neurodegenerative diseases. Their immune privileged status, trophic nature, and capacity to differentiate into various lineages makes them an ideal vehicle for treatment options. Aim of the Study: the goal of this study was to assess the remyelinating potential of adipose mesenchymal stem cells (ADMSCs) in cuprizone model of MS. Material and Methods: AD-MSCs were obtained from male mice and characterized by flow cytometry. Thirty-six female C57BL/6 mice were divided equally among three groups. Group I (control group): mice were fed with a normal diet through the entire duration of the experiment. Groups II and III: mice were fed with a 0.2 % cuprizone containing diet for six weeks. By the end of the sixth week, group II and III mice received a single intravenous injection of 500 μl of a complete culture medium and 1 × 106 AD-MSCs suspended in 500 μl of a complete culture medium respectively. Neurological tests were done before and 9-10 days after the injection. All mice were euthanized at day 10 and corpus callosum was processed for further histological and biochemical examination. Morphometric study was done to assess remyelination. Migration of the male AD-MSCs into the female mice brain was confirmed by SRY gene expression. The obtained data were further statistically analyzed. Results: Cuprizone intake for 6 weeks caused extensive demyelination similar to MS accompanied by neurological deficits and change in the oxidative stress. Intravenous administration of AD-MSCs in group III enhanced the remyelination process improved the motor and cognitive functions and decrease the oxidant level. Conclusion: AD-MSCs provide a valuable potential treatment for neurodegenerative demyelinating diseases such as MS. © 2020 Egyptian Society of Histology and Cytology. All rights reserved.</p>"
263,2-s2.0-85085690734,Concurrence of multiple sclerosis and primary biliary cholangitis: Report of 3 cases,"<p>Background: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disorder of the central nervous system which damages the myelin and axon. Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is a slow progressive liver disease with autoimmune feature in which non-purulent destructive cholangitis and interlobular bile duct destruction occur. Involvement of each of PBC and MS is thought to be related to environmental exposure in genetically susceptible persons. Case Presentation: Here, we aim to report 3 women 52, 27 and 51 years old with MS and PBC. Conclusion: Although MS seems to have an association with some autoimmune gastrointestinal disorders such as ulcerative colitis, the concurrence of MS and PBC has been rarely reported. © 2020 Caspian Journal of Internal Medicine.

264,2-s2.0-85082096720,SWAN-venule: An optimized MRI technique to detect the central vein sign in MS Plaques,"<p>Background and Purpose: Multiple sclerosis lesions develop around small veins that are radiologically described as the socalled central vein sign. With 7T MR imaging and magnetic susceptibility-based sequences, the central vein sign has been observed in 80%-100% of MS lesions in patients' brains. However, a lower proportion ∼50% has been reported at 3T using susceptibilityweighted angiography (SWAN). Our aim was to assess a modified version of SWAN optimized at 3T for sensitive detection of the central vein sign. Materials and Methods: Thirty subjects with MS were scanned on a 3T clinical MR imaging system. 3D T2-weighted FLAIR and optimized 3D SWAN called SWAN-venule, were acquired after injection of a gadolinium-based contrast agent. Patients showing &gt;3 focal white matter lesions were included. The central vein sign was recorded by 2 trained raters on SWAN-venule images in the supratentorial brain. Results: Twenty patients showing &gt;3 white matter lesions were included. A total of 380 white matter lesions (135 periventricular, 144 deep white matter, and 101 juxtacortical) seen on both FLAIR and SWAN-venule images were analyzed. Overall, the central vein sign was detected in 86% of the white matter lesions (periventricular, 89%; deep white matter, 95%; and juxtacortical, 78%). Conclusions: The SWAN-venule technique is an optimized MR imaging sequence for highly sensitive detection of the central vein sign in MS brain lesions. This work will facilitate the validation and integration of the central vein sign to increase the diagnostic certainty of MS and further prevent misdiagnosis in clinical practice. © 2020 American Society of Neuroradiology.

265,2-s2.0-85079445853,Position Sense Deficits at the Lower Limbs in Early Multiple Sclerosis: Clinical and Neural Correlates,"<p>Background/Objective. Position sense, defined as the ability to identify joint and limb position in space, is crucial for balance and gait but has received limited attention in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). We investigated lower limb position sense deficits, their neural correlates, and their effects on standing balance in patients with early MS. Methods. A total of 24 patients with early relapsing-remitting MS and 24 healthy controls performed ipsilateral and contralateral matching tasks with the right foot during functional magnetic resonance imaging. Corpus callosum (CC) integrity was estimated with diffusion tensor imaging. Patients also underwent an assessment of balance during quiet standing. We investigated differences between the 2 groups and the relations among proprioceptive errors, balance performance, and functional/structural correlates. Results. During the contralateral matching task, patients demonstrated a higher matching error than controls, which correlated with the microstructural damage of the CC and with balance ability. In contrast, during the ipsilateral task, the 2 groups showed a similar matching performance, but patients displayed a functional reorganization involving the parietal areas. Neural activity in the frontoparietal regions correlated with the performance during both proprioceptive matching tasks and quiet standing. Conclusion. Patients with early MS had subtle, clinically undetectable, position sense deficits at the lower limbs that, nevertheless, affected standing balance. Functional changes allowed correct proprioception processing during the ipsilateral matching task but not during the more demanding bilateral task, possibly because of damage to the CC. These findings provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying disability in MS and could influence the design of neurorehabilitation protocols. © The Author(s) 2020.</p>"
266,2-s2.0-85078048694,Factors Affecting the Diagnostic Yield of Frame-Based Stereotactic Intracranial Biopsies,"<p>Objective: Frame-based stereotactic biopsy (FSB) remains the “gold standard” for obtaining diagnostic samples of intracranial lesions to guide therapy. Nevertheless, diagnostic yield is highly variable. This study aims to provide an analysis of diagnostic yield, surgical complications, and factors associated with obtaining nondiagnostic samples in a contemporary FSB series. Methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted of all adult patients with imaging-documented lesions undergoing FSB at our institution between 2013 and 2018. Diagnostic accuracy, lesion characteristics associated with nondiagnostic biopsy, and surgical complications were evaluated. A biopsy was considered nondiagnostic if all frozen samples and the final pathology yielded normal brain tissue or nonspecific reactive tissue unless the “reactive” pathology was consistent with radiation injury from prior therapy. Results: Our search identified 198 FSB patients. Mean (standard deviation) age was 62 ± 17 years, and 44.2% were female. Median procedure time was 32 minutes. A definitive histologic diagnosis was established in 187 cases (94.4% diagnostic yield). Mean lesion diameter was 31.9 ± 16.8 mm. Multivariable logistic regression revealed only lesion diameter to be significantly associated with diagnostic result (odds ratio for nondiagnostic result: 0.94 per mm diameter decrease, 95% confidence interval 0.87–0.99, P = 0.028). On univariable analysis, diagnosis of central nervous system lymphoma appeared to increase the risk of a nondiagnostic biopsy (P = 0.025), but this association disappeared when controlling for lesion size and steroid administration before biopsy. Eight patients (4.0%) developed postoperative hemorrhagic complications, 3 of whom required reoperation, and another expired. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that diagnostic yield from contemporary FSB is high and depends predominantly on lesion size. © 2019</p>"
267,2-s2.0-85077922865,Towards microstructure-informed material models for human brain tissue,"<p>Emerging evidence suggests that the mechanical behavior of the brain plays a critical role in development, disease, and aging. Recent studies have begun to characterize the mechanical behavior of gray and white matter tissue and to identify sets of material models that best reproduce the stress-strain behavior of different brain regions. Yet, these models are mainly phenomenological in nature, their parameters often lack clear physical interpretation, and they fail to correlate the mechanical behavior to the underlying microstructural composition. Here we make a first attempt towards identifying general relations between microstructure and mechanics with the ultimate goal to develop microstructurally motivated constitutive equations for human brain tissue. Using histological staining, we analyze the microstructure of brain specimens from different anatomical regions, the cortex, basal ganglia, corona radiata, and corpus callosum, and identify the regional stiffness and viscosity under multiple loading conditions, simple shear, compression, and tension. Strikingly, our study reveals a negative correlation between cell count and stiffness, a positive correlation between myelin content and stiffness, and a negative correlation between proteoglycan content and stiffness. Additionally, our analysis shows a positive correlation between lipid and proteoglycan content and viscosity. We demonstrate how understanding the microstructural origin of the macroscopic behavior of the brain can help us design microstructure-informed material models for human brain tissue that inherently capture regional heterogeneities. This study represents an important step towards using brain tissue stiffness and viscosity as early diagnostic markers for clinical conditions including chronic traumatic encephalopathy, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, or multiple sclerosis. Statement of significance: The complex and heterogeneous mechanical properties of brain tissue play a critical role for brain function. To understand and predict how brain tissue properties vary in space and time, it will be key to link the mechanical behavior to the underlying microstructural composition. Here we use histological staining to quantify area fractions of microstructural components of mechanically tested specimens and evaluate their individual contributions to the nonlinear macroscopic mechanical response. We further propose a microstructure-informed material model for human brain tissue that inherently captures regional heterogeneities. The current work provides unprecedented insights into the biomechanics of human brain tissue, which are highly relevant to develop refined computational models for brain tissue behavior or to advance neural tissue engineering. © 2019</p>"

METHODS: Using standard MRI, the primary pathologies in MS of axonal injury/loss, demyelination, and inflammation are not differentiated well. DBSI has been shown in animal models, phantoms, and in biopsied and autopsied human CNS tissues to distinguish these pathologies. Fifty-five pwMS (22 relapsing-remitting, 17 primary progressive, and 16 secondary progressive) and 13 healthy subjects underwent DBSI analyses of NAWM of the CC, the main WM tract connecting the cerebral hemispheres. Tract-based spatial statistics were used to minimize misalignment. Results were correlated with scores from a battery of clinical tests focused on deficits typical of MS. RESULTS: Normal-appearing CC in pwMS showed reduced fiber fraction and increased nonrestricted isotropic fraction, with the most extensive abnormalities in secondary progressive MS (SPMS). Reduced DBSI-derived fiber fraction and increased DBSI-derived nonrestricted isotropic fraction of the CC correlated with worse cognitive scores in pwMS. Increased nonrestricted isotropic fraction in the body of the CC correlated with impaired hand function in the SPMS cohort. CONCLUSIONS: DBSI fiber fraction and nonrestricted isotropic fraction were the most useful markers of injury in the NAWM CC. These 2 DBSI measures reflect axon loss in animal models. Because of its ability to reveal axonal loss, as well as demyelination, DBSI may be a useful outcome measure for trials of CNS reparative treatments. Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

270,2-s2.0-85076707931,"High fat diet consumption results in mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and oligodendrocyte loss in the central nervous system","<p>Metabolic syndrome is a key risk factor and co-morbidity in multiple sclerosis (MS) and other neurological conditions, such that a better understanding of how a high fat diet contributes to oligodendrocyte loss and the capacity for myelin regeneration has the potential to highlight new treatment targets. Results demonstrate that modeling metabolic dysfunction in mice with chronic high fat diet (HFD) consumption promotes loss of oligodendrocyte progenitors across the brain and spinal cord. A number of transcriptomic and metabolomic changes in ER stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and oxidative stress pathways in HFD-fed mouse spinal cords were also identified. Moreover, deficits in TCA cycle intermediates and mitochondrial respiration were observed in the chronic HFD spinal cord tissue. Oligodendrocytes are known to be particularly vulnerable to oxidative damage, and we observed increased markers of oxidative stress in both the brain and spinal cord of HFD-fed mice. We additionally identified that increased apoptotic cell death signaling is underway in oligodendrocytes from mice chronically fed a HFD. When cultured under high saturated fat conditions, oligodendrocytes decreased both mitochondrial function and differentiation. Overall, our findings show that HFD-related changes in metabolic regulators, decreased mitochondrial function, and oxidative stress contribute to a loss of myelinating cells. These studies identify HFD consumption as a key modifiable lifestyle factor for improved myelin integrity in the adult central nervous system and in addition new tractable metabolic targets for myelin protection and repair strategies. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.</p>"
271,2-s2.0-85075975039,Longitudinal evaluation of demyelinated lesions in a multiple sclerosis model using ultrashort echo time magnetization transfer (UTE-MT) imaging,"<p>Alterations in myelin integrity are involved in many neurological disorders and demyelinating diseases, such as multiple sclerosis (MS). Although magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the gold standard method to diagnose and monitor MS patients, clinically available MRI protocols show limited specificity for myelin detection, notably in cerebral grey matter areas. Ultrashort echo time (UTE) MRI has shown great promise for direct imaging of lipids and myelin sheaths, and thus holds potential to improve lesion detection. In this study, we used a sequence combining magnetization transfer (MT) with UTE (“UTE-MT”, TE ​= ​76 ​μs) and with short TE (“STE-MT”, TE ​= ​3000 ​μs) to evaluate spatial and temporal changes in brain myelin content in the cuprizone mouse model for MS on a clinical 7 ​T scanner. During demyelination, UTE-MT ratio (UTE-MTR) and STE-MT ratio (STE-MTR) values were significantly decreased in most white matter and grey matter regions. However, only UTE-MTR detected cortical changes. After remyelination in subcortical and cortical areas, UTE-MTR values remained lower than baseline values, indicating that UTE-MT, but not STE-MT, imaging detected long-lasting changes following a demyelinating event. Next, we evaluated the potential correlations between imaging values and underlying histopathological markers. The strongest correlation was observed between UTE-MTR and percent coverage of myelin basic protein (MBP) immunostaining (r<sup>2</sup> ​= ​0.71). A significant, although lower, correlation was observed between STE-MTR and MBP (r<sup>2</sup> ​= ​0.48), and no correlation was found between UTE-MTR or STE-MTR and gliosis immunostaining. Interestingly, correlations varied across brain substructures. Altogether, our results demonstrate that UTE-MTR values significantly correlate with myelin content as measured by histopathology, not only in white matter, but also in subcortical and cortical grey matter regions in the cuprizone mouse model for MS. Readily implemented on a clinical 7 ​T system, this approach thus holds great potential for detecting demyelinating/remyelinating events in both white and grey matter areas in humans. When applied to patients with neurological disorders, including MS patient populations, UTE-MT methods may improve the non-invasive longitudinal monitoring of brain lesions, not only during disease progression but also in response to next generation remyelinating therapies. © 2019</p>"
272,2-s2.0-85075803713,Is the walk ratio a window to the cerebellum in multiple sclerosis? A structural magnetic resonance imaging study,"<p>Background and purpose: Existing research studies have demonstrated a relationship between magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) neuroimaging measures and walking speed in people with multiple sclerosis (PwMS). However, to date there are no data as to the brain structures involved in gait coordination and control in PwMS. Therefore, the aim of our study was to investigate the association between walk ratio, an indicator of gait coordination, and related brain structures in PwMS. Methods: A brain MRI was performed by a 3.0-T MR scanner in conjunction with a volumetric analysis based on three-dimensional T1-weighted images. Regions of interest were volumes of the hippocampus, amygdala, putamen, caudate, pallidum, thalamus, cerebellum and the corpus callosum regions. Walking speed and walk ratio, defined as step length divided by step rate, was measured whilst walking on an electronic walkway. Results: In all, 343 PwMS (41.1 ± 13.4 years, 69.1% female, median Expanded Disability Status Scale 2.5) were included in the study. A significant association was found between the left cerebellum volume and walk ratio after controlling for age, gender, total cranial volume and disability; R<sup>2</sup> = 0.379, P = 0.002. A similar association was found between the right cerebellum volume and walk ratio, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.364, P = 0.002. No correlations were observed between walk ratio and the thalamus, basal ganglia, hippocampus, amygdala and the corpus callosum volumes. No association was found between walking speed and all brain measures. Conclusions: The walk ratio should be considered when evaluating and assessing PwMS presenting with ataxia. Furthermore, it is also hypothesized that a low walk ratio indicates a lower cerebellum volume in the MS population. © 2019 European Academy of Neurology</p>"
273,2-s2.0-85075474310,Myelin Damage in Normal Appearing White Matter Contributes to Impaired Cognitive Processing Speed in Multiple Sclerosis,"<p>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Cognitive impairment is a core symptom in multiple sclerosis (MS). Damage to normal appearing white matter (NAWM) is likely involved. We sought to determine if greater myelin heterogeneity in NAWM is associated with decreased cognitive performance in MS. METHODS: A total of 27 participants with MS and 13 controls matched for age, sex, and education underwent myelin water imaging (MWI) from which the myelin water fraction (MWF) was calculated. Corpus callosum, superior longitudinal fasciculus, and cingulum were chosen as regions of interest (ROIs) a priori based on their involvement in MS-related cognitive impairment. Cognitive performance was assessed using the Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT). Pearson ́s product moment correlations were performed to assess relationships between cognitive performance and myelin heterogeneity (variance of MWF within an ROI). RESULTS: In MS, myelin heterogeneity in all three ROIs was significantly associated with performance on the SDMT. These correlations ranged from moderate (r = −.561) to moderately strong (r = −.654) and were highly significant (P values ranged from.001 to.0002). Conversely, myelin heterogeneity was not associated with SDMT performance in controls in any ROI (P &gt;.108). CONCLUSION: Increased myelin heterogeneity in NAWM is associated with decreased cognitive processing speed performance in MS. © 2019 by the American Society of Neuroimaging</p>"
274,2-s2.0-85075375287,MRI-Based Manual versus Automated Corpus Callosum Volumetric Measurements in Multiple Sclerosis,"<p>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Corpus callosum atrophy is a neurodegenerative biomarker in multiple sclerosis (MS). Manual delineations are gold standard but subjective and labor intensive. Novel automated methods are promising but require validation. We aimed to compare the robustness of manual versus automatic corpus callosum segmentations based on FreeSurfer. METHODS: Nine MS patients (6 females, age 38 ± 13 years, disease duration 7.3 ± 5.2 years) were scanned twice with repositioning using 3-dimensional T<sub>1</sub>-weighted magnetic resonance imaging on three scanners (two 1.5 T and one 3.0 T), that is, six scans/patient, on the same day. Normalized corpus callosum areas were measured independently by a junior doctor and neuroradiologist. The cross-sectional and longitudinal streams of FreeSurfer were used to segment the corpus callosum volume. RESULTS: Manual measurements had high intrarater (junior doctor.96 and neuroradiologist.96) and interrater agreement (.94), by intraclass correlation coefficient (P &lt;.001). The coefficient of variation was lowest for longitudinal FreeSurfer (.96% within scanners; 2.0% between scanners) compared to cross-sectional FreeSurfer (3.7%, P =.001; 3.8%, P =.058) and the neuroradiologist (2.3%, P =.005; 2.4%, P =.33). Longitudinal FreeSurfer was also more accurate than cross-sectional (Dice scores 83.9 ± 7.5% vs. 78.9 ± 8.4%, P &lt;.01 relative to manual segmentations). The corpus callosum measures correlated with physical disability (longitudinal FreeSurfer r = –.36, P &lt;.01; neuroradiologist r = –.32, P &lt;.01) and cognitive disability (longitudinal FreeSurfer r =.68, P &lt;.001; neuroradiologist r =.64, P &lt;.001). CONCLUSIONS: FreeSurfer's longitudinal stream provides corpus callosum measures with better repeatability than current manual methods and with similar clinical correlations. However, due to some limitations in accuracy, caution is warranted when using FreeSurfer with clinical data. © 2019 by the American Society of Neuroimaging</p>"

276,2-s2.0-85074812037,Biopsy histopathology in the diagnosis of adult-onset leukoencephalopathy with axonal spheroids and pigmented glia (ALSP),"<p>Aim: Adult-onset leukoencephalopathy with axonal spheroids and pigmented glia (ALSP) is an inherited rare disease affecting young adults. We present the clinical, imaging, and neuropathological results of our case series, emphasizing biopsy histology combined with clinical information will increase the accuracy of early diagnosis. Methods: In total, 4 females and 2 male ALSP patients with onset at ages 24–45 years were enrolled. Clinical manifestations, neuroimaging, and histopathology as well as gene mutation were analyzed and compared with literature. Results: Clinical manifestations include cognitive decline with/without psycho-behavior problems and movement disorders including paralysis, hemiplegia, parkinsonism, and pyramidal tract injury, as well as dysarthria, dysphagia, and sensory disturbances. MRI showed multiple periventricular and subcortical white matter lesions, involving the corpus callosum, with no enhancement, but with persistent hyperintensity on diffuse-weighted imaging. Histology showed widespread white matter damage and pale stain, especially destroyed axons with spheroids and funicular axons which were stained with neurofilament and ubiquitin. Foamy and pigmented macrophages were another typical change. CSF1R mutation was found in 4 of them. All of the patients were misdiagnosed and treated for a long time for multiple sclerosis, cerebral infarction, normal pressure hydrocephalus, etc. Conclusion: ALSP will cause rapidly progressing dementia with/without movement disorders in young adults. The definite diagnosis should be based on a comprehensive analysis of clinical manifestations, and neuroimaging, histology, and genetic results. Early biopsy will add to the accuracy of the diagnosis. © 2019, Fondazione Società Italiana di Neurologia.</p>"
277,2-s2.0-85074414743,Patterns of regional brain volume loss in multiple sclerosis: a cluster analysis,"<p>Objectives: Although whole and individual regional brain volume loss have been separately reported to correlate with disability in multiple sclerosis (MS), hierarchical cluster analyses of the whole and regional brain to find their pattern in MS are few. Methods: We cross-sectionally conducted high-resolution, T1-weighted volumetric MRI examinations in 75 MS patients and 21 healthy controls (HCs) to measure the volumes of whole brain and a total of 56 brain regions of interest. Using a hierarchical cluster analysis with multivariate imaging data, we classified the patients into clusters according to their brain-volume patterns. Principal component analysis was also applied. Clinical features and brain volumes were then compared among the MS clusters. Results: The MS patients were categorized into three major clusters (Clusters 1, 2, and 3) with increasing disability in that order. Principal component analysis also identified Clusters 1, 2 and 3. Whole brain volume and supratentorial regional brain volumes, including thalamus and corpus callosum, decreased severely in Cluster 3 and moderately in Cluster 2, while equally preserved in Cluster 1 and the HCs. Only the volumes of the ventral diencephalon and T1 white matter hypointensities significantly differed in Clusters 1, 2 and 3 and HCs. In contrast, the volumes of the cerebellar cortex and brainstem were significantly different between Clusters 3 and 1, whereas there were no significant differences between Clusters 1 and 2 and Clusters 2 and 3. Conclusion: We identified brain regions that exhibit different degree of atrophy in a background of global brain atrophy in MS. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.</p>"
278,2-s2.0-85073944674,The active contribution of OPCs to neuroinflammation is mediated by LRP1,"<p>Oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) account for about 5% of total brain and spinal cord cells, giving rise to myelinating oligodendrocytes that provide electrical insulation to neurons of the CNS. OPCs have also recently been shown to regulate inflammatory responses and glial scar formation, suggesting functions that extend beyond myelination. Low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) is a multifaceted phagocytic receptor that is highly expressed in several CNS cell types, including OPCs. Here, we have generated an oligodendroglia-specific knockout of LRP1, which presents with normal myelin development, but is associated with better outcomes in two animal models of demyelination (EAE and cuprizone). At a mechanistic level, LRP1 did not directly affect OPC differentiation into mature oligodendrocytes. Instead, animals lacking LRP1 in OPCs in the demyelinating CNS were characterized by a robust dampening of inflammation. In particular, LRP1-deficient OPCs presented with impaired antigen cross-presentation machinery, suggesting a failure to propagate the inflammatory response and thus promoting faster myelin repair and neuroprotection. Our study places OPCs as major regulators of neuroinflammation in an LRP1-dependent fashion. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.</p>"

Understanding its anatomo-functional substrates is relevant to provide more specific therapeutic interventions. Objectives: To investigate the association between hand motor performance and anatomo-functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) abnormalities in pwMS. Methods: A total of 134 healthy controls (HC) and 366 pwMS underwent the Nine-Hole-Peg-Test (9HPT), structural and resting state (RS) functional MRI. Multivariate analyses identified the independent predictors of hand motor performance. Results: PwMS versus HC showed widespread gray matter atrophy, microstructural white matter abnormalities, and decreased RS functional connectivity in motor and cognitive networks. Predictors of worse right-9HPT (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.52) were decreased right superior cerebellar peduncle and right lemniscus fractional anisotropy (FA) (p ⩽ 0.02), left angular gyrus atrophy (p &lt; 0.003), decreased RS connectivity in left superior frontal gyrus, and left posterior cerebellum (p &lt; 0.001). Worse left 9HPT (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.56) was predicted by decreased right corticospinal FA (p = 0.003), atrophy of left anterior cingulum and left cerebellum (p ⩽ 0.02), decreased RS connectivity of left lingual gyrus and right posterior cerebellum in cerebellar and executive networks (p ⩽ 0.02). Conclusion: Structural and functional abnormalities of regions involved in motor functions contribute to explain motor disability in pwMS.

280,2-s2.0-85075839608,Evolutionary genomics analysis of human nucleus-encoded mitochondrial genes: implications for the roles of energy production and metabolic pathways in the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of demyelinating diseases,"<p>The myelin sheath is a plasma membrane extension that lines nerve fibers to protect, support and insulate neurons. The myelination of axons in vertebrates enables fast, saltatory impulse propagation, and this process relies on organelles, especially on mitochondria to supply energy. Approximately 99% of mitochondrial proteins are encoded in the nucleus. Since mitochondria play a central role in the energy production and metabolic pathways, which are essential for myelinogenesis, studying these nucleus-encoded genes (nMGs) may provide new insights into the roles of energy metabolism in demyelinating diseases. In this work, a multiomics-based approach was employed to 1) construct a 1,740 human nMG subset with mitochondrial localization evidence obtained from the Integrated Mitochondrial Protein Index (IMPI) and MitoCarta databases, 2) conduct an evolutionary genomics analysis across mouse, rat, monkey, chimp, and human models, 3) examine dysmyelination phenotype-related genes (nMG subset genes with oligodendrocyte- ​and myelin-related ​phenotypes, OMP-nMGs) in MGI mouse lines and human patients, 4) determine the expression discrepancy of OMP-nMGs in brain tissues of cuprizone-treated mice, multiple sclerosis patients, and normal controls, and 5) conduct literature data mining to explore OMP-nMG-associated disease impacts. By contrasting OMP-nMGs with other genes, OMP-nMGs were found to be more ubiquitously expressed (59.1% vs. 16.1%), disease-associated (67.3% vs. 20.2%), and evolutionarily conserved within the human populations. Our multiomics-based analysis identified 110 OMP-nMGs implicated in energy production and lipid and glycan biosynthesis in the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of demyelinating disorders. Future targeted characterization of OMP-nMGs in abnormal myelination conditions may allow the discovery of novel nMG mediated mechanisms underlying myelinogenesis and related diseases. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.</p>"

The blockade of potassium (K+) channels has demonstrated the ability to improve conduction deficiencies secondary to neuronal demyelination in patients with multiple sclerosis. We modified the well-known cuprizone model of demyelination to evaluate the protective effect of newly synthesized 4-AP derivatives. The results show that cuprizone, administered with the drinking water (0.2% concentration) for a period of 6 weeks to 16-week-old male mice leads to the induction of detectable demyelination in corpus callosum. The investigated compounds antagonize the cuprizone-induced demyelination to a different degree. © 2020 Academic Publishing House. All rights reserved.</p>"
282,2-s2.0-85100279834,Increasing progenitor cell proliferation in the sub-ventricular zone: A therapeutic treatment for progressive multiple sclerosis?,"<p>Introduction: The purpose of this study was to determine if pharmacological treatment could increase progenitor cell proliferation in the Sub-ventricular Zone of aged rats. Previous work had shown that increasing progenitor cell proliferation in this region correlated well (R2=0.78; p= 0.0007) with functional recovery in a damaged corpus callosum (white matter tract), suggesting that progenitor cell proliferation results in oligodendrocytes in this region. Methods: 10 month old male and female Sprague Dawley rats were fed the drugs for 30 days in cook-ie dough, then immunocytochemistry was performed on coronal brain sections, using Ki67 labeling to determine progenitor cell proliferation. Results: Female rats showed low endogenous (control) progenitor cell proliferation, significantly different from male rats (P&lt;0.0001), at this age. Ascorbic Acid (20 mg/kg, daily for 30 days) increased progenitor cell proliferation overall, but maintained the innate gender difference in stem cell proliferation (P=0.001). Prozac (5 mg/kg, daily for 30 days) increased progenitor cell proliferation for females but decreased stem cell proliferation for males, again showing a gender difference (P&lt;0.0001). Simvastatin (1 mg/kg for 30 days) also increased progenitor cell proliferation in females and decreased progenitor cell proliferation in males, leading to a significant gender difference. Discussion: The three drug combinations (fluoxetine, simvastatin, and ascorbic acid, patent # 9,254,281) led to ~ 4 fold increase in progenitor cell proliferation in females, while male progenitor cell proliferation was highest with 50 mg/kg ascorbic acid. However, the ascorbic acid increase in proliferation appears to be only on the sides of the ventricles, which is not the region that normally gives rise to oligodendrocytes. Conclusion: There are innate gender differences in progenitor cell proliferation at the Sub-Ventricular Zone at middle age in rats, possibly due to the loss of estrogen in females. We also see notable gender differences in progenitor cell proliferation in the Sub ventricular Zone in response to common drugs, such as fluoxetine, simvastatin and Vitamin C (ascorbic acid). © 2020 Bentham Science Publishers.</p>"

284,2-s2.0-85099055960,Recommendations of the polish medical society of radiology and the polish society of neurology for a protocol concerning routinely used magnetic resonance imaging in patients with multiple sclerosis,"<p>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a widely used method for the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis (MS) that is essential for the detection and follow-up of the disease. The Polish Medical Society of Radiology (PLTR) and the Polish Society of Neurology (PTN) present the second version of their recommendations for investigations routinely conducted in MRI departments in patients with multiple sclerosis. This version includes new data and practical comments for electroradiology technologists and radiologists. The recommended protocol aims to improve the MRI procedure and, most importantly, to standardise the method of conducting scans in all MRI departments. This is crucial for the initial diagnostics necessary for establishing a diagnosis, as well as for MS patient monitoring, which directly translates into significant clinical decisions. MS is a chronic immune mediated inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS), the aetiology of which is still unknown. The nature of the disease lies in a CNS destruction process disseminated in time and space. MRI detects focal lesions in the white and grey matter with high sensitivity (although with significantly lower specificity in the latter). It is also the best tool to assess brain atrophy in patients with MS in terms of grey matter volume and white matter volume as well as local atrophy (by measuring the volume of thalamus, corpus callosum, subcortical nuclei, and hippocampus) as parameters that correlate with disability progression and cognitive dysfunctions. Progress in MR techniques, as well as advances in postprocessing the obtained data, has driven the dynamic development of computer programs that allow for a more repeatable assessment of brain atrophy in both cross-sectional and longitudinal studies. MRI is unquestionably the best diagnostic tool available to follow up the course of the disease and support clinicians in choosing the most appropriate treatment strategy for their MS patient. However, to diagnose and follow up MS patients on the basis of MRI in accordance with the latest standards, the MRI study must adhere to certain quality criteria. Such criteria are the subject of this paper. © Pol J Radiol 2020.</p>"
285,2-s2.0-85097297540,"Factors influencing daily treatment choices in multiple sclerosis: practice guidelines, biomarkers and burden of disease","<p>At two meetings of a Central European board of multiple sclerosis (MS) experts in 2018 and 2019 factors influencing daily treatment choices in MS, especially practice guidelines, biomarkers and burden of disease, were discussed. The heterogeneity of MS and the complexity of the available treatment options call for informed treatment choices. However, evidence from clinical trials is generally lacking, particularly regarding sequencing, switches and escalation of drugs. Also, there is a need to identify patients who require highly efficacious treatment from the onset of their disease to prevent deterioration. The recently published European Committee for the Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis/European Academy of Neurology clinical practice guidelines on pharmacological management of MS cover aspects such as treatment efficacy, response criteria, strategies to address suboptimal response and safety concerns and are based on expert consensus statements. However, the recommendations constitute an excellent framework that should be adapted to local regulations, MS center capacities and infrastructure. Further, available and emerging biomarkers for treatment guidance were discussed. Magnetic resonance imaging parameters are deemed most reliable at present, even though complex assessment including clinical evaluation and laboratory parameters besides imaging is necessary in clinical routine. Neurofilament-light chain levels appear to represent the current most promising non-imaging biomarker. Other immunological data, including issues of immunosenescence, will play an increasingly important role for future treatment algorithms. Cognitive impairment has been recognized as a major contribution to MS disease burden. Regular evaluation of cognitive function is recommended in MS patients, although no specific disease-modifying treatment has been defined to date. Finally, systematic documentation of real-life data is recognized as a great opportunity to tackle unresolved daily routine challenges, such as use of sequential therapies, but requires joint efforts across clinics, governments and pharmaceutical companies. © The Author(s), 2020.</p>"

Its presence warrants a thorough evaluation to search for demyelinating, mass effect, inflammatory, or infectious etiologies. A 15-year-old African American girl presented to the Emergency Department with acute horizontal binocular diplopia in left gaze. An ophthalmic examination revealed a right INO. She denied any fever, chills, or neck stiffness. Complete blood counts and a metabolic panel were unremarkable. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and orbits revealed scattered pontine, periventricular, and subcortical white matter signal abnormalities within the left frontal lobe suggestive of active demyelination. MRI of the spinal column also demonstrated multiple areas of increased signal intensity from the C3 to C7–T1 region. Inflammatory and autoimmune studies were negative. However, her serum IgM and IgG studies were positive for Borrelia burgdorferi with negative CSF titers. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis demonstrated mildly elevated glucose (82 mg/dL) and oligoclonal bands, but was otherwise unremarkable. She was started on intravenous methylprednisolone and ceftriaxone. She was subsequently diagnosed with pediatric-onset multiple sclerosis and started on disease-modifying therapy, with full resolution of diplopia and INO 2 weeks later. We present a case of INO presenting as the first manifestation of multiple sclerosis in a pediatric patient with a concurrent infectious etiology. A thorough evaluation can lead to earlier identification and treatment of underlying diseases. © Am J Case Rep, 2020;.</p>"

To evaluate the viability of FMT for MS treatment and its impact on MS pathology, we tested FMT in mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a mouse model of MS. We provide evidence that FMT can rectify altered GM to some extent with a therapeutic effect on EAE. We also found that FMT led to reduced activation of microglia and astrocytes and conferred protection on the blood-brain barrier (BBB), myelin, and axons in EAE. Taken together, our data suggest that FMT, as a GM-based therapy, has the potential to be an effective treatment for MS. © 2020 Kanglan Li et al.</p>"
289,2-s2.0-85089423738,Tyrosine Kinase Receptors Axl and MerTK Mediate the Beneficial Effect of Electroacupuncture in a Cuprizone-Induced Demyelinating Model,"<p>Electroacupuncture has been shown to promote remyelination in a demyelinating model of multiple sclerosis (MS) through enhanced microglial clearance of degraded myelin debris. However, the mechanisms involved in this process are yet to be clearly elucidated. It has been revealed that TAM receptor tyrosine kinases (Tyro3, Axl, and MerTK) play pivotal roles in regulating multiple features of microglia, including the phagocytic function and myelin clearance. Therefore, the aim of this study is to further confirm whether electroacupuncture improves functional recovery in this model and to characterise the involvement of the TAM receptor during this process. In addition to naive control mice, a cuprizone-induced demyelinating model was established, and long-term electroacupuncture treatment was administrated. To evaluate the efficiency of functional recovery following demyelination, we performed beam-walking test and rotarod performance test; to objectify the degree of remyelination, we performed transmission electron microscopy and protein quantification of mature oligodendrocyte markers. Oil Red O staining was used to evaluate the deposit of myelin debris. We confirmed that, in cuprizone-treated mice, electroacupuncture significantly ameliorates motor-coordinative dysfunction and counteracts demyelinating processes, with less deposit of myelin debris accumulating in the corpus callosum. Surprisingly, mRNA expression of TAM receptors was significantly upregulated after electroacupuncture treatment, and we further confirmed an increased protein expression of Axl and MerTK after electroacupuncture treatment, indicating their involvement during electroacupuncture treatment. Finally, LDC1267, a selective TAM kinase inhibitor, abolished the therapeutic effect of electroacupuncture on motor-coordinative dysfunction. Overall, our data demonstrate that electroacupuncture could mitigate the progression of demyelination by enhancing the TAM receptor expression to facilitate the clearance of myelin debris. Our results also suggest that electroacupuncture may be a potential curative treatment for MS patients. © 2020 Zaofeng Zou et al.</p>"
290,2-s2.0-85088946231,Coexistence of emotional reactions and atrophic brain changes in patients with clinically isolated syndrome of multiple sclerosis,"<p>Purpose: Atrophic processes of the brain affect the quality of life of patients whose cognitive functions and daily activity are already affected at the stage of the clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) of multiple sclerosis (MS). It is possible that in addition to pathogenic processes, the patient’s emotions at the diagnostic stage can coexist with the course of the disease. We have evaluated the coexistence of emotional reactions in patients with CIS with the formation of atrophic brain changes in patients with MS as well as their association with the functional disability of the patient. Methods: Thirty patients were examined at the CIS stage and during a repeated clinical attack of MS. The patient’s emotional reaction was assessed at the time of the CIS diagnosis and one week later. For the estimation of atrophic processes of the brain, according to the MRI data on its dynamics, 23 linear parameters and 14 indices were used. Results: The corpus callosum index was the most significant area of brain atrophy in a repeated attack of MS. There was a strong correlation between the negative emotional response to the diagnosis (shock and denial) and the degree of atrophy of the corpus callosum during repeated clinical attack of the disease as well as with a greater functional failure of the patient. Patients who reported experiencing anxiety or relief did not show increased atrophy. Conclusions: The emotional response in the form of shock or denial of the diagnosis coexists with corpus callosum atrophy. The patient’s emotional background affects the prognosis and the level of functional disability during the repeated clinical attack. © 2020 Termedia Publishing House Ltd.. All rights reserved.</p>"
291,2-s2.0-85088220770,Corpus callosum index correlates with brain volumetry and disability in multiple sclerosis patients,"<p>Objectives: To analyze the correlation between corpucallosum index (CCI), brain volumetry, and disability in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. The brain volumetry consists of the corpus callosum, corticagray matter, subcortical gray matter, and white mattevolumes. Methods: This was a retrospective cross-sectional study from October 2018 to February 2019 of 30 patients with MS aged 20 to 61 years old. Brain volumetry was performed using FreeSurfer© software. The CCI were measured manually using conventional best mid-sagittal T1W brain MRI. The anterior, posterior, and medium segments were measured and divided to its greatest anteroposterior diameter. Higher CCI values indicated greater corpus callosum volumes. Clinical evaluation was comprised of MS subtype, age of onset, relapse frequency and Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS). Results: Thirty MS patients with median of age 22 years were included. Relapsing-remitting (RRMS) subtype were 73.3%. Very significant correlations were shown between the CCI and corpus callosum volume (CCV) (r=0.79; p&lt;0.0001) and cerebral white matter volume (r=0.81; p&lt;0.0001). Significant correlations were shown between the CCI and cortical gray matter volume (r=0.64; p&lt;0.0001) and subcortical gray matter volume (r=0.69; p&lt;0.0001). The CCI was positively correlated with age of onset and inversely with EDSS. The CCV and CCI were smaller in secondary progressive MS (SPMS). Conclusion: The CCI is easy and fast to obtain in conventional MRI and significantly correlated with brain volumetry, age of onset and disability in MS patients. © 2020, Saudi Arabian Armed Forces Hospital.

Methods: 119 patients with brain atrophy were grouped according to the degree of brain atrophy. Median sagittal CCa and intracranial area (ICa) were measured, and the ratio of corpus callosum to the intracranial area (CCa-ICa ratio) was calculated. The data were analyzed using ANOVA. Results: CCa significantly reduced in patients with cerebral atrophy, and the degree of cerebral atrophy was found to be positively correlated with the degree of reduction in the CCa. Conclusion: The reduction in the CCa and the CCa-ICa ratio in the median sagittal can be used as a reference indicator for the diagnosis and grading of brain atrophy in clinical practice. © 2020 Bentham Science Publishers.</p>"

This study was conducted to determine the differences in clinical and radiological features at the first demyelinating event in children with clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) and multiple sclerosis (MS). Methods. This was a single center retrospective cohort study of the children with CIS followed-up at Istanbul University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Pediatric Neurology, between 2010 and 2018. Children with CIS who were assessed at 3, 6, 12 and 24 months following their first identified demyelinating event were included. Demographic data, mode of presentation and the presence of the oligoclonal band in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were abstracted from the medical records. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and spinal cord was analyzed for the location, number, size and gadolinium enhancement of the lesions. Results. A total of 51 patients’ data was assessed, 38 patients at a mean age of 12.3 years were enrolled in the study. Twenty-seven children (71%) evolved into clinically definite MS after a mean follow-up of 11 months. Older age at first demyelinating event and the presence of the oligoclonal band in CSF were tended to be more common in patients with MS than patients with CIS (p &lt;0.05). The increased number of T2-hyperintense lesion and the presence of the lesion in periventricular, infratentorial and corpus callosum were associated with a tendency for development of MS (p &lt;0.05). Conclusion. Older age at first demyelinating event, the presence of the oligoclonal band in CSF, the number and localization of T2-hyperintense lesion were associated with a tendency for development of MS. © 2020, Turkish Journal of Pediatrics.

294,2-s2.0-85083005775,Proteomic changes during experimental deand remyelination in the corpus callosum,"<p>Background In the cuprizone model of multiple sclerosis, de- and remyelination can be studied without major interference from the adaptive immune responses. Since previous proteomic studies did not focus on the corpus callosum, where cuprizone causes the most pronounced demyelination, we performed a bottom up proteomic analysis on this brain region. Methods Eight week-old mice treated with 0.2% cuprizone, for 4 weeks and controls (C) were sacrificed after termination of the treatment (4wD), and 2 (2dR) or 14 (2wR) days later. Homogenates of dissected corpus callosum were analysed by quantitative proteomics. For data processing, clustering, gene ontology analysis, and regulatory network prediction, we used Perseus, PANTHER and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis softwares, respectively. Results We identified 4886 unmodified, single- or multi phosphorylated and/or gycosylated (PTM) proteins. Out of them, 191 proteins were differentially regulated in at least one experimental group. We found 57 proteins specific for demyelination, 27 for early- and 57 for late remyelinationwhile 36 proteins were affected in two, and 23 proteins in all three groups. Phosphorylation represented 92% of the post translational modifications among differentially regulated modified (PTM) proteins with decreased level, while it was only 30% of the PTM proteins with increased level. Gene ontology analysis could not classify the demyelination specific proteins into any biological process category, while allocated the remyelination specific ones to nervous system development and myelination as the most specific subcategory. We also identified a protein network in experimental remyelination, and the gene orthologues of the network were differentially expressed in remyelinating multiple sclerosis brain lesions consistent with an early remyelination pattern. Conclusion Proteomic analysis seems more informative for remyelination than demyelination in the cuprizone model. © 2020 Szilagyi et al.

Methods: Using bioinformatics analysis of publicly available transcriptomics data, we determined the accumulation of B cells, plasma cells and T cells in different compartments of multiple sclerosis patients (MS) and healthy individual brains. Based on these observations and on the literature search, we dosed RTX in EAE mice either orally, or injected intraperitoneally (IP). The latter route was used either prophylactically (asymptomatic stage; upon the induction of the disease), or therapeutically (acute stage; upon the appearance of the first sign of the disease). Further, we used RTX as a preventive drug either as a single agent or in combination with other routes of administration. Results: Because no complete recovery was observed when RTX was used prophylactically or therapeutically, we devised another protocol of injecting this drug before the onset of the disease and designated this regiment as prevention. We demonstrated that the 20 μg/mouse prevention completely reduced the EAE clinical score, impaired infiltration of T and B cells into the perivascular space of mice brains, along with inhibiting the inflammation and demyelination. However, the 5 and 10 μg/mouse doses although reduced all aspects of inflammation in these mice, their effects were not as potent as the 20 μg/mouse RTX dose. Finally, we combined the 5 μg/mouse prevention treatment with either the prophylactic or therapeutic regimen and observed a robust effect. Conclusion: We observed that combinatorial regimens resulted in further reduction of inflammation, T and B cell extravasation into the brains of EAE mice and improved the re-myelination. © 2020 Al-ani et al.</p>"
296,2-s2.0-85076345086,Vitamin D increases remyelination by promoting oligodendrocyte lineage differentiation,"<p>Introduction: Several experimental studies have suggested the potential remyelinating effects of vitamin D (VitD) supplements regardless of the presence of VitD deficiency. This study aims to analyze neurogenesis in a model of toxic demyelination in order to evaluate the effects of VitD on demyelination and remyelination. Material and methods: We used 24 male Wistar rats that had received surgical lesions to the corpus callosum and were injected with lysolecithin. Rats were divided into three groups: Group 1 included eight rats with lesions to the corpus callosum but not lysolecithin injections (sham group), group 2 included eight rats with lesions to the corpus callosum that were injected with lysolecithin (lysolecithin group), and group 3 included eight rats with lesions that were injected with lysolecithin and received VitD (VitD group). We analyzed neurogenesis both in the subventricular zone and at the lesion site. Results: Administration of VitD promotes the proliferation and differentiation of neural stem cells in the subventricular zone and the migration of these cells to the lesion site in the corpus callosum; these cells subsequently differentiate into oligodendrocyte lineage cells and produce myelin basic protein. This phenomenon was not caused by microglial activation, which was less marked in rats receiving VitD. Megalin expression did not increase at the lesion site, which suggests that VitD is internalized by other mechanisms. Conclusion: Our results support the hypothesis that regardless of the presence of VitD deficiency, treatment with VitD may contribute to remyelination by promoting the proliferation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells. © 2019 The Authors.

In this work, normative values for longitudinal and transverse relaxation times in the brain were established and tested in single-subject comparisons for detection of abnormal relaxation times. Methods: Relaxometry maps of the brain were acquired from 52 healthy volunteers. After spatially normalizing the volumes into a common space, T<sub>1</sub> and T<sub>2</sub> inter-subject variability within the healthy cohort was modeled voxel-wise. A method for a single-subject comparison against the atlases was developed by computing z-scores with respect to the established healthy norms. The comparison was applied to two multiple sclerosis and one clinically isolated syndrome cases for a proof of concept. Results: The established atlases exhibit a low variation in white matter structures (median RMSE of models equal to 32 ms for T<sub>1</sub> and 4 ms for T<sub>2</sub>), indicating that relaxation times are in a narrow range for normal tissues. The proposed method for single-subject comparison detected relaxation time deviations from healthy norms in the example patient data sets. Relaxation times were found to be increased in brain lesions (mean z-scores &gt;5). Moreover, subtle and confluent differences (z-scores ~2–4) were observed in clinically plausible regions (between lesions, corpus callosum). Conclusions: Brain T<sub>1</sub> and T<sub>2</sub> quantitative norms were derived voxel-wise with low variability in healthy tissue. Example patient deviation maps demonstrated good sensitivity of the atlases for detecting relaxation time alterations. © 2019 International Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine</p>"

Cuprizone (cup) animal model of MS targets OLGs degeneration and frequently used to the mechanistic understanding of de- and remyelination. The aim of this study was exploring the effects of metformin on the OLGs regeneration, myelin repair and profile of neurotrophic factors in the mice brain after cup-induced acute demyelination. Methods: Mice (C57BL/6 J) were fed with chow containing 0.2% cup for 5 weeks to induce specific OLGs degeneration and acute demyelination. Next, the cup was withdrawn to allow one-week recovery (spontaneous remyelination). At the end of this period, mature OLGs markers, myelin-associated neurite outgrowth inhibitor protein A (NogoA), premature specific OLGs transcription factor (Olig2), anti-apoptosis marker (survivin), neurotrophic factors, and AMPK activation were monitored in the presence or absence of metformin (50 mg/kg body weight/day) in the corpus callosum (CC). Results: Our finding indicated that consumption of metformin during the recovery period potentially induced an active form of AMPK (p-AMPK) and promoted repopulation of mature OLGs (MOG<sup>+</sup> cells, MBP<sup>+</sup> cells) in CC through up-regulation of BDNF, CNTF, and NGF as well as down-regulation of NogoA and recruitment of Olig2<sup>+</sup> precursor cells. Conclusions: This study for the first time reveals that metformin-induced AMPK, a master regulator of energy homeostasis, activation following toxic demyelination could potentially accelerate regeneration and supports spontaneous demyelination. These findings suggest the development of new therapeutic strategies based on AMPK activation for MS in the near future.

299,2-s2.0-85071957332,Diffusion tensor imaging for assessment of normally appearing white matter of the brain and spinal cord in cases of multiple sclerosis: a multi-parametric correlation in view of patient’s clinical status,"<p>Background: Conventional MRI provides important morphologic information regarding the brain and spinal cord involvement by demyelinating plaques. However, it is of almost no value in assessing the normal-appearing white matter which has been proved by multiple pathologic studies to be directly and indirectly involved in the process of multiple sclerosis. Diffusion-weighted imaging and diffusion tensor imaging MRI have been widely used in multiple researches as a better solution for studying the normal-appearing white matter. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the role of diffusion tensor imaging examination of the normal-appearing white matter of the brain and spinal cord in patients with multiple sclerosis and to determine the relationship between diffusion tensor imaging metrics and patient’s clinical status. Results: The significant negative correlation found between expanded disability status scale score of secondary progressive MS patients and global (brain and spinal cord) average fractional anisotropy values in normal-appearing white matter and tracts (P = 0.000). Correlation between average apparent diffusion coefficient of corpus callosum tract and expanded disability status scale score revealed a significant positive correlation in RRMS (P = 0.001). While in secondary progressive MS, a significant negative correlation between fractional anisotropy average of the corpus callosum tract and expanded disability status scale score was noted (P = 0.015). Conclusion: There is a strong relationship between diffusion tensor imaging readings and clinical status of patients can be used to understand unexplained deterioration over disease course and also can be used when conventional MRI findings are equivocal. Corpus callosum affection in MS patients is intimately related to clinical status and its assessment should be done whenever possible. © 2019, The Author(s).</p>"

Associations between brain imaging measures and cognitive functioning have been observed in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). Objectives: To evaluate cognitive dysfunction and physical disability in MS patients by making correlation between magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), MoCA test, and Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS). Methods: Fifty MS patients and 25 controls underwent clinical evaluation and assessment of cognitive functions using the MoCA test. In addition, all MS patients underwent conventional MRI brain and Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS). Results: The scores for trail making test, memory, attention, serial seven subtractions, fluency, naming, and orientation in MS patients were significantly different from control (p &lt; 0.05). There was significant inverse correlation between number of MS plaques in the temporal lobe and abstraction (p &lt; 0.001, r = − 0.52). Less inverse correlation was found between total number of MRI plaques and concentration, total number of MRI plaques and abstraction, and infratentorial lesions and clock drawing test. No correlations were found between the number of MS plaques in frontal, parietal, occipital, corpus callosum, and neuropsychological tests. Conclusion: Although conventional MRI techniques are crucial in the MS diagnostic workup, their accuracy in evaluating and predicting cognitive dysfunction is less relevant.

301,2-s2.0-85069947013,Detrimental and protective action of microglial extracellular vesicles on myelin lesions: astrocyte involvement in remyelination failure,"<p>Microglia are highly plastic immune cells which exist in a continuum of activation states. By shaping the function of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs), the brain cells which differentiate to myelin-forming cells, microglia participate in both myelin injury and remyelination during multiple sclerosis. However, the mode(s) of action of microglia in supporting or inhibiting myelin repair is still largely unclear. Here, we analysed the effects of extracellular vesicles (EVs) produced in vitro by either pro-inflammatory or pro-regenerative microglia on OPCs at demyelinated lesions caused by lysolecithin injection in the mouse corpus callosum. Immunolabelling for myelin proteins and electron microscopy showed that EVs released by pro-inflammatory microglia blocked remyelination, whereas EVs produced by microglia co-cultured with immunosuppressive mesenchymal stem cells promoted OPC recruitment and myelin repair. The molecular mechanisms responsible for the harmful and beneficial EV actions were dissected in primary OPC cultures. By exposing OPCs, cultured either alone or with astrocytes, to inflammatory EVs, we observed a blockade of OPC maturation only in the presence of astrocytes, implicating these cells in remyelination failure. Biochemical fractionation revealed that astrocytes may be converted into harmful cells by the inflammatory EV cargo, as indicated by immunohistochemical and qPCR analyses, whereas surface lipid components of EVs promote OPC migration and/or differentiation, linking EV lipids to myelin repair. Although the mechanisms through which the lipid species enhance OPC maturation still remain to be fully defined, we provide the first demonstration that vesicular sphingosine 1 phosphate stimulates OPC migration, the first fundamental step in myelin repair. From this study, microglial EVs emerge as multimodal and multitarget signalling mediators able to influence both OPCs and astrocytes around myelin lesions, which may be exploited to develop novel approaches for myelin repair not only in multiple sclerosis, but also in neurological and neuropsychiatric diseases characterized by demyelination. © 2019, The Author(s).</p>"
302,2-s2.0-85067261153,Central nervous system targeted autoimmunity causes regional atrophy: a 9.4T MRI study of the EAE mouse model of Multiple Sclerosis,"<p>Atrophy has become a clinically relevant marker of progressive neurodegeneration in multiple sclerosis (MS). To better understand atrophy, mouse models that feature atrophy along with other aspects of MS are needed. The experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mouse model of MS was used to determine the extent of atrophy in a model of inflammation-associated central nervous system pathology. High-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and atlas-based volumetric analysis were performed to measure brain regional volumes in EAE mice. EAE brains were larger at peak clinical disease (days 14–16) compared to controls, with affected regions including the cerebellum, hippocampus, and corpus callosum. Following peak clinical disease, EAE mice exhibited significant loss of volume at chronic long-term disease duration (day 66+). Atrophy was identified in both white and grey matter regions including the cerebral cortex, cerebellum, hippocampus, corpus callosum, basal forebrain, midbrain, optic tract, and colliculus. Histological analysis of the atrophied cortex, cerebellum, and hippocampus showed demyelination, and axonal/neuronal loss. We hypothesize this atrophy could be a result of inflammatory associated neurodegenerative processes, which may also be involved in MS. Using MRI and atlas-based volumetrics, EAE has the potential to be a test bed for treatments aimed at reducing progressive neurological deterioration in MS. © 2019, The Author(s).</p>"
303,2-s2.0-85066154163,Enhanced remyelination during late pregnancy: involvement of the GABAergic system,"<p>Pregnant women with MS experience fewer relapses, especially during the third trimester. In this study, we explore the cellular and molecular events that bring about the protective effect of late pregnancy on the course of de/remyelination in rats. Using cellular, molecular, and ultrastructural methods, we explored remyelination in response to a focal demyelination in the corpus callosum of late pregnant, virgin, and postpartum rats. We further explored the role of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor (GABA<sub>A</sub>R) in the promyelinating effect observed during late pregnancy. Remyelination in response to a gliotoxin-induced demyelination in the corpus callosum was enhanced in late pregnant rats when compared to that seen in virgin and postpartum rats. This pregnancy-associated promyelinating effect was lost when either the GABA<sub>A</sub>R was blocked or when 5α-reductase, the rate limiting enzyme for the endogenous GABA<sub>A</sub>R activator allopregnanolone, was inhibited. Taken together, these data suggest that the pregnancy-associated pro-myelination operates, at least in part, through a GABAergic activated system. © 2019, The Author(s).</p>"

Purpose: To investigate the sensitivity of multiparametric MRI both in vivo and ex vivo for demyelination and remyelination. Study Type: Prospective. Animal Model: A cuprizone mice model with an age-matched control group (n = 5), 4-week cuprizone exposure group followed by 9-week on a normal diet (n = 6), and a 13-week cuprizone exposure group (n = 6). Field Strength/Sequence: 3D gradient recalled echo, T<sub>2</sub>-weighted, and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) at 7.0T and 9.4T. Assessment: Quantification of DTI metrics, quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM), and T<sub>2</sub>-weighted imaging intensity in major white matter bundles. Statistical Tests: Nonparametric permutation tests were used with a cluster-forming threshold as 3.09 (equivalent to P = 0.001), and the significant level as P = 0.05 with family-wise correction. Results: In vivo susceptibility values increased from –11.7 to –0.7 ppb (P &lt; 0.001) in CC and from –13.7 to –5.1 ppb (P &lt; 0.001) in the anterior commissure (AC) after the 13-week cuprizone exposure. Ex vivo susceptibility values increased from –25.4 to 7.4 ppb (P &lt; 0.001) in CC and from –41.6 to –15.8 ppb (P &lt; 0.001) in AC. Susceptibility values showed high variations to demyelination for in vivo studies (94.0% in CC, 62.8% in AC). Susceptibility values exhibited higher variations than radial diffusivity for ex vivo studies (129.1% vs. 28.3% in CC, 62.0% vs. 25.0% in AC). In addition to the differential susceptibility variations in different white matter tracts, intraregional demyelination variation was also present not only in CC but also in the AC area by voxel-based analysis. Data Conclusion: QSM is sensitive to the demyelination process of cuprizone exposure, which can be a complementary technique to conventional T<sub>2</sub>-weighted images and DTI metrics.

305,2-s2.0-85062875141,Transcriptional profiling of human microglia reveals grey–white matter heterogeneity and multiple sclerosis-associated changes,"<p>Here we report the transcriptional profile of human microglia, isolated from normal-appearing grey matter (GM) and white matter (WM) of multiple sclerosis (MS) and non-neurological control donors, to find possible early changes related to MS pathology. Microglia show a clear region-specific profile, indicated by higher expression of type-I interferon genes in GM and higher expression of NF-κB pathway genes in WM. Transcriptional changes in MS microglia also differ between GM and WM. MS WM microglia show increased lipid metabolism gene expression, which relates to MS pathology since active MS lesion-derived microglial nuclei show similar altered gene expression. Microglia from MS GM show increased expression of genes associated with glycolysis and iron homeostasis, possibly reflecting microglia reacting to iron depositions. Except for ADGRG1/GPR56, expression of homeostatic genes, such as P2RY12 and TMEM119, is unaltered in normal-appearing MS tissue, demonstrating overall preservation of microglia homeostatic functions in the initiation phase of MS. © 2019, The Author(s).</p>"
306,2-s2.0-85060925849,Acute and chronic demyelinated CNS lesions exhibit opposite elastic properties,"<p>Increased deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM) is a known inhibitor of axonal regrowth and remyelination. Recent in vitro studies have demonstrated that oligodendrocyte differentiation is impacted by the physical properties of the ECM. However, characterization of the mechanical properties of the healthy and injured CNS myelin is challenging, and has largely relied on non-invasive, low-resolution methods. To address this, we have employed atomic force microscopy to perform micro-indentation measurements of demyelinated tissue at cellular scale. Analysis of mouse and human demyelinated brains indicate that acute demyelination results in decreased tissue stiffness that recovers with remyelination; while chronic demyelination is characterized by increased tissue stiffness, which correlates with augmented ECM deposition. Thus, changes in the mechanical properties of the acutely (softer) or chronically (stiffer) demyelinated brain might contribute to differences in their regenerative capacity. Our findings are relevant to the optimization of cell-based therapies aimed at promoting CNS regeneration and remyelination. © 2019, The Author(s).</p>"
307,2-s2.0-85060530303,Analogues of ERβ ligand chloroindazole exert immunomodulatory and remyelinating effects in a mouse model of multiple sclerosis,"<p>Pharmaceutical agents currently approved for the treatment of multiple sclerosis reduce relapse rates, but do not reverse or prevent neurodegeneration nor initiate myelin repair. The highly selective estrogen receptor (ER) β ligand chloroindazole (IndCl) shows particular promise promoting both remyelination while reducing inflammatory cytokines in the central nervous system of mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. To optimize these benefits, we developed and screened seven novel IndCl analogues for their efficacy in promoting primary oligodendrocyte (OL) progenitor cell survival, proliferation, and differentiation in vitro by immunohistochemistry. Two analogues, IndCl-o-chloro and IndCl-o-methyl, induced proliferation and differentiation equivalent to IndCl and were selected for subsequent in vivo evaluation for their impact on clinical disease course, white matter pathology, and inflammation. Both compounds ameliorated disease severity, increased mature OLs, and improved overall myelination in the corpus callosum and white matter tracts of the spinal cord. These effects were accompanied by reduced production of the OL toxic molecules interferon-γ and chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand, CXCL10 by splenocytes with no discernable effect on central nervous system-infiltrating leukocyte numbers, while IndCl-o-methyl also reduced peripheral interleukin (IL)−17. In addition, expression of the chemokine CXCL1, which is associated with developmental oligodendrogenesis, was upregulated by IndCl and both analogues. Furthermore, callosal compound action potential recordings from analogue-treated mice demonstrated a larger N1 component amplitude compared to vehicle, suggesting more functionally myelinated fibers. Thus, the o-Methyl and o-Chloro IndCl analogues represent a class of ERβ ligands that offer significant remyelination and neuroprotection as well as modulation of the immune system; hence, they appear appropriate to consider further for therapeutic development in multiple sclerosis and other demyelinating diseases. © 2019, The Author(s).</p>"

Longitudinal TBSS analyses of early multiple sclerosis (MS) using 3 Tesla magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are not common. Objective: To characterize microstructural WM alterations at initial diagnosis in clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) and early MS at baseline and longitudinally over 2 years. Methods: DTI (Diffusion tensor imaging) at 3 Tesla was used to evaluate 106 therapy-naive patients with CIS or definite MS at baseline and at 1-year (N = 83) and 2-year (N = 43) follow-up compared to healthy controls (HC, N = 49). TBSS was used for voxel-wise analyses of the DTI indices of fractional anisotropy (FA) and radial, mean, and axial diffusivity (RD, MD, AD) for cross-sectional and longitudinal comparisons. Mean values of FA, RD, and cluster voxel numbers were extracted from significant clusters using an atlas-based approach. Correlations with disability (EDSS) were calculated for FA and RD changes related to affected brain regions. Results: Reductions in FA compared to HC were found at baseline in patients with CIS and RRMS and involved most supra- and infratentorial WM tracts. In the cerebellum and cerebral peduncles, these changes negatively correlated with EDSS after 2 years. FA changes in patients with CIS and RRMS evolved in the second year, particularly in the descending projection pathways and the cerebellum, and were significantly associated with EDSS. RD alterations compared to HC were undetectable in patients at baseline but were observed after 1 year and were exacerbated during the second year in all major supratentorial WM tracts, the corpus callosum, and the cerebellum. FA did not change between baseline and year 1 follow-up, but longitudinal investigation between the first and second year revealed combined dynamic FA and RD changes in the corpus callosum and corona radiata. Conclusion: TBSS of diffusion metrics at initial diagnosis and at 2-year follow-up showed microstructural WM pathology and associations between FA reduction and future disability, respectively. Combined longitudinal changes in FA and RD occurred in specific structures, where RD increases likely reflected progressing axonal degeneration. The distinct temporal dynamics of FA and RD, implying constancy during the first year, supports early therapeutic intervention for CIS and RRMS. © Copyright © 2019 Schneider, Genç, Ahlborn, Gold, Lukas and Bellenberg.</p>"
309,2-s2.0-85073990672,Diffusion basis spectrum imaging for identifying pathologies in MS subtypes,"<p>Diffusion basis spectrum imaging (DBSI) combines discrete anisotropic diffusion tensors and the spectrum of isotropic diffusion tensors to model the underlying multiple sclerosis (MS) pathologies. We used clinical MS subtypes as a surrogate of underlying pathologies to assess DBSI as a biomarker of pathology in 55 individuals with MS. Restricted isotropic fraction (reflecting cellularity) and fiber fraction (representing apparent axonal density) were the most important DBSI metrics to classify MS using brain white matter lesions. These DBSI metrics outperformed lesion volume. When analyzing the normal-appearing corpus callosum, the most significant DBSI metrics were fiber fraction, radial diffusivity (reflecting myelination), and nonrestricted isotropic fraction (representing edema). This study provides preliminary evidence supporting the ability of DBSI as a potential noninvasive biomarker of MS neuropathology. © 2019 The Authors.

310,2-s2.0-85073962264,Reversible lesion in the splenium of the corpus callosum,"<p>Aim of Review: The presence of isolated, reversible lesions in the splenium of the corpus callosum (SCC) is essential to confirm the diagnosis of mild encephalitis/encephalopathy. The lesions usually heal within a month after the onset of neurological symptoms. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has increasingly been used as a diagnostic tool, which has led to the publication of an increasing number of case reports. These have highlighted some inconsistencies about encephalitis/encephalopathy. First, the condition is not always mild and may be severe. Second, reversible lesions in the SCC have been identified in various diseases and conditions other than viral encephalitis/encephalopathy. Third, lesions in SCC are not always completely reversible. On this note, this review describes the specific clinical and radiological features of encephalitis/encephalopathy. Findings: The reversible lesion in SCC is an MRI finding observable in a wide variety of diseases and conditions. Thus, it should be considered as a secondary change rather than a peculiar feature associated with mild encephalitis/encephalopathy. If reversible lesions are present in the SCC, the symptoms and prognosis are not necessarily favorable, with manifestations of encephalitis/encephalopathy varying from absent to severe. Neuroradiological features that appear as isolated high-intensity signals on diffusion-weighted images and a decreased apparent diffusion coefficient of the lesion might indicate a diagnosis of cytotoxic edema. Findings of previous studies suggest that cytokine-mediated cytotoxic edema of the SCC may be an important pathophysiological manifestation of this condition. Conclusion: The reversible lesions in the SCC found on MRI are not exclusive to encephalitis/encephalopathy but may be secondary to other disorders. © 2019 The Authors.

Improperly, this classic model is time-consuming and the extent of brain lesions and behavioral deficits are changeable (both temporally and spatially) within a mouse strain. We aimed to offer an alternative, less time-consuming, and more reproducible cup model. Mice (C57BL/6) were treated with cup (400 mg kg<sup>−1</sup> day<sup>−1</sup>/gavage) for three consecutive weeks to induce OLGs degeneration with or without YM155 (1 mg kg<sup>−1</sup> day<sup>−1</sup>) to examine the effects of this molecule in cup neurotoxicity. Co-administration of cup and YM155 (cuYM) accelerated the intrinsic apoptosis of mature OLGs (MOG positive cells) through the upregulation of caspase-9 and caspase-3. In addition to the stimulation of oxidative stress via reduction of glutathione peroxidase and induction of malondialdehyde, behavioral deficits in both Open-field and Rota-rod tests were worsened by cuYM. In the cuYM group, the expression of BIRC5, BIRC4 and NAIP was reduced, but no significant changes were observed in the abundance of the other inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (cIAP1 and cIAP2) in comparison with the cup group. Moreover, in silico analysis validated that YM155 directly interrupts the binding sites of certain transcription factors, such as krüppel-like family (Klf), specificity proteins (SPs), myeloid zinc fingers (MZFs), zinc finger proteins (ZNFPs), and transcription factor activating enhancer-binding proteins (TFAPs), on the promoters of target genes. In conclusion, this modified model promotes cup-induced redox and apoptosis signaling, elevates behavioral deficits, saves time, minimizes variations, and can be employed for early evaluation of novel neuroprotective agents in oligodendropathies. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.</p>"
312,2-s2.0-85070296943,Myelin Water Atlas: A Template for Myelin Distribution in the Brain,"<p>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Myelin water imaging (MWI) is a magnetic resonance imaging technique that quantifies myelin in-vivo. Although MWI has been extensively applied to study myelin-related diseases in groups, clinical use in individual patients is challenging mainly due to population heterogeneity. The purpose of this study was twofold: (1) create a normative brain myelin water atlas depicting the population mean and regional variability of myelin content; and (2) apply the myelin atlas to assess the degree of demyelination in individuals with multiple sclerosis (MS). METHODS: 3T MWI was performed on 50 healthy adults (25 M/25 F, mean age 25 years [range 17-42 years]). The myelin water atlas was created by averaging coregistered myelin water fraction (MWF) maps from all healthy individuals. To illustrate the preliminary utility of the atlas, white matter (WM) regional MWF variations were evaluated and voxel-wise z-score maps (z &lt; −1.96) from the MWI of three MS participants were produced to assess individually the degree of demyelination. RESULTS: The myelin water atlas demonstrated significant MWF variation across control WM. No significant MWF differences were found between male and female healthy participants. MS z-score maps revealed diffuse regions of demyelination in the two participants with Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) = 2.0 but not in the participant with EDSS = 0. CONCLUSIONS: The myelin water atlas can be used as a reference (URL: https://sourceforge.net/projects/myelin-water-atlas/) to demonstrate areas of demyelination in individual MS participants. Future studies will expand the atlas age range, account for education, and other variables that may affect myelination. © 2019 by the American Society of Neuroimaging</p>"
313,2-s2.0-85069897287,The Spatial and Temporal Characters of Demyelination and Remyelination in the Cuprizone Animal Model,"<p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common central nervous system disease due to demyelination in young adults, and currently, there is no cure. Some experimental animal models were generated to mimic specific aspects of MS pathological characteristics. Among them, the cuprizone (CPZ)-induced mouse demyelination model presents heterogeneous pathologies with both focal and diffuse lesions. Considering that MS is a progressive disease, it is important to study the spatial and temporal characters of de- and remyelination in MS animal models. However, such data especially in some brain regions such as lateral septal area, fimbria of hippocampus, and hippocampus are still lacking. In this study, we investigated the alterations of myelin in these areas in parallel to the changes in corpus callosum using coronal sections. We found that the progression of demyelinating varied in different brain regions in C57BL/6J mice treated with CPZ for 1 to 5 weeks. This result suggests that each brain region has a distinct sensitivity to CPZ intoxication. Interestingly, activated microglia appeared not only in the active demyelinating areas but also in the non-myelinolysis regions. After CPZ withdrawal, significant remyelination was started in corpus callosum as early as 3 days. The completion of remyelination in the entire brain regions took 3 weeks. Our study detailed characterized the dynamics of myelin alterations and microglial status in the brain of the CPZ model. This information is valuable to facilitate further MS studies utilizing the CPZ model.

314,2-s2.0-85063592392,"Donepezil, a drug for Alzheimer’s disease, promotes oligodendrocyte generation and remyelination","<p>Myelin sheaths play important roles in neuronal functions. In the central nervous system (CNS), the myelin is formed by oligodendrocytes (OLs), which are differentiated from oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs). In CNS demyelinating disorders such as multiple sclerosis (MS), the myelin sheaths are damaged and the remyelination process is hindered. Small molecule drugs that promote OPC to OL differentiation and remyelination may provide a new way to treat these demyelinating diseases. Here we report that donepezil, an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor (AChEI) developed for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), significantly promotes OPC to OL differentiation. Interestingly, other AChEIs, including huperzine A, rivastigmine, and tacrine, have no such effect, indicating that donepezil’s effect in promoting OPC differentiation is not dependent on the inhibition of AChE. Donepezil also facilitates the formation of myelin sheaths in OPC–DRG neuron co-culture. More interestingly, donepezil also promotes the repair of the myelin sheaths in vivo and provides significant therapeutic effect in a cuprizone-mediated demyelination animal model. Donepezil is a drug that has been used to treat AD safely for many years; our findings suggest that it might be repurposed to treat CNS demyelinating diseases such as MS by promoting OPC to OL differentiation and remyelination. © 2019, CPS and SIMM.</p>"
315,2-s2.0-85055517214,Clinical spectrum of inflammatory central nervous system demyelinating disorders associated with antibodies against myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein,"<p>Immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies against myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) are detected in the serum of some patients with demyelinating diseases. These patients are known to show repeated clinical episodes of inflammatory demyelinating attacks in the central nervous system. Although the associated pathogenicity and mechanism of inflammatory demyelination remains inconclusive, it is known that patients with MOG-IgG antibodies have a different clinical spectrum from those with other demyelinating diseases, such as multiple sclerosis. Based on our database of 85 MOG-IgG positive (+) cases, the most frequently associated clinical episodes were isolated optic neuritis (67.5%), encephalitis (26.5%), and myelitis (19.3%). Optic neuritis in MOG-IgG (+) disease usually involves the long segment of optic nerves and sometimes happens bilaterally, but visual acuity usually recovers with proper treatment in the acute phase. Brain and brainstem lesions usually present vague and focal appearances with irregular margins, typically in subcortical or brainstem regions, but occasionally in the cortex or corpus callosum. Due to these characteristics, MOG-IgG (+) cases with brain or brainstem lesions are sometimes diagnosed with acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, meningitis, or symptomatic epilepsy. The myelitis in MOG-IgG (+) typically shows longitudinally extensive lesions as seen in neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders. Acute treatment to reduce attack-related disability is recommended in MOG-IgG (+) disease, and long-term immunosuppression may be considered in patients with a high frequency of relapses and/or high risk of neurological disability. © 2018</p>"
316,2-s2.0-85074145073,Myelin Water Imaging and Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation Suggest Structure-Function Relationships in Multiple Sclerosis,"<p>Demyelination can be assessed structurally by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and functionally with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Here, we combined these techniques to investigate demyelination of the corpus callosum in multiple sclerosis (MS). Our objective was to determine if corpus callosal demyelination impacts transcallosal inhibition (TCI). TCI is a brief suppression of voluntary activity in the primary motor cortex elicited by stimulation of the homologous region of the contralateral hemisphere, which is assumed to be transmitted via the corpus callosum. MRI and TMS were performed in 26 participants with MS and 10 controls. Myelin water fraction (MWF) was measured in five regions of the corpus callosum and compared with the onset latency, duration, and depth of TCI as measured by electromyography at the forearm. Callosal MWF was greatest posteriorly compared to other regions of the corpus callosum. Lower MWF in MS compared to controls was more pronounced in the posterior corpus callosum. MS participants had a prolonged TCI duration (p = 0.016), which correlated with EDSS (p = 0.020) and disease duration (p = 0.045). In MS, TCI depth correlated negatively with the MWF of the posterior callosal midbody (p = 0.039), a region thought to mediate TCI transmission. In summary, TCI duration was increased in MS and demyelination of the posterior corpus callosum midbody was associated with measurable functional changes. This work demonstrates the potential for combining MRI and TMS with electromyography to draw insights about structure-function relationships in MS pathophysiology. © Copyright © 2019 Zhao, Vavasour, Zakeri, Borich, Laule, Rauscher, Traboulsee, Li, Boyd and MacKay.</p>"

318,2-s2.0-85070544115,Ginkgolide K supports remyelination via induction of astrocytic IGF/PI3K/Nrf2 axis,"<p>Although several therapies are approved, none promote re-myelination in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients, limiting their ability for sustained recovery. Thus, treatment development in MS has the opportunity to tackle the challenges, including experimental therapies targeting neuroprotection and re-myelination. Here, we provide a novel therapeutic target for Ginkgolide K (GK) that is now becoming a very critical natural compound to treat demyelination and neurodegeneration. GK improves behavioral dysfunction and demyelination in cuprizone (CPZ) model, followed by the migration and enrichment of astrocytes in the corpus callosum. Both in vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrates that GK triggers the upregulation of Nrf2/HO-1 in astrocytes and inhibition of p-NF-kB/p65, which is associated with the outcome of anti-inflammation and anti-oxidation by suppressing the production of IL-6 and TNFα as well as nitric oxide and iNOS in astrocytes. Further findings suggest that IGF/PI3K, but not BDNF, was induced in the corpus callosum after GK treatment, revealing that Nrf2 activation inhibited caspase-3 and apoptosis in O4+ oligodendrocytes possibly through IGF/PI3K signaling molecules. Since the current immunomodulatory therapies for MS have failed to prevent patients from entering the progressive phase of the disease, thus targeting Nrf2 in astrocytes with GK would be an ideal strategy for myelin protection and regeneration. © 2019</p>"

In this disease, failure of remyelination could cause persistent disability. Cordycepin, also known as 3′-deoxyadenosine, exerts anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidic, anti-apoptotic and neuroprotective effects. The cuprizone (CPZ) model has been widely used to study MS as it mimics some characteristics of demyelination disease. To determine whether cordycepin promotes remyelination and functional recovery after CPZ-induced demyelination, we administered cordycepin to the CPZ-induced demyelination mice. Cordycepin reversed CPZ-induced loss of body weight and rescued motor dysfunction in the model mice. Cordycepin effectively promoted remyelination and enhanced MBP expression in the corpus callosum. Cordycepin also inhibited the CPZ-induced increase in the number of Iba1-positive microglia, GFAP-positive astrocytes and Olig2-positive oligodendroglial precursor cells in the corpus callosum and cerebral cortex. Pro-inflammatory cytokine expression (IL-1β and IL-6) was inhibited while anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-4 and neurotrophic factor BDNF release was elevated in the corpus callosum and hippocampus after cordycepin treatment. In addition, we also found that cordycepin ameliorated CPZ-induced body weight loss, motor dysfunction, demyelination, glial cells activation and pro-inflammatory cytokine expression in the corpus callosum and hippocampus. Our results suggest that cordycepin may represent a useful therapeutic agent in demyelination-related diseases via suppression of neuroinflammation. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.</p>"
321,2-s2.0-85069677014,[<sup>11</sup>C]PIB PET imaging can detect white and grey matter demyelination in a non-human primate model of progressive multiple sclerosis,"<p>Background: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a demyelinating and inflammatory disease of the central nervous system. Its diagnosis is clinical, often confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging. This image modality, however, is not ideal for discrimination of demyelination in grey and white matter regions from inflammatory lesions. Positron Emission Tomography (PET), using specific radiopharmaceuticals, can be a tool to differentiate between these processes. The radiopharmaceutical [<sup>11</sup>C]PIB is widely used for detection of β-amyloid plaques, but has also been suggested for the analysis of myelin content due to its consistent uptake in white matter. The aim of this study was to evaluate [<sup>11</sup>C]PIB PET imaging as a tool for detecting demyelinated regions in white and grey matter of non-human primate model of progressive MS. Methods: Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) was induced in marmosets by injection of recombinant human myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (rhMOG) emulsified in either Incomplete Freund's Adjuvant (IFA) or Complete Freund's Adjuvant (CFA). [<sup>11</sup>C]PIB PET images were acquired prior to immunization (baseline) and after symptoms were present (end of experiment). Brain tissue was isolated for histochemical analysis. Results: All rhMOG/IFA-treated and rhMOG/CFA-treated animals showed clinical signs of EAE. The rhMOG/CFA group presented a significant [<sup>11</sup>C]PIB uptake reduction only in the left motor cortex (9%, P = 0.011). For the rhMOG/IFA group, significant decrease in [<sup>11</sup>C]PIB uptake was observed in the whole brain (15%, P = 0.015), in the right hemisphere of body of corpus callosum (34%, P = 0.02), splenium of corpus callosum (38%, P = 0.004), hippocampus (19%, P = 0.036), optic tract (13%, P = 0.025), thalamus (14%, P = 0.041), Globus pallidus (23%, P = 0.017), head of caudate nucleus (25%, P = 0.045), tail of caudate nucleus (29%, P = 0.003), putamen (28%, P = 0.047) and left hemisphere of body of corpus callosum (14%, P = 0.037) and head of caudate nucleus (23%, P = 0.023). [<sup>11</sup>C]PIB uptake significantly correlated with luxol fast blue histology (myelin marker), both in the rhMOG/IFA (r<sup>2</sup>= 0.32, P &lt; 0.0001) and the rhMOG/CFA group (r<sup>2</sup>= 0.46, P &lt; 0.0001).

However, the utility of DTI in evaluating therapeutic remyelination has not yet been well-established. Here, we assessed the ability of DTI to distinguish between remyelination and neuroprotection following estrogen receptor β ligand (Indazole chloride, IndCl) treatment, which has been previously shown to stimulate functional remyelination, in the cuprizone (CPZ) diet mouse model of MS. Adult C57BL/6 J male and female mice received a normal diet (control), demyelination-inducing CPZ diet (9wkDM), or CPZ diet followed by two weeks of a normal diet (i.e., remyelination period) with either IndCl (RM + IndCl) or vehicle (RM + Veh) injections. We evaluated tissue microstructure of the corpus callosum utilizing in vivo and ex vivo DTI and immunohistochemistry (IHC) for validation. Compared to control mice, the 9wkDM group showed decreased fractional anisotropy (FA), increased radial diffusivity (RD), and no changes in axial diffusivity (AD) both in vivo and ex vivo. Meanwhile, RM + IndCl groups showed increased FA and decreased RD ex vivo compared to the RM + Veh group, in accordance with the evidence of remyelination by IHC. In conclusion, the DTI technology used in the present study can identify some changes in myelination and is a valuable translational tool for evaluating MS pathophysiology and therapeutic efficacy. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.</p>"

A technique to measure V<sub>ND</sub> for ligands for the 18-kDa translocator protein (TSPO) has recently been developed which compares the total volume of distribution (V<sub>T</sub>) before and after administration of the TSPO ligand XBD173. Here, we used XBD173 with an occupancy plot to quantify V<sub>ND</sub> for two TSPO radiotracers, [<sup>18</sup>F]GE-180 and [<sup>11</sup>C]PBR28, in cohorts of people with multiple sclerosis (MS). Additionally, we compared plots of subjects carrying high (HAB) or mixed binding (MAB) affinity polymorphisms of TSPO to estimate V<sub>ND</sub> without receptor blockade. Procedures: Twelve people with MS underwent baseline MRI and 90-min dynamic [<sup>18</sup>F]GE-180 PET or [<sup>11</sup>C]PBR28 PET (n = 6; three HAB, three MAB each). Arterial blood sampling was used to generate plasma input functions for the two-tissue compartment model. V<sub>ND</sub> was calculated using two independent methods: the occupancy plot (by modelling the differences in signal post XBD173) and the polymorphism plot (by modelling the differences in signal across presence and absence of rs6971 genotypes). Results: Whole brain V<sub>T</sub> (mean ± standard deviation) was 0.29 ± 0.17 ml/cm<sup>3</sup> for [<sup>18</sup>F]GE-180 and 5.01 ± 1.88 ml/cm<sup>3</sup> for [<sup>11</sup>C]PBR28. Using the occupancy and polymorphism plots respectively, V<sub>ND</sub> for [<sup>18</sup>F]GE-180 was 0.11 ml/cm<sup>3</sup> (95 % CI = 0.02, 0.16) and 0.20 ml/cm<sup>3</sup> (0.16, 0.34), accounting for, on average, 55 % of V<sub>T</sub> in the whole brain. For [<sup>11</sup>C]PBR28, these values were 3.81 ml/cm<sup>3</sup> (3.02, 4.21) and 3.49 ml/cm<sup>3</sup> (1.38, 4.27), accounting for 67 % of average whole brain V<sub>T</sub>. Conclusions: Although V<sub>T</sub> for [<sup>18</sup>F]GE-180 is low, indicating low brain penetration, half the signal shown by MS subjects reflected specific TSPO binding. V<sub>T</sub> for [<sup>11</sup>C]PBR28 was higher and two thirds of the binding was non-specific. No brain ROIs were devoid of specific signal, further confirming that true reference tissue approaches are potentially problematic for estimating TSPO levels. © 2019, The Author(s).</p>"
324,2-s2.0-85084718999,Stereological investigation of regional brain volumes after acute and chronic cuprizone-induced demyelination,"<p>Brain volume measurement is one of the most frequently used biomarkers to establish neuroprotective effects during pre-clinical multiple sclerosis (MS) studies. Furthermore, whole-brain atrophy estimates in MS correlate more robustly with clinical disability than traditional, lesion-based metrics. However, the underlying mechanisms leading to brain atrophy are poorly understood, partly due to the lack of appropriate animal models to study this aspect of the disease. The purpose of this study was to assess brain volumes and neuro-axonal degeneration after acute and chronic cuprizone-induced demyelination. C57BL/6 male mice were intoxicated with cuprizone for up to 12 weeks. Brain volume, as well as total numbers and densities of neurons, were determined using design-based stereology. After five weeks of cuprizone intoxication, despite severe demyelination, brain volumes were not altered at this time point. After 12 weeks of cuprizone intoxication, a significant volume reduction was found in the corpus callosum and diverse subcortical areas, particularly the internal capsule and the thalamus. Thalamic volume loss was accompanied by glucose hypermetabolism, analyzed by [<sup>18</sup>F]-fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose (18F-FDG) positron-emission tomography. This study demonstrates region-specific brain atrophy of different subcortical brain regions after chronic cuprizone-induced demyelination. The chronic cuprizone demyelination model in male mice is, thus, a useful tool to study the underlying mechanisms of subcortical brain atrophy and to investigate the effectiveness of therapeutic interventions. © 2019 by the authors.

325,2-s2.0-85083809242,Demyelination-remyelination in the Central Nervous System: Ligand-dependent Participation of the Notch Signaling Pathway,"<p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an immune-mediated central nervous system disease mostly affecting young people. Multiple sclerosis and other neurodegenerative and white matter disorders involve oligodendrocyte (OL) damage and demyelination. Therefore, elucidating the signaling pathways involved in the remyelination process through the maturation of OL progenitor cells (OPCs) may contribute to the development of new therapeutic approaches. In this context, this paper further characterizes toxic cuprizone (CPZ)-induced demyelination and spontaneous remyelination in rats and investigates the role of ligand-dependent Notch signaling activation along demyelination/remyelination both in vivo and in vitro. Toxic treatment generated an inflammatory response characterized by both microgliosis and astrogliosis. Interestingly, early demyelination revealed an increase in the proportion of Jagged1+/GFAP+ cells, which correlated with an increase in Jagged1 transcript and concomitant Jagged1-driven Notch signaling activation, particularly in NG2+ OPCs, in both the corpus callosum (CC) and subventricular zone (SVZ). The onset of remyelination then exhibited an increase in the proportion of F3/contactin+/NG2+ cells, which correlated with an increase in F3/contactin transcript during ongoing remyelination in the CC. Moreover, neurosphere cultures revealed that neural progenitor cells present in the brain SVZ of CPZ-Treated rats recapitulate in vitro the mechanisms underlying the response to toxic injury observed in vivo, compensating for mature OL loss. Altogether, the present results offer strong evidence of cell-Type and ligand-specific Notch signaling activation and its time-and area-dependent participation in toxic demyelination and spontaneous remyelination. © 2019 The Author(s) 2019.

326,2-s2.0-85077527483,Myelin protection by ursolic acid in cuprizone-induced demyelination in mice,"<p>Neuronal survival in multiple sclerosis (MS) and other demyelinating diseases depends on the preservation of myelin and remyelination of axons. Myelin protection is the main purpose to decrease myelin damage in the central nervous system (CNS). Ursolic acid (UA) as a natural product in apple is suggested to protect neural cells. This study is the first to demonstrate an effect for UA on CNS myelin loss induced by cuprizone toxin. In the current study, we hypothesized that daily treatment with UA in drinking water (1 mg/mL) prevents myelin damage by 6 weeks administration of CPZ in mice pellet which lead to corpus callosum axonal demyelination. We assessed the myelin content and the number of myelinating cells in corpus callosum by FluoroMyelin and luxol fast blue staining as well as by immunostaining against MBP and Olig2. Our finding indicated that UA could decrease the extent of demyelination area and enhanced myelin stain intensity within CC and protected oligodendrocyte lineage cells against cuprizone toxin. We could conclude that myelinated structures could be protected by UA in corpus callosum, which provide favorable evidence for the possibility of application of UA in demyelinating diseases and traumatic injuries. © 2019, Iranian Journal of Pharmaceutical Research.

The aim of the present study is comparing the crosstalk between BDNF and TNF<sub>α</sub> in the brain versus serum and their effects on recovery of C57BL/6 mice demyelination in cuprizone model. Methods: Fifteen C57BL/6 mice 6-week-old in three different groups were used: control (standard rodent chow), cuprizone-exposed1 (CPZ1; 0.2% cuprizone feeding for 5 weeks) and cuprizone-exposed2 (CPZ2; 0.2% cuprizone feeding for 5 weeks followed by 2 weeks of cuprizone withdrawal). To prove MS induction and cognitive behavioral impairment, Y-maze test and histological studies with luxol fast blue staining were done. The levels of BDNF and TNF<sub>α</sub> in the brain and serum were measured by ELIZA kits. Results: In the present study, Y-maze test demonstrated that MS significantly impaired the cognitive behavior in both CPZ groups compared to control group. Demyelination in corpus callosum (CC) significantly was higher in the two CPZ groups relative to control group. The brain levels of BDNF significantly decreased while the brain levels of TNF<sub>α</sub> significantly increased in both CPZ groups compared to control group. Serum levels of BDNF and TNF<sub>α</sub> significantly increased in CPZ1 group compared to control group. Conclusion: According to the present results, cuprizone-induced MS caused to an extensive demyelination in CC, which led to impaired cognitive behavior. Moreover, brain and serum levels of BDNF and TNF<sub>α</sub> as well as their crosstalk were affected by cuprizone exposure. © 2019, Iranian Society of Physiology and Pharmacology.

328,2-s2.0-85069644177,Multiple functional therapeutic effects of DL-3-n-butylphthalide in the cuprizone model of demyelination,"<p>Aims: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS). The disease mechanisms driving progressive MS remain unresolved. Without this information, current therapeutic strategies are unsatisfactory in preventing disease progression. Our previous work revealed that DL-3-n-butylphthalide (NBP) treatment reduced demyelination in an ethidium bromide mouse model of demyelination. Here, we examine the effect of NBP in the cuprizone model of demyelination by evaluating the pathologic, functional, and behavioral consequences of treatment with NBP. Materials and methods: Forty mice were divided randomly into 4 groups: a normal diet group, a cuprizone diet group, and two NBP groups (10 and 20 mg/kg). CNS infiltration by microglia, axon health and myelination were assessed using immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy, and the levels of cytoplasmic complexes were assessed by Western blotting. Key findings: The results showed the neuroprotective effects of the NBP included suppressing the microglia activation through inhibition of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) expression, thus decreasing activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway. In particular, myelin density was increased due to an increased mean number of mature oligodendrocytes (OLs) in the high-dose NBP (20 mg/kg) subgroup through reduced oligodendrocyte apoptosis. Meanwhile, increased expression of myelin sheath proteins, including proteolipid protein (PLP) and myelin basic protein (MBP), was observed in the same subgroup. Significance: These data suggest that NBP may not only have anti-inflammatory properties but also promote the survival of OLs in a mouse cuprizone model of demyelination. NBP may have a potential role in the treatment of MS. © 2019</p>"
329,2-s2.0-85068020296,Phenotypic and biochemical analysis of an international cohort of individuals with variants in NAA10 and NAA15,"<p>N-Alpha-Acetylation is one of the most common co-Translational protein modifications in humans and is essential for normal cell function. NAA10 encodes for the enzyme NAA10, which is the catalytic subunit in the N-Terminal acetyltransferase A (NatA) complex. The auxiliary and regulatory subunits of the NatA complex are NAA15 and Huntington-interacting protein (HYPK), respectively. Through a genotype-first approach with exome sequencing, we identified and phenotypically characterized 30 individuals from 30 unrelated families with 17 different de novo or inherited, dominantly acting missense variants in NAA10 or NAA15. Clinical features of affected individuals include variable levels of intellectual disability, delayed speech and motor milestones and autism spectrum disorder. Additionally, some subjects present with mild craniofacial dysmorphology, congenital cardiac anomalies and seizures. One of the individuals is an 11-year-old boy with a frameshift variant in exon 7 of NAA10, who presents most notably with microphthalmia, which confirms a prior finding with a single family with Lenz microphthalmia syndrome. Biochemical analyses of variants as part of the human NatA complex, as well as enzymatic analyses with and without the HYPK regulatory subunit, help to explain some of the phenotypic differences seen among the different variants. © 2019 The Author(s) 2019.

330,2-s2.0-85067452279,BRCA1/BRCA2-containing complex subunit 3 controls oligodendrocyte differentiation by dynamically regulating lysine 63-linked ubiquitination,"<p>Oligodendrocytes (OLs) provide the myelin sheath surrounding axons that propagates action potentials in the central nervous system (CNS). The metabolism of myelinated membranes and proteins is strictly regulated in the OLs and is closely associated with OL differentiation and maturation. The ubiquitination-associated proteasome and endosomal system have not yet been well studied during OL differentiation and maturation. Here, we determined the functions of the Lys63-linked ubiquitination (K63Ub) and K63-specific deubiquitination (DUB) systems regulated by BRCA1/BRCA2-containing complex subunit 3 (BRCC3) during OL differentiation. The competitive inhibition of K63Ub by overexpression of mutant ubiquitin (K63R) in oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) indicated that the two major CNS myelin proteins, myelin basic protein (MBP) and proteolipid protein (PLP), were upregulated in OLs derived from K63R OPCs. In contrast, the knockdown of BRCC3 (BRCC3-KD) through the application of lentivirus-mediated shRNA delivery system into OPCs suppressed OL differentiation by decreasing MBP expression and PLP production. Further immunoprecipitation assays revealed higher levels of sphingolipid GalC, MBP, and PLP, which were associated with K63Ub-immunoprecipitants and detected in endosome/lysosomal compartments, in BRCC3-KD OLs than those in OLs transfected with the scrambled shRNA (scramble OLs). The differentiation of OLs from BRCC3-KD OPCs was impaired in the demyelinating corpus callosum of rats receiving a cuprizone-containing diet. In the demyelinating tissues from human patients suffering from multiple sclerosis, we detected a decreased number of BRCC3-expressing OLs at the lesion site, accompanied by a greater number of OLs expressing EEA1 and K63Ub at high levels. Altogether, the counterbalance of the K63Ub machinery and BRCC3-triggered DUB machinery are important for the cellular trafficking of myelin proteins and OL differentiation. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p>"
331,2-s2.0-85067198723,The effects of a combination of ion channel inhibitors on pathology in a model of demyelinating disease,"<p>Background: Multiple sclerosis (MS) has been shown to feature oxidative damage, which can be modelled using the cuprizone model of demyelinating disease. Oxidative damage can occur as a result of excessive influx of calcium ions (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) and oligodendroglia are particularly vulnerable. However, the effects of limiting excess Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx on oxidative damage, oligodendroglia and myelin structure are unknown. Objective: This study investigated the effects of limiting excess Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux on oxidative damage and associated changes in oligodendroglial densities and Node of Ranvier structure in the cuprizone model. Methods: The effects of three weeks of cuprizone administration and of treatment with a combination of three ion channel inhibitors (Lomerizine, Brilliant Blue G (BBG) and YM872), were semi-quantified immunohistochemically. Outcomes assessed were protein nitration (3-nitrotyrosine (3NT)) oxidative damage to DNA (8-hydroxy deoxyguanosine (8OHDG)), advanced glycation end-products (carboxymethyl lysine (CML)), immunoreactivity of microglia (Iba1) and astrocytes (glial acidic fibrillary protein (GFAP)), densities of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) (platelet derived growth factor alpha receptor (PDGFαR) with olig2) and oligodendrocytes (olig2 and CC1), and structural elements of the Node of Ranvier (contactin associated protein (Caspr)). Results: The administration of cuprizone resulted in increased protein nitration, DNA damage, and astrocyte and microglial immunoreactivity, a decrease in the density of oligodendrocytes and OPCs, together with altered structure of the Node of Ranvier and reduced myelin basic protein immunoreactivity. Treatment with the ion channel inhibitor combination significantly lowered protein nitration, increased the density of OPCs and reduced the number of atypical Node of Ranvier complexes; other outcomes were unaffected. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that excess Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx contributes to protein nitration, and associated changes to OPC densities and Node of Ranvier structure in demyelinating disease. © 2019</p>"
332,2-s2.0-85065927122,Voluntary running wheel attenuates motor deterioration and brain damage in cuprizone-induced demyelination,"<p>Growing data from human and animal studies indicate the beneficial effects of exercise on several clinical outcomes in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS), an autoimmune, demyelinating disease, suggesting that it may slow down the disease progression, by reducing brain damage. However, the mechanisms involved are still elusive. Aim of this study was to address the effects of voluntary running wheel in a toxic-demyelinating model of MS, in which demyelination and brain inflammation occur in response to cuprizone (CPZ) treatment. Mice were housed in standard or wheel-equipped cages starting from the day of CPZ or normal chow feeding for three or six weeks and evaluated for weight changes, locomotor skills and neuromuscular functions over the course of the experimental design. Biochemical, molecular biology and immunohistochemical analyses were performed. Exercise prevented early weight loss caused by CPZ, indicating improved wellness in these mice. Both neuromuscular function and motor coordination were significantly enhanced by exercise in CPZ-treated mice. Moreover, exercise induced an early protection against axonal damage and the loss of the myelin associated proteins, myelin basic protein (MBP) and 2′,3′-Cyclic-nucleotide 3′-phosphodiesterase (CNPase), in the striatum and the corpus callosum, in coincidence of a strongly attenuated microglia activation in both brain areas. Further, during the late phase of the treatment, exercise in CPZ mice reduced the recruitment of new OLs compared to sedentary CPZ mice, likely due to the precocious protection against myelin damage. Overall, these results suggest that life-style interventions can be effective against the demyelinating-inflammatory processes occurring in the brains of MS patients. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.</p>"

334,2-s2.0-85067311903,Mesenchymal stem cell mediated effects on microglial phenotype in cuprizone-induced demyelination model,"<p>Microglial cells have an essential role in neurodegenerative disorders, such as multiple sclerosis. They are divided into two subgroups: M1 and M2 phenotypes. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC), with neuroprotective and immunomodulating properties, could improve these diseases. We evaluate the immunomodulating effects of MSC on microglial phenotypes and the improvement of demyelination in a cuprizone (CPZ) model of multiple sclerosis (MS). For inducing the chronic demyelination model, C57BL6 mice were given a diet with 0.2% CPZ (w/w) for 12 weeks. In the MSC group, cells were transplanted into the right lateral ventricle of mice. The expression of targeted genes was assessed by real-time polymerase chain reaction. M1 and M2 microglial phenotypes were assessed by immunohistochemistry of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and Arg-1, respectively. Remyelination was studied by luxal fast blue (LFB) staining and electron microscopy (EM). We found that MSC transplantation reduced the expression level of M1-specific messenger RNA (mRNA; iNOS and CD86) but increased the expression level of M2 specific genes (CD206, Arg-1, and CX3CR1) in comparison to the CPZ group. Moreover, cell therapy significantly decreased the M1 marker (iNOS<sup>+</sup> cells), but M2 marker (Arg-1<sup>+</sup> cells) significantly increased in comparison with the CPZ group. In addition, MSC treatment significantly increased the CX3CL1 expression level in comparison with the CPZ group and led to improvement in remyelination, which was confirmed by LFB and EM images. The results showed that MSC transplantation increases the M2 and decreases the M1 phenotype in MS. This change was accompanied by decrease in demyelination and axonal injury and indicated that MSCs have a positive effect on MS by modification of microglia cells. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p>"
335,2-s2.0-85063996481,Magnetic resonance elastography of brain: Comparison between anisotropic and isotropic stiffness and its correlation to age,"<p>Purpose: Noninvasive measurement of mechanical properties of brain tissue using magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) has been a promising method for investigating neurologic disorders such as multiple sclerosis, hydrocephalus, and Alzheimer’s. However, because of the regional and directional dependency of brain stiffness, estimating anisotropic stiffness is important. This study investigates isotropic and anisotropic stiffness as a function of age as well as the correlation between isotropic and anisotropic stiffness. Methods: MRE and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) were performed on 28 healthy subjects with age ranges between 18–62 y. Isotropic and anisotropic stiffness was measured and compared with age for different regions of interest such as the thalamus, corpus callosum, gray matter, white matter, and whole brain. Results: Isotropic stiffness in gray matter (r<sub>s</sub>= −0.57; P = 0.001) showed a significant decrease with age. Anisotropic stiffness in gray matter showed a significant decrease with age in C<sub>11</sub> through C<sub>66</sub> and in the thalamus, only in C<sub>33</sub>. Between anisotropic and isotropic stiffness, gray matter showed a significant positive correlation in C<sub>11</sub>through C<sub>66</sub>, C<sub>22</sub> and C<sub>66</sub> showed a significant negative correlation in the thalamus and whole brain, and C<sub>44</sub> showed a negative correlation in the corpus callosum. No significant difference between genders was observed in any measurements. Conclusion: This study demonstrated a change in isotropic and anisotropic stiffness with age in different regions of the brain along with a correlation of anisotropic stiffness to isotropic stiffness. © 2019 International Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine</p>"

337,2-s2.0-85063392461,Axonal water fraction as marker of white matter injury in primary-progressive multiple sclerosis: a longitudinal study,"<p>Background and purpose: Diffuse white matter (WM) injury is prominent in primary-progressive multiple sclerosis (PP-MS) pathology and is a potential biomarker of disease progression. Diffusion kurtosis imaging allows the quantification of non-Gaussian water diffusion, providing metrics with high WM pathological specificity. The aim of this study was to characterize the pathological changes occurring in the normal-appearing WM of patients with PP-MS at baseline and at 1-year follow-up and to assess their impact on disability and short-term disease progression. Methods: A total of 26 patients with PP-MS and 20 healthy controls were prospectively enrolled. Diffusion kurtosis imaging single-shot echo-planar imaging (EPI) was acquired on a 3-T scanner (Philips Achieva, Best, The Netherlands) (voxel size, 2 × 2 × 2 mm<sup>3</sup>, 30 directions for each b-value = 1000, 2000 s/mm<sup>2</sup> and one b = 0 s/mm<sup>2</sup>). A two-compartment biophysical model of WM tract integrity was used to derive spatial maps of axonal water fraction (AWF), intra-axonal diffusivity, extra-axonal axial and radial diffusivities (D<sub>e,axial</sub>, D<sub>e,radial</sub>) and tortuosity from the following WM tracts: corpus callosum (CC), corticospinal tract (CST) and posterior thalamic radiation (PTR). Results: At baseline, patients with PP-MS showed a widespread decrease of AWF, tortuosity and D<sub>e,axial</sub> and an increase of D<sub>e,radial</sub> in CC, CST and PTR (P ranging from 0.001 to 0.036). At 1-year follow-up, a significant AWF decrease was detected in the body of CC (P = 0.048), PTR (P = 0.008) and CST (P = 0.044). Baseline AWF values in CST significantly discriminated progressed from non-progressed patients (P = 0.021; area under the curve, 0.854). Conclusion: Based on its change over time and its relationship with disease progression, among the analyzed metrics, AWF seems the most sensitive metric of WM tissue damage in PP-MS and therefore it could be considered as a marker for monitoring disease progression. © 2019 EAN</p>"

339,2-s2.0-85069941474,Systemic TLR2 tolerance enhances central nervous system remyelination,"<p>Background: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a central nervous system (CNS) autoimmune disease characterized by both inflammatory demyelination and impaired remyelination. Studies indicate that Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) signaling contributes to both the inflammatory component and the defective remyelination in MS. While most MS therapeutics target adaptive immunity, we recently reported that reducing TLR2 signaling in innate immune cells by inducing TLR2 tolerance attenuates adoptively transferred experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Given that previous reports suggest TLR2 signaling also inhibits myelin repair, the objective of this study was to assess how reducing TLR2 signaling through TLR2 tolerance induction affects CNS myelin repair. Methods: Chow containing 0.2% cuprizone was fed to male and female wild-type (WT) C57BL/6 mice or TLR2-deficient (TLR2<sup>-/-</sup>) mice for 5 weeks to induce demyelination. During a 2-week remyelination period following discontinuation of cuprizone, WT mice received either low dose TLR2 ligands to induce systemic TLR2 tolerance or vehicle control (VC). Remyelination was evaluated via electron microscopy and immunohistochemical analysis of microglia and oligodendrocytes in the corpus callosum. Statistical tests included 2-way ANOVA and Mann-Whitney U analyses. Results: Inducing TLR2 tolerance in WT mice during remyelination significantly enhanced myelin recovery, restoring unmyelinated axon frequency and myelin thickness to baseline levels compared to VC-treated mice. Mechanistically, enhanced remyelination in TLR2 tolerized mice was associated with a shift in corpus callosum microglia from a pro-inflammatory iNOS<sup>+</sup> phenotype to a non-inflammatory/pro-repair Arg1<sup>+</sup> phenotype. This result was confirmed in vitro by inducing TLR2 tolerance in WT microglia cultures. TLR2<sup>-/-</sup> mice, without TLR2 tolerance induction, also significantly enhanced myelin recovery compared to WT mice, adding confirmation that reduced TLR2 signaling is associated with enhanced remyelination. Discussion: Our results suggest that reducing TLR2 signaling in vivo by inducing TLR2 tolerance significantly enhances myelin repair. Furthermore, the enhanced remyelination resulting from TLR2 tolerance induction is associated with a shift in corpus callosum microglia from a pro-inflammatory iNOS<sup>+</sup> phenotype to a non-inflammatory/pro-repair Arg1<sup>+</sup> phenotype. While deletion of TLR2 would be an impractical approach in vivo, reducing innate immune signaling through TLR2 tolerance induction may represent a novel, two-pronged approach for treating both inflammatory and myelin repair components of MS. © 2019 The Author(s).</p>"
340,2-s2.0-85069621329,Neural stem cells of the subventricular zone contribute to neuroprotection of the corpus callosum after cuprizone-induced demyelination,"<p>Myelin loss occurring in demyelinating diseases, including multiple sclerosis, is the leading cause of long-lasting neurological disability in adults. While endogenous remyelination, driven by resident oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs), might partially compensate myelin loss in the early phases of demyelinating disorders, this spontaneous reparative potential fails at later stages. To investigate the cellular mechanisms sustaining endogenous remyelination in demyelinating disorders, we focused our attention on endogenous neural precursor cells (eNPCs) located within the subventricular zone (SVZ) since this latter area is considered one of the primary sources of new OPCs in the adult forebrain. First, we fate mapped SVZ-eNPCs in cuprizone-induced demyelination and found that SVZ endogenous neural stem/precursor cells are recruited during the remyelination phase to the corpus callosum (CC) and are capable of forming new oligodendrocytes. When we ablated SVZ-derived eNPCs during cuprizone-induced demyelination in female mice, the animals displayed reduced numbers of oligodendrocytes within the lesioned CC. Although this reduction in oligodendrocytes did not impact the ensuing remyelination, eNPC-ablated mice experienced increased axonal loss. Our results indicate that, in toxic models of demyelination, SVZderived eNPCs contribute to support axonal survival. © 2019 the authors.</p>"

Objective: We aimed to examine early brain volumetric and microstructural changes and retinal nerve fibre layer thinning as predictors of longer term MS severity in patients with clinically isolated syndromes (CIS). Methods: Lesion metrics, brain and regional atrophy, diffusion fractional anisotropy and retinal nerve fibre layer thickness were prospectively assessed in 36 patients with CIS over the first 12 months after presentation and compared with clinical outcomes at longer term follow-up [median (IQR) = 8.5 (7.8–8.9) years]. Results: In total, 25 (69%) patients converted to MS and had greater baseline lesion volume (p = 0.008) and number (p = 0.03)than CIS patients. Over the initial 12 months, new lesions (p = 0.0001), retinal nerve fibre layer thinning (p = 0.04) and ventricular enlargement (p = 0.03) were greater in MS than CIS patients. In MS patients, final Expanded Disability Status Scale score correlated with retinal nerve fibre layer thinning over the first 12 months (ρ = −0.67, p = 0.001). Conclusions: Additional to lesion metrics, early measurements of fractional anisotropy and retinal nerve fibre layer thinning are informative about longer term clinical outcomes in CIS. © The Author(s) 2019.</p>"

343,2-s2.0-85070560791,Imaging mass spectrometry: A new tool to assess molecular underpinnings of neurodegeneration,"<p>Neurodegenerative diseases are prevalent and devastating. While extensive research has been done over the past decades, we are still far from comprehensively understanding what causes neurodegeneration and how we can prevent it or reverse it. Recently, systems biology approaches have led to a holistic examination of the interactions between genome, metabolome, and the environment, in order to shed new light on neurodegenerative pathogenesis. One of the new technologies that has emerged to facilitate such studies is imaging mass spectrometry (IMS). With its ability to map a wide range of small molecules with high spatial resolution, coupled with the ability to quantify them at once, without the need for a priori labeling, IMS has taken center stage in current research efforts in elucidating the role of the metabolome in driving neurodegeneration. IMS has already proven to be effective in investigating the lipidome and the proteome of various neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, Huntington’s, multiple sclerosis, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Here, we review the IMS platform for capturing biological snapshots of the metabolic state to shed more light on the molecular mechanisms of the diseased brain. © 2019 by the authors.

Methods: Chinese patients diagnosed with MS (n = 33), NMOSD (n = 31), and ADEM (n = 18) were enrolled. Characteristics of lesions in corpus callosum were evaluated with 1.5 Tesla MRI scanners. Chi-squared test (Fisher's exact test) was used to analyze the data. Results: In corpus callosum, NMOSD and ADEM lesions tend to have a diffuse distribution (p = 0.006, p = 0.033) and blurred margins (p &lt; 0.001, p = 0.017), when compared with MS; lesions in NMOSD were less ovoid (p = 0.006), while fewer lesions in ADEM existed in the rostrum and genu (p = 0.002). NMOSD has the most heterogeneous intensity on post-enhancement sequences (p = 0.016, p = 0.001). Radial-like lesions were more common in MS and NMOSD (p = 0.019, p &lt; 0.001). Conclusion: MS lesions were most likely focally-localized with clear margins. Radial callosal lesions are characteristic of MS and NMOSD but rarely seen in ADEM. The signal intensities of the lesion were the most heterogeneous in NMOSD. Therefore, the lesion patterns in corpus callosum may serve as a useful clue for correct diagnosis, facilitating early treatment. © 2019</p>"

According to new findings of the effects of metformin on mitochondrial function, has attracted a lot of attention. Furthermore, it is suggested that metformin exerts its beneficial influence through AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway. In the current study, we investigated the possible protective effects of metformin on oxidative stress and mitochondrial function by activating the AMPK pathway in the cuprizone-induced demyelination. Mice were fed with cuprizone for 6 weeks. Animals simultaneously received metformin. After sacrificing animals, myelinations, and gliosis, changes in transcription factor and biochemical analysis were assessed. Transmission electron microscopy and luxol fast blue staining revealed that the myelinated axons within corpus callosum of cuprizone-induced demyelination animals increased after administration of metformin. Metformin also upregulated the expression of mitochondrial biogenesis genes. Furthermore, the biochemical analysis demonstrated that metformin ameliorated the oxidative stress induced by cuprizone. Immunohistochemistry analysis showed that astrogliosis and microgliosis were decreased after metformin administration while it enhanced the number of oligodendrocytes. Our data implicated that metformin exerts its therapeutic effects on MS by AMPK signaling improved mitochondrial homeostasis and protected oligodendrocytes. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.</p>"
350,2-s2.0-85064682609,Effect of mesenchymal stem cells on glial cells population in cuprizone induced demyelination model,"<p>Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs)have a notable potential to modulate immune responses and protect the central nervous system (CNS), mostly by secreting factors that affect inflammation. MSCs have the ability to improve several autoimmune diseases in animal models including multiple sclerosis (MS). MS is a disease of the CNS among adult humans and it is characterized by demyelination, neuroinflammation and gliosis. In this study, we first induced chronic demyelination by cuprizone, followed by intraventricular injection of MSC. Our results showed that MSC significantly decreased microgliosis and astrocytosis by secreting cytokines that have neuroprotective activity including TGF-β and CX3CL1. Also, downregulation of IL-1β and TNF-α as inflammatory chemokines was seen along with decreased astrocytes and microglia activation. Finally, these results showed that trophic factors secreted by MSC can increase oligodendrocyte population and remyelination rate by reducing pro-inflammatory factors. These findings demonstrate that MSC could decrease inflammation, gliosis and demyelination with neuroprotective and immunomodulating properties in chronic cuprizone demyelination model. Therefore MSC transplantation can be considered as a suitable approach for enhancing myelination and reducing inflammation in diseases such as MS. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd</p>"
351,2-s2.0-85064498795,Therapeutic effect of oligomeric proanthocyanidin in cuprizone-induced demyelination,"<p>New Findings: What is the central question of this study? Oligomeric proanthocyanidin has the capacity to alleviate abnormalities in neurological functioning. However, whether oligomeric proanthocyanidin can reduce the progression of demyelination or promote remyelination in demyelinating diseases remains unknown. What is the main finding and its importance? Oligomeric proanthocyanidin can improve cuprizone-induced demyelination by inhibiting immune cell infiltration, reversing overactivated microglia, decreasing the inflammatory cytokines secreted by inflammatory cells and decreasing the production of myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein<sub>35–55</sub>-specific antibody in the brain. Abstract: Demyelinating diseases of the CNS, including multiple sclerosis, neuromyelitis optica and acute disseminated encephalomylitis, are characterized by recurrent primary demyelination–remyelination and progressive neurodegeneration. In the present study, we investigated the therapeutic effect of oligomeric proanthocyanidin (OPC), the most effective component of grape seed extract, in cuprizone-fed C57BL/6 mice, a classic demyelination–remyelination model. Our results showed that OPC attenuated abnormal behaviour, reduced demyelination and increased expression of myelin basic protein and expression of O4<sup>+</sup> oligodendrocytes in the corpus callosum. Oligomeric proanthocyanidin also reduced the numbers of B and T cells, activated microglia in the corpus callosum and inhibited secretion of inflammatory factors. Furthermore, concentrations of myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein-specific antibodies were significantly reduced in serum and brain homogenates after OPC treatment. Together, these results demonstrate a potent therapeutic effect for OPC in cuprizone-mediated demyelination and clearly highlight multiple effects of this natural product in attenuating myelin-specific autoantibodies and the inflammatory microenvironment in the brain. © 2019 The Authors.

352,2-s2.0-85063635809,Pathological changes in mice with long term cuprizone administration,"<p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS). In MS, a long disease duration is known to be a strong risk factor for converting the clinical course of the disease from relapse remitting MS to secondary progressing MS. There is a hypothesis that long sustained demyelination may exhaust neurons, however, pathological changes induced in neurons following demyelination remain unknown. Cuprizone administration can induce and sustain demyelination in the mouse CNS. We examined pathological changes in mice following long sustained demyelination caused by up to 34-week cuprizone administration. Twelve-week cuprizone administration induced severe demyelination in the cerebral cortex, corpus callosum and deep cerebellar nuclei. Demyelination persisted up to 34 weeks, as shown by myelin basic protein immunohistochemistry. In contrast, cuprizone administration developed demyelination in the striatum by week 34. In these demyelinated regions, no neuronal loss was observed. However, in the striatum and deep cerebellar nuclei, cuprizone-induced demyelination changed the intracellular distribution of parvalbumin (PV). Furthermore, in the striatum, there was an increase in PV in the demyelinated axons and most PV immunoreactivity did not co-localize with SMI32 immunoreactivity in mice with 34-week cuprizone administration. Further, mice with 34-week cuprizone administration showed motor coordination dysfunction in the balance beam test. However, 12-week withdrawal from the cuprizone diet induced remyelination in the regions and motor coordination dysfunction recovered. These results indicate that 34-week cuprizone administration induces and sustains demyelination and results in reversible motor coordination dysfunction. The change of intracellular PV distribution suggests that PV may protect demyelinated axons by Ca <sup>2+</sup> buffering. This model may be useful to investigate pathological and behavioral changes following demyelination in the CNS. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd</p>"
353,2-s2.0-85062955847,Discriminative clinical and neuroimaging features of motor-predominant hereditary diffuse leukoencephalopathy with axonal spheroids and primary progressive multiple sclerosis: A preliminary cross-sectional study,"<p>Background: Hereditary diffuse leukoencephalopathy with axonal spheroids (HDLS) is a rare autosomal-dominant white matter disease, typically characterized by juvenile cognitive decline and frontoparietal white matter lesions. A portion of HDLS patients exhibit preferential motor dysfunctions as their initial symptoms, mimicking multiple sclerosis (MS). However, there is no study comparing this phenotype of HDLS and primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS), which greatly resemble each other. This is the first preliminary study to clarify the clinical and neuroimaging features of motor-predominant HDLS, and compare it with PPMS, using cases whose colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) were sequenced. Methods: Clinical and radiological data from Japanese patients at the Department of Neurology, Kyushu University Hospital, Fukuoka, Japan, were evaluated retrospectively and cross-sectionally. Twenty-nine brain and 18 spinal cord magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans from four motor-predominant HDLS patients with CSF1R mutations and 15 PPMS patients without CSF1R mutations, were evaluated using an HDLS MRI scoring system. Results: Two patients with HDLS were initially diagnosed with MS and received immunotherapy. Clinically, motor-predominant HDLS and PPMS patients resembled each other in onset age and disability. However, motor-predominant HDLS patients had a significantly higher frequency of frontal release signs, lower positivity rates of oligoclonal IgG bands (OCB), and lower IgG index values. Total HDLS MRI scores, total white matter lesions (WMLs), and brain atrophy were similar between the diseases. However, motor-predominant HDLS patients had more marked atrophy of the corpus callosum (CC) body, more WMLs in the deep and subcortical regions of the frontoparietal lobes, fewer WMLs in the occipitotemporal periventricular regions, and more restricted diffusivity lesions on MRI than PPMS patients. There was a stronger association between disease duration and CC index in HDLS, suggesting more rapid progression compared with PPMS. Conclusions: Motor-predominant HDLS has characteristic frequent frontal release signs, normal findings for OCB and the IgG index, severe CC body atrophy, abundant deep and subcortical WMLs in the frontoparietal lobes, subtle occipitotemporal lobe periventricular WMLs, and more restricted diffusivity lesions on MRI. Although the present study was limited by the small number of HDLS cases, we propose that immunotherapy should be avoided in such cases. © 2019</p>"
354,2-s2.0-85059848319,Effect of the CSF1R inhibitor PLX3397 on remyelination of corpus callosum in a cuprizone-induced demyelination mouse model,"<p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory disease affecting the central nervous system (CNS). Despite introducing multiple immunomodulatory approaches for MS, there are still major concerns about possible ways for improving remyelination in this disease. Microglia exert essential roles in regulation of myelination processes, and interaction between colony-stimulating factor 1 (CSF1) with its receptor CSF1R is considered as a key regulator of microglial differentiation and survival. The aim of this study was to investigate possible roles for a CSF1R inhibitor PLX3397 in recovery of central myelination processes. Chronic demyelination was induced in mice by addition of 0.2% cuprizone to the chow for 12 weeks. Next, animals were undergoing a diet containing 290 mg/kg PLX3397 to induce microglial ablation. The PLX3397 treatment caused a significant decrease in the rate of expression for the CSF1/CSF1R axis, and a reduction in the protein expressions for the microglial marker Iba-1 and for the oligodendrocyte marker Olig-2. Findings from Luxol fast blue (LFB) staining and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) showed an increase in the rate of myelination for the mice receiving PLX3397. The rate of destruction in the nerve fibers and the extent of the gaps formed between layers of myelin sheaths was also reduced after the treatment with PLX3397. In addition, animals experienced an improvement in recovery of motor deficit after receiving PLX3397 (for all P &lt; 0.05). It could be concluded that PLX3397 could retain myelination in the MS model possibly through regulation of the myelin environment. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p>"
355,2-s2.0-85053813941,Visualization of the Breakdown of the Axonal Transport Machinery: a Comparative Ultrastructural and Immunohistochemical Approach,"<p>Axonal damage is a major factor contributing to disease progression in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. On the histological level, acute axonal injury is most frequently analyzed by anti-amyloid precursor protein immunohistochemistry. To what extent this method truly detects axonal injury, and whether other proteins and organelles are as well subjected to axonal transport deficits in demyelinated tissues is not known. The aim of this study was to correlate ultrastructural morphology with the immunohistochemical appearance of acute axonal injury in a model of toxin-induced oligodendrocyte degeneration. C57BL/6J mice were intoxicated with 0.25% cuprizone to induce demyelination. The corpus callosum was investigated by serial block-face scanning electron microscopy (i.e., 3D EM), immunohistochemistry, and immunofluorescence microscopy. Brain tissues of progressive MS patients were included to test the relevance of our findings in mice for MS. Volumes of axonal swellings, determined by 3D EM, were comparable to volumes of axonal spheroids, determined by anti-APP immunofluorescence stains. Axonal swellings were present at myelinated and non-myelinated axonal internodes. Densities of amyloid precursor protein (APP) <sup>+</sup> spheroids were highest during active demyelination. Besides APP, vesicular glutamate transporter 1 and mitochondrial proteins accumulated at sites of axonal spheroids. Such accumulations were found as well in lesions of progressive MS patients. In this correlative ultrastructural-immunohistochemical study, we provide strong evidence that breakdown of the axonal transport machinery results in focal accumulations of mitochondria and different synaptic proteins. We provide new marker proteins to visualize acute axonal injury, which helps to further understand the complex nature of axonal damage in progressive MS. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.</p>"
356,2-s2.0-85062468740,Functional Effects of Cuprizone-Induced Demyelination in the Presence of the mTOR-Inhibitor Rapamycin,"<p>Persistent demyelination has been implicated in axon damage and functional deficits underlying neurodegenerative diseases such as multiple sclerosis. The cuprizone diet model of demyelination allows for the investigation of mechanisms underlying timed and reproducible demyelination and remyelination. However, spontaneous oligodendrocyte (OL)progenitor (OPC)proliferation, OPC differentiation, and axon remyelination during cuprizone diet may convolute the understanding of remyelinating events. The Akt (a serine/threonine kinase)/mTOR (the mammalian target of rapamycin)signaling pathway in OLs regulates intermediate steps during myelination. Thus, in an effort to inhibit spontaneous remyelination, the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin has been administered during cuprizone diet. Intrigued by the potential for rapamycin to optimize the cuprizone model by producing more complete demyelination, we sought to characterize the effects of rapamycin on axonal function and myelination. Functional remyelination was assessed by callosal compound action potential (CAP)recordings along with immunohistochemistry in mice treated with rapamycin during cuprizone diet. Rapamycin groups exhibited similar myelination, but significantly increased axonal damage and inflammation compared to non-rapamycin groups. There was minimal change in CAP amplitude between groups, however, a significant decrease in conduction velocity of the slower, non-myelinated CAP component was observed in the rapamycin group relative to the non-rapamycin group. During remyelination, rapamycin groups showed a significant decrease in OPC proliferation and mature OLs, suggesting a delay in OPC differentiation kinetics. In conclusion, we question the use of rapamycin to produce consistent demyelination as rapamycin increased inflammation and axonal damage, without affecting myelination. © 2019 IBRO</p>"
357,2-s2.0-85065720812,Gene expression in oligodendrocytes during remyelination reveals cholesterol homeostasis as a therapeutic target in multiple sclerosis,"<p>Regional differences in neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and microglia exist in the brain during health, and regional differences in the transcriptome may occur for each cell type during neurodegeneration. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is multifocal, and regional differences in the astrocyte transcriptome occur in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an MS model. MS and EAE are characterized by inflammation, demyelination, and axonal damage, with minimal remyelination. Here, RNA-sequencing analysis of MS tissues from six brain regions suggested a focus on oligodendrocyte lineage cells (OLCs) in corpus callosum. Olig1-RiboTag mice were used to determine the translatome of OLCs in vivo in corpus callosum during the remyelination phase of a chronic cuprizone model with axonal damage. Cholesterol-synthesis gene pathways dominated as the top up-regulated pathways in OLCs during remyelination. In EAE, remyelination was induced with estrogen receptor-β (ERβ) ligand treatment, and up-regulation of cholesterol-synthesis gene expression was again observed in OLCs. ERβ-ligand treatment in the cuprizone model further increased cholesterol synthesis gene expression and enhanced remyelination. Conditional KOs of ERβ in OLCs demonstrated that increased cholesterol-synthesis gene expression in OLCs was mediated by direct effects in both models. To address this direct effect, ChIP assays showed binding of ERβ to the putative estrogen-response element of a key cholesterol-synthesis gene (Fdps). As fetal OLCs are exposed in utero to high levels of estrogens in maternal blood, we discuss how remyelinating properties of estrogen treatment in adults during injury may recapitulate normal developmental myelination through targeting cholesterol homeostasis in OLCs. © 2019 National Academy of Sciences.

We aim to investigate the longitudinal neurometabolite profile of white matter in MS fatigue. Forty-eight relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) patients with an expanded disability status scale (EDSS) ≤ 4 underwent high field 1H-multivoxel magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) at baseline and year 1. Fatigue severity was evaluated by the fatigue severity scale (FSS). Patients were divided into low (LF, FSS ≤ 3), moderate (MF, FSS = 3.1–5), and high fatigue (HF, FSS ≥ 5.1) groups. In a two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), we observed a decline in the ratio of the sum of N-acetylaspartate (NAA) and N-acetylaspartylglutamate (NAAG) to the sum of creatine (Cr) and phosphocreatine (PCr) in the right anterior quadrant (RAQ) and left anterior quadrant (LAQ) of the MRS grid in the HF group at baseline and year 1. This decline was significant when compared with the LF group (p = 0.018 and 0.020). In a one-way ANOVA, the fatigue group effect was significant and the ratio difference in the right posterior quadrant (RPQ) and left posterior quadrant (LPQ) of the HF group was also significant (p = 0.012 and 0.04). Neurochemical changes in the bilateral frontal white matter and possibly parietooccipital areas were noted in the HF group at two different time points.

We found that Transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1, which is present in higher levels in the systemic environment, promotes oligodendrocyte maturation. Oligodendrocyte maturation was enhanced by adult mouse serum treatment via TGF-β type I receptor. Decrease in circulating TGF-β1 level prevented remyelination in the spinal cord after toxin-induced demyelination. TGF-β1 administration promoted remyelination and restored neurological function in a multiple sclerosis animal model. Furthermore, TGF-β1 treatment stimulated human oligodendrocyte maturation. These data provide the therapeutic possibility of TGF-β for demyelinating diseases. © Hamaguchi et al.</p>"
361,2-s2.0-85065786086,Relationship of iron metabolism and short-term cuprizone treatment of c57bl/6 mice,"<p>One of the models to investigate the distinct mechanisms contributing to neurodegeneration in multiple sclerosis is based on cuprizone (CZ) intoxication. CZ is toxic to mature oligodendrocytes and produces demyelination within the central nervous system but does not cause direct neuronal damage. The CZ model is suitable for better understanding the molecular mechanism of de- and remyelination processes of oligodendrocytes. CZ is a copper chelating agent and it also affects the iron metabolism in brain and liver tissues. To determine the early effect of CZ treatment on iron homeostasis regulation, cytosolic and mitochondrial iron storage, as well as some lipid metabolism genes, we investigated the expression of respective iron homeostasis and lipid metabolism genes of the corpus callosum (CC) and the liver after short-term CZ administration. In the present study C57BL/6 male mice aged four weeks were fed with standard rodent food premixed with 0.2 w/w% CZ for two or eight days. The major findings of our experiments are that short-term CZ treatment causes significant changes in iron metabolism regulation as well as in the expression of myelin and lipid synthesis-related genes, even before apparent demyelination occurs. Both in the CC and the liver the iron uptake, utilization and storage are modified, though not always the same way or to the same extent in the two organs. Understanding the role of iron in short-term and long-term CZ intoxication could provide a partial explanation of the discrepant signs of acute and chronic MS. These could contribute to understanding the development of multiple sclerosis and might provide a possible drug target. © 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.</p>"

The imaging protocol included T2∗-weighted (w) imaging and an MP2RAGE sequence yielding 3D T1w images and quantitative T1 maps. We semiautomatically marked the lesion-free periependymal area around the cerebral aqueduct and the lateral, third, and fourth ventricles to finally measure and compare the T1 relaxation time within these areas.ResultsWe did not observe any differences in the T1 relaxation time between patients with NMOSD and HCs (all p &gt; 0.05). Contrarily, the T1 relaxation time was longer in patients with MS vs patients with NMOSD (lateral ventricle p = 0.056, third ventricle p = 0.173, fourth ventricle p = 0.016, and cerebral aqueduct p = 0.048) and vs HCs (third ventricle p = 0.027, fourth ventricle p = 0.013, lateral ventricle p = 0.043, and cerebral aqueduct p = 0.005).ConclusionUnlike in MS, we did not observe subtle T1 changes in lesion-free periependymal regions in NMOSD, which supports the hypothesis of a rather focal than diffuse brain pathology in NMOSD. © 2019 American Academy of Neurology.</p>"

Methods: Thirty people with MS (23 relapsing-remitting MS [RRMS], 7 progressive MS [PMS]) and 23 healthy controls were scanned on a human 3-tesla (3T) MRI scanner equipped with 300 mT/m maximum gradient strength using a comprehensive multishell diffusion MRI protocol. Data were fitted to a three-compartment geometric model of white matter to estimate apparent axon diameter and axon density in the midline corpus callosum. Neurologic disability and cognitive function were measured using the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite (MSFC), and Minimal Assessment of Cognitive Function in MS battery. Results: Apparent axon diameter was significantly larger and axon density reduced in the normal-appearing corpus callosum (NACC) of MS patients compared to healthy controls, with similar trends seen in PMS compared to RRMS. Larger apparent axon diameter in the NACC of MS patients correlated with greater disability as measured by the EDSS (r = 0.555, P = 0.007) and poorer performance on the Symbol Digits Modalities Test (r = -0.593, P = 0.008) and Brief Visuospatial Memory Test–Revised (r = −0.632, P &lt; 0.01), tests of interhemispheric processing speed and new learning and memory, respectively.

Karst. This study aimed to investigate effects of polyprenols on oligodendrogenesis, neurogenesis, and myelin content in the cuprizone demyelination model. Demyelination was induced by 0.5% cuprizone in CD-1 mice during 10 weeks. Nine cuprizone-treated animals received daily injections of polyprenols intraperitoneally at a dose of 12-mg/kg body weight during Weeks 6–10. Nine control animals and other nine cuprizone-treated received sham oil injections. At Week 10, brain sections were stained for myelin basic protein, neuro-glial antigen-2, and doublecortin to evaluate demyelination, oligodendrogenesis, and neurogenesis. Cuprizone administration caused a decrease in myelin basic protein in the corpus callosum, cortex, hippocampus, and the caudate putamen compared with the controls. Oligodendrogenesis was increased, and neurogenesis in the subventricular zone and the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus was decreased in the cuprizone-treated group compared with the controls. Mice treated with cuprizone and polyprenols did not show significant demyelination and differences in oligodendrogenesis and neurogenesis as compared with the controls. Our results suggest that polyprenols can halt demyelination, restore impaired neurogenesis, and mitigate reactive overproduction of oligodendrocytes caused by cuprizone neurotoxicity. © 2019 The Authors Phytotherapy Research Published by John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd</p>"

However, the underlying neural correlates have not been clarified yet. The present study aimed to investigate the relationship between macrostructural and microstructural white matter (WM) integrity and performance on different cognitive measures with prominent PS load. Methods: Thirty-one patients with SPMS were recruited and underwent neurological, neuropsychological, and MRI assessments. The associations between a composite index of PS abilities and scores on various tests with prominent PS load and T1-weighted and diffusion tensor image parameters were tested. Analyses were carried out using voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS). Results: VBM results showed that only the semantic fluency task correlated with grey matter (GM) volume in a range of cortical and subcortical areas bilaterally as well as the corpus callosum and the superior longitudinal fasciculus. TBSS analysis revealed consistent results across all the cognitive measures investigated, showing a prominent role of commissural and frontal associative WM tracts in supporting PS-demanding cognitive operations. Conclusions: In patients with SPMS, PS abilities are mainly dependent on the degree of both macrostructural and microstructural WM integrity. Preservation of associative WM tracts that support information integration seems crucial to sustain performance in tasks requiring fast cognitive processes. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.</p>"

T<sub>1</sub> relaxation, T<sub>2</sub> relaxation, diffusion tensor, MR spectroscopy and volumetric sequences were performed. Mean T<sub>1</sub> and myelin water fraction (MWF) were determined for stable lesions, new lesions and NAWM. Fractional anisotropy was calculated for the corpus callosum (CC) and N-acetylaspartate (NAA) concentration was determined from a large NAWM voxel. Brain parenchymal fraction (BPF), cortical thickness and CC area were also calculated. Results: No change in any MR measurement was found in lesions or NAWM over 24 months. BPF, cortical thickness and CC area all showed decreases in the first year followed by stability in the second year.

There are controversial issues regarding astrocytes and their roles in demyelinating diseases in particular for multiple sclerosis (MS). We aimed to evaluate possible roles for pharmacologic astrocyte ablation strategy using La-aminoadipate (L-AAA) on remyelination in a cuprizone model of demyelination. Male C57BL/6 mice were fed with 0.2% cuprizone for 12 weeks followed by 2-week administration of L-AAA through a cannula inserted 1 mm above the corpus callosum. Rotarod test showed a significant decrease in the range of motor coordination deficits after ablation of astrocytes in mice receiving cuprizone. Results of Luxol fast blue (LFB) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) for evaluation of myelin content within the corpus callosum revealed a noticeable rise in the percentage of myelinated areas and in the number of myelinated fibers after L-AAA administration in the animals. Astrocyte ablation reduced protein expressions for GFAP (an astrocyte marker) and Iba-1 (a microglial marker), but increased expression of Olig2 (an oligodendrocyte marker) assessed by immunofluorescence. Finally, expression of genes related to recruitment of microglia (astrocyte chemokines CXCL10 and CXCL12) and suppression of oligodendrocyte progenitor cell (OPC) differentiation (astrocyte peptides ET-1 and EDNRB) showed a considerable decrease after administration of L-AAA (for all p &lt; 0.05). These results are indicative of improved remyelination after ablation of astrocytes possibly through hampering microgliosis and astrogliosis and a further rise in the number of matured Olig2 <sup>+</sup> cells. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.</p>"
370,2-s2.0-85059554406,Evaluation strategy to determine reliable demyelination in the cuprizone model,"<p>In multiple sclerosis patients, chronic clinical deficits are known to result from axonal degeneration which is triggered by inadequate remyelination. The underlying molecular mechanisms of remyelination and its failure remain currently unclear. In vivo models, among the cuprizone model, are valuable tools to study underlying mechanisms of remyelination and its failure. Since complete and reproducible demyelination of the analyzed brain region is an indispensable prerequisite for efficient remyelination experiments, in this study we systematically addressed which part of the corpus callosum is reliably and consistently demyelinated after acute cuprizone-induced demyelination. Following a novel evaluation strategy, we can show that at the level of the rostral hippocampus, the most medial sectors of the corpus callosum (spanning 500 μm in the horizontal plane) are consistently demyelinated, whereas more lateral sectors show inconsistent and incomplete demyelination. These results precisely define a part of the corpus callosum which should be used as a region of interest during remyelination experiments. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.</p>"
371,2-s2.0-85062211707,Hydroxyfasudil alleviates demyelination through the inhibition of MOG antibody and microglia activation in cuprizone mouse model,"<p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an immune-mediated demyelinating disease of the central nervous system characterized by oligodendrocyte loss and progressive neurodegeneration. The cuprizone (CPZ)-induced demyelination is widely used to investigate the demyelination/remyelination. Here, we explored the therapeutic effects of Hydroxyfasudil (HF), an active metabolite of Fasudil, in CPZ model. HF improved behavioral abnormality and reduced myelin damage in the corpus callosum. Splenic atrophy and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) antibody were observed in CPZ model, which were partially restored and obviously inhibited by HF, therefore reducing pathogenic binding of MOG antibody to oligodendrocytes. HF inhibited the percentages of CD4<sup>+</sup>IL-17<sup>+</sup> T cells from splenocytes and infiltration of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and CD68<sup>+</sup> macrophages in the brain. HF also declined microglia-mediated neuroinflammation, and promoted the production of astrocyte-derived brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and regeneration of NG2<sup>+</sup> oligodendrocyte precursor cells. These results provide potent evidence for the therapeutic effects of HF in CPZ-induced demyelination. © 2019</p>"
372,2-s2.0-85061100399,Fatal bilateral intracerebral hemorrhage following treatment with alemtuzumab for multiple sclerosis,"<p>Background: Alemtuzumab is approved for treating multiple sclerosis. It can, however, cause intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) mediated by an immune thrombocytopenia. So far, only one fatal case of ICH following alemtuzumab treatment in a patient with a normal platelet count has been reported. A connection to alemtuzumab could, however, not be verified because no autopsy was performed on the deceased. Objective: The main objective of this article is to report the case of a patient with normal platelet count, who suffered a fatal bilateral ICH shortly after treatment with alemtuzumab was initiated. Histological signs of increased vascular permeability were found. Conclusion: Under consideration of the clinical cause and the neuropathological findings, it is suggested that a causal connection exists between the alemtuzumab treatment and the ICH, which was possibly mediated by vascular damage. © 2019, Springer Medizin Verlag GmbH, ein Teil von Springer Nature.</p>"

Methods: Based on medical records, we retrospectively evaluated patients with MOG-Ab-positive NMOSD treated in the acute phase who were followed up in the chronic phase at our hospital from January 2011 to December 2017. Results: The patients comprised two boys and two girls aged 3–12 (median, 8) years. Peak MOG-Ab titers were 1:2048 to 1:32768 (median, 1:10240), and the relapse rate ranged from 0 to 1.25 times/year (median, 0.59 times/year); no sequelae were observed in any cases. Lesions other than those of optic neuritis were distributed at the cortex in one patient, subcortical white matter in four, deep white matter in three, and brainstem in one, all of which were disseminated lesions. No lesions were found in the corpus callosum, periventricular white matter, diencephalon, and regions adjacent to the third and fourth ventricles. The lesions tended to be asymptomatic, and two patients aged &gt;5 years had well-demarcated lesions. Conclusion: All the patients showed disseminated lesions in the subcortical region to deep white matter, which were different from those found in MS and AQP4-Ab-positive NMOSD and were consistent with the characteristics of brain lesions in MOG-Ab-positive ADS, including other disease types. © 2018 The Japanese Society of Child Neurology</p>"

Purpose: To demonstrate the detection of NAWM demyelination using direct visualization of short transverse relaxation time component myelin water imaging (ViSTa-MWI) and to compare the results with those of conventional gradient echo and spin echo (GRASE)-MWI. Study Type: Control/cohort. Population: Twenty-five MS patients and 18 healthy controls (HC). Field Strength/Sequence: 3T/ViSTa and GRASE-MWI. Assessment: Using ViSTa and GRASE-MWI, myelin water fraction (MWF) of NAWM or normal WM was compared between MS (all patients or early-stage MS patients) and HC. The comparison was performed for a global WM mask and five regional WM masks. Statistical Tests: A general linear model was applied for the comparison. A statistical power and a minimum sample size for the significant difference were obtained. Spearman's correlation coefficient was calculated between MWF and clinical measures and between ViSTa-MWF and GRASE-MWF for the global WM mask. Results: MWFs of ViSTa were significantly lower in the MS patients than those in the HC in all masks (P &lt; 0.001). GRASE-MWI results revealed reduced MWFs only in global WM, genu, and optic radiation. ViSTa-MWI had higher statistical powers than that of GRASE-MWI (power: ViSTa = 99.2 ± 1.6% and GRASE = 75.5 ± 31.0%; sample size: ViSTa = 18 ± 9 and GRASE = 78 ± 75). In early-stage MS, MWFs of ViSTa were significantly lower than those of the HC in all masks except for centrum semiovale; however, MWFs of GRASE MWI were significantly lower only in optic radiation. Disease duration was correlated with both MWIs (ViSTa; r = –0.437 and GRASE; r = –0.445). ViSTa and GRASE MWFs were significantly correlated in the HC (r = 0.664) and MS (r = 0.768). Data Conclusion: ViSTa-MWI may detect a reduction of MWF in NAWM of MS. Level of Evidence: 3. Technical Efficacy: Stage 1. J. Magn. Reson.

Objective: To establish cut-off values of brain volume loss able to discriminate between healthy controls and MS patients. Methods: In total, 386 patients after first demyelinating event suggestive of MS (CIS), 964 relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) patients, 63 secondary-progressive MS (SPMS) patients and 58 healthy controls were included in this longitudinal study. A total of 11,438 MRI scans performed on the same MRI scanner with the same protocol were analysed. Annualised percentage changes of whole brain, grey matter, thalamus and corpus callosum volumes were estimated. We investigated cut-offs able to discriminate between healthy controls and MS patients. Results: At a predefined specificity of 90%, the annualised percentage change cut-off of corpus callosum volume (−0.57%) was able to distinguish between healthy controls and patients with the highest sensitivity (51% in CIS, 48% in RRMS and 42% in SPMS patients). Lower sensitivities (22%−49%) were found for cut-offs of whole brain, grey matter and thalamic volume loss. Among CIS and RRMS patients, cut-offs were associated with greater accumulation of disability. Conclusion: We identified cut-offs of annualised global and regional brain volume loss rates able to discriminate between healthy controls and MS patients. © The Author(s), 2017.</p>"

378,2-s2.0-85053819092,"Repeatability and reproducibility of FreeSurfer, FSL-SIENAX and SPM brain volumetric measurements and the effect of lesion filling in multiple sclerosis","<p>Objectives: To compare the cross-sectional robustness of commonly used volumetric software and effects of lesion filling in multiple sclerosis (MS). Methods: Nine MS patients (six females; age 38±13 years, disease duration 7.3±5.2 years) were scanned twice with repositioning on three MRI scanners (Siemens Aera 1.5T, Avanto 1.5T, Trio 3.0T) the same day. Volumetric T <sub>1</sub> -weighted images were processed with FreeSurfer, FSL-SIENAX, SPM and SPM-CAT before and after 3D FLAIR lesion filling with LST. The whole-brain, grey matter (GM) and white matter (WM) volumes were calculated with and without normalisation to the intracranial volume or FSL-SIENAX scaling factor. Robustness was assessed using the coefficient of variation (CoV). Results: Variability in volumetrics was lower within than between scanners (CoV 0.17–0.96% vs. 0.65–5.0%, p&lt;0.001). All software provided similarly robust segmentations of the brain volume on the same scanner (CoV 0.17–0.28%, p=0.076). Normalisation improved inter-scanner reproducibility in FreeSurfer and SPM-based methods, but the FSL-SIENAX scaling factor did not improve robustness. Generally, SPM-based methods produced the most consistent volumetrics, while FreeSurfer was more robust for WM volumes on different scanners. FreeSurfer had more robust normalised brain and GM volumes on different scanners than FSL-SIENAX (p=0.004). MS lesion filling changed the output of FSL-SIENAX, SPM and SPM-CAT but not FreeSurfer. Conclusions: Consistent use of the same scanner is essential and normalisation to the intracranial volume is recommended for multiple scanners. Based on robustness, SPM-based methods are particularly suitable for cross-sectional volumetry. FreeSurfer poses a suitable alternative with WM segmentations less sensitive to MS lesions. Key Points: • The same scanner should be used for brain volumetry. If different scanners are used, the intracranial volume normalisation improves the FreeSurfer and SPM robustness (but not the FSL scaling factor). • FreeSurfer, FSL and SPM all provide robust measures of the whole brain volume on the same MRI scanner. SPM-based methods overall provide the most robust segmentations (except white matter segmentations on different scanners where FreeSurfer is more robust). • MS lesion filling with Lesion Segmentation Toolbox changes the output of FSL-SIENAX and SPM. FreeSurfer output is not affected by MS lesion filling since it already takes white matter hypointensities into account and is therefore particularly suitable for MS brain volumetry. © 2018, The Author(s).</p>"

We have used whole-exome sequencing in patients with undetermined leukoencephalopathies to uncover the endoplasmic reticulum lipid desaturase DEGS1 as the causative gene in 19 patients from 13 unrelated families. Shared features among the cases include severe motor arrest, early nystagmus, dystonia, spasticity, and profound failure to thrive. MRI showed hypomyelination, thinning of the corpus callosum, and progressive thalamic and cerebellar atrophy, suggesting a critical role of DEGS1 in myelin development and maintenance. This enzyme converts dihydroceramide (DhCer) into ceramide (Cer) in the final step of the de novo biosynthesis pathway. We detected a marked increase of the substrate DhCer and DhCer/Cer ratios in patients’ fibroblasts and muscle. Further, we used a knockdown approach for disease modeling in Danio rerio, followed by a preclinical test with the first-line treatment for multiple sclerosis, fingolimod (FTY720, Gilenya). The enzymatic inhibition of Cer synthase by fingolimod, 1 step prior to DEGS1 in the pathway, reduced the critical DhCer/ Cer imbalance and the severe locomotor disability, increasing the number of myelinating oligodendrocytes in a zebrafish model.

381,2-s2.0-85059320230,The endocannabinoid 2-AG enhances spontaneous remyelination by targeting microglia,"<p>Remyelination is an endogenous process by which functional recovery of damaged neurons is achieved by reinstating the myelin sheath around axons. Remyelination has been documented in multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions and experimental models, although it is often incomplete or fails to affect the integrity of the axon, thereby leading to progressive disability. Microglia play a crucial role in the clearance of the myelin debris produced by demyelination and in inflammation-dependent OPC activation, two processes necessary for remyelination to occur. We show here that following corpus callosum demyelination in the TMEV-IDD viral murine model of MS, there is spontaneous and partial remyelination that involves a temporal discordance between OPC mobilization and microglia activation. Pharmacological treatment with the endocannabinoid 2-AG enhances the clearance of myelin debris by microglia and OPC differentiation, resulting in complete remyelination and a thickening of the myelin sheath. These results highlight the importance of targeting microglia during the repair processes in order to enhance remyelination. © 2018</p>"

The stearic acid–based SLNs were below 100 nm with almost neutral zeta potential and offered higher drug entrapment and drug loading. Cuprizone-induced demyelination model in mice was employed to mimic the multiple sclerosis–like conditions. It was observed that the MTA-loaded SLNs were able to maintain the normal metabolism, locomotor activity, motor coordination, balancing, and grip strength of the rodents in substantially superior ways vis-à-vis plain MTA. Histopathological studies of the corpus callosum and its subsequent staining with myelin staining dye luxol fast blue proved the potential of MTA-loaded SLNs in the remyelination of neurons. The pharmacokinetic studies provided the evidences for improved bioavailability and enhanced bioresidence supporting the pharmacodynamic findings. The studies proved that SLN-encapsulated MTA can be substantially delivered to the brain and can effectively remyelinate the neurons. It can reverse the multiple sclerosis–like symptoms in a safer and effective manner, that too by oral route. © 2019, American Association of Pharmaceutical Scientists.</p>"

In vivo administration of Sox2 in the adult mouse brain reprogrammed the transduced astrocytes to neurons. In searching for adequate cell source for repairing the myelin insults, here, we studied the possible conversion of astrocytes to oligodendrocyte lineage cells by Sox2, while an extensive demyelination exists in animal brain. Lentiviral particles expressing Sox2-GFP were injected into the corpora callosa of animals fed with cuprizone diet for 12 weeks. Transduced cells were mainly astrocytes that changed their fate to oligodendrocyte lineage cells by time. For further conformation astrocytes received the vector in culture and then transplanted to the animal brains. Tracing the fate of transplanted cells showed their conversion to oligodendrocyte lineage cells. In vitro transduced cell were also maintained in the oligodendrocyte progenitor cell (OPC) induction medium. Produced OPC-like cells were positive for specific markers. This study provides a new strategy for endogenous production of myelinating cells. After optimizing the experimental conditions for safety and feasibility, this approach may contribute into future cell based therapies in patients with white matter insults as like as those with multiple sclerosis. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.</p>"

Nevertheless, further studies are needed to investigate the consequences of stress in MS pathology. In this study, after 5 days of exposure to psychological and physical stress as a repetitive distress modality, rats were treated with cuprizone. The demyelination degree was compared in animal groups using Luxol fast blue staining, immunohistochemical staining for myelin basic protein and transmission electron microscopy. Outcomes revealed that animals exposed to stress prior to cuprizone ingestion, elicit more intense demyelination.

386,2-s2.0-85058036936,Cuprizone-induced graded oligodendrocyte vulnerability is regulated by the transcription factor DNA damage-inducible transcript 3,"<p>Oligodendrocytes are integral to efficient neuronal signaling. Loss of myelinating oligodendrocytes is a central feature of many neurological diseases, including multiple sclerosis (MS). The results of neuropathological studies suggest that oligodendrocytes react with differing sensitivity to toxic insults, with some cells dying early during lesion development and some cells being resistant for weeks. This proposed graded vulnerability has never been demonstrated but provides an attractive window for therapeutic interventions. Furthermore, the biochemical pathways associated with graded oligodendrocyte vulnerability have not been well explored. We used immunohistochemistry and serial block-face scanning electron microscopy (3D-SEM) to show that cuprizone-induced metabolic stress results in an “out of phase” degeneration of oligodendrocytes. Although expression induction of stress response transcription factors in oligodendrocytes occurs within days, subsequent oligodendrocyte apoptosis continues for weeks. In line with the idea of an out of phase degeneration of oligodendrocytes, detailed ultrastructural reconstructions of the axon–myelin unit demonstrate demyelination of single internodes. In parallel, genome wide array analyses revealed an active unfolded protein response early after initiation of the cuprizone intoxication. In addition to the cytoprotective pathways, the pro-apoptotic transcription factor DNA damage-inducible transcript 3 (DDIT3) was induced early in oligodendrocytes. In advanced lesions, DDIT3 was as well expressed by activated astrocytes. Toxin-induced oligodendrocyte apoptosis, demyelination, microgliosis, astrocytosis, and acute axonal damage were less intense in the Ddit3-null mutants. This study identifies DDIT3 as an important regulator of graded oligodendrocyte vulnerability in a MS animal model. Interference with this stress cascade might offer a promising therapeutic approach for demyelinating disorders. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p>"

Four patients with CMTX developing central nervous system (CNS) demyelination compatible with multiple sclerosis (MS) have been individually published. We presently sought to systematically investigate the relationship between CMTX and MS. Methods Over 20 years, 70 consecutive patients (36 men) with GJB1 mutations were identified at our Neurogenetics Unit, Athens, Greece, and assessed for clinical features suggestive of MS. Additionally, 18 patients with CMTX without CNS symptoms and 18 matched controls underwent brain MRI to investigate incidental findings. Serum from patients with CMTX and MS was tested for CNS immunoreactivity. Results We identified three patients with CMTX who developed clinical features suggestive of inflammatory CNS demyelination fulfilling MS diagnostic criteria. The resulting 20-year MS incidence (4.3%) differed significantly from the highest background 20-year MS incidence ever reported from Greece (p=0.00039). The search for incidental brain MRI findings identified two CMTX cases (11%) with lesions suggestive of focal demyelination compared with 0 control. Moreover, 10 cases in the CMTX cohort had hyperintensity in the splenium of the corpus callosum compared with 0 control (p=0.0002). No specific CNS-reactive humoral factors were identified in patients with CMTX and MS. Conclusions We have demonstrated a higher than expected frequency of MS in patients with CMTX and identified incidental focal demyelinating lesions on brain MRI in patients with CMTX without CNS symptoms. This provides circumstantial evidence for GJB1 mutations acting as a possible MS risk factor. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.</p>"
388,2-s2.0-85048061649,G-Protein-Coupled Receptor Gpr17 Expression in Two Multiple Sclerosis Remyelination Models,"<p>In multiple sclerosis patients, demyelination is prominent in both the white and gray matter. Chronic clinical deficits are known to result from acute or chronic injury to the myelin sheath and inadequate remyelination. The underlying molecular mechanisms of remyelination and its failure remain currently unclear. Recent studies have recognized G protein-coupled receptor 17 (GPR17) as an important regulator of oligodendrocyte development and remyelination. So far, the relevance of GPR17 for myelin repair was mainly tested in remyelinating white matter lesions. The relevance of GPR17 for gray matter remyelination as well as remyelination of chronic white matter lesions was not addressed so far. Here, we provide a detailed characterization of GPR17 expression during experimental de- and remyelination. Experimental lesions with robust and limited endogenous remyelination capacity were established by either acute or chronic cuprizone-induced demyelination. Furthermore, remyelinating lesions were induced by the focal injection of lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) into the corpus callosum. GPR17 expression was analyzed by complementary techniques including immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization, and real-time PCR. In control animals, GPR17 <sup>+</sup> cells were evenly distributed in the corpus callosum and cortex and displayed a highly ramified morphology. Virtually all GPR17 <sup>+</sup> cells also expressed the oligodendrocyte-specific transcription factor OLIG2. After acute cuprizone-induced demyelination, robust endogenous remyelination was evident in the white matter corpus callosum but not in the gray matter cortex. Endogenous callosal remyelination was paralleled by a robust induction of GPR17 expression which was absent in the gray matter cortex. Higher numbers of GPR17 <sup>+</sup> cells were as well observed after LPC-induced focal white matter demyelination. In contrast, densities of GPR17 <sup>+</sup> cells were comparable to control animals after chronic cuprizone-induced demyelination indicating quiescence of this cell population. Our findings demonstrate that GPR17 expression induction correlates with acute demyelination and sufficient endogenous remyelination. This strengthens the view that manipulation of this receptor might be a therapeutic opportunity to support endogenous remyelination. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.</p>"
389,2-s2.0-85060391130,Do neural stem cells have a choice? Heterogenic outcome of cell fate acquisition in different injury models,"<p>The adult mammalian central nervous system (CNS) is generally considered as repair restricted organ with limited capacities to regenerate lost cells and to successfully integrate them into damaged nerve tracts. Despite the presence of endogenous immature cell types that can be activated upon injury or in disease cell replacement generally remains insufficient, undirected, or lost cell types are not properly generated. This limitation also accounts for the myelin repair capacity that still constitutes the default regenerative activity at least in inflammatory demyelinating conditions. Ever since the discovery of endogenous neural stem cells (NSCs) residing within specific niches of the adult brain, as well as the description of procedures to either isolate and propagate or artificially induce NSCs from various origins ex vivo, the field has been rejuvenated. Various sources of NSCs have been investigated and applied in current neuropathological paradigms aiming at the replacement of lost cells and the restoration of functionality based on successful integration. Whereas directing and supporting stem cells residing in brain niches constitutes one possible approach many investigations addressed their potential upon transplantation. Given the heterogeneity of these studies related to the nature of grafted cells, the local CNS environment, and applied implantation procedures we here set out to review and compare their applied protocols in order to evaluate rate-limiting parameters. Based on our compilation, we conclude that in healthy CNS tissue region specific cues dominate cell fate decisions. However, although increasing evidence points to the capacity of transplanted NSCs to reflect the regenerative need of an injury environment, a still heterogenic picture emerges when analyzing transplantation outcomes in injury or disease models. These are likely due to methodological differences despite preserved injury environments. Based on this meta-analysis, we suggest future NSC transplantation experiments to be conducted in a more comparable way to previous studies and that subsequent analyses must emphasize regional heterogeneity such as accounting for differences in gray versus white matter. © 2019 by the authors.

391,2-s2.0-85073154752,Neuromyelitis optica,"<p>Neuromyelitis optica (NMO) is an autoimmune, inflammatory and demyelinat ing disorder of the central nervous system with a predilection for the optic nerves and spinal cord. In 2004 the association of NMO with an antibody against the water channel aquaporin 4 (anti-AQP4) was published as a different pathology from multiple sclerosis (MS). Currently the term NMO spectrum disorders (NMOSD) is proposed, because the manifestations of the disease can be more extensive, affecting in addition to the optic nerve and spinal cord, the area postrema of the dorsal medulla, brainstem, diencephalon and typical brain areas (periependymal, corpus callosum, internal capsule and subcortical white matter). NMOSD is also applied to patients who meet the NMO criteria and are negative for AQP4-IgG. Within the latter group, the presence of another antibody, anti-MOG, has been detected in 20%, with a different physiopathological mechanism, but with a similar clinic and a better prognosis. The immunosuppressive treatment in the attack, as well as the long-term treatment in the cases that are indicated, is fundamental to avoid sequelaes and recurrences. The correct diagnosis of this entity is essential since it can be aggravated with the use of drugs useful in the treatment of MS. In this publication we will review the pathophysiology, clinical and diagnostic criteria of NMOSD, and discuss the different therapeutic options. © 2019, Instituto de Investigaciones Medicas.

392,2-s2.0-85073080007,"White matter abnormalities in multiple sclerosis evaluated by quantitative synthetic MRI, diffusion tensor imaging, and neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging","<p>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: A number of MR-derived quantitative metrics have been suggested to assess the pathophysiol-ogy of MS, but the reports about combined analyses of these metrics are scarce. Our aim was to assess the spatial distribution of parameters for white matter myelin and axon integrity in patients with relapsing-remitting MS by multiparametric MR imaging. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-four patients with relapsing-remitting MS and 24 age- and sex-matched controls were prospectively scanned by quantitative synthetic and 2-shell diffusion MR imaging. Synthetic MR imaging data were used to retrieve relaxometry parameters (R1 and R2 relaxation rates and proton density) and myelin volume fraction. Diffusion tensor metrics (fractional anisotropy and mean, axial, and radial diffusivity) and neurite orientation and dispersion index metrics (intracellular volume fraction, isotropic volume fraction, and orientation dispersion index) were retrieved from diffusion MR imaging data. These data were analyzed using Tract-Based Spatial Statistics. RESULTS: Patients with MS showed significantly lower fractional anisotropy and myelin volume fraction and higher isotropic volume fraction in widespread white matter areas. Areas with different isotropic volume fractions were included within areas with lower fractional anisotropy. Myelin volume fraction showed no significant difference in some areas with significantly decreased fractional anisotropy in MS, including in the genu of the corpus callosum and bilateral anterior corona radiata, whereas myelin volume fraction was significantly decreased in some areas where fractional anisotropy showed no significant difference, including the bilateral posterior limb of the internal capsule, external capsule, sagittal striatum, fornix, and uncinate fasciculus.

393,2-s2.0-85071006204,Differential effect on myelination through abolition of activity-dependent synaptic vesicle release or reduction of overall electrical activity of selected cortical projections in the mouse,"<p>Myelination of axons by oligodendrocytes in the central nervous system is crucial for fast, saltatory conduction of action potentials. As myelination is central for brain development and plasticity, and deficits are implicated in several neural disorders such as multiple sclerosis, major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, it is important to elucidate the underlying mechanisms regulating myelination. Numerous mechanisms have been proposed by which the communication between oligodendrocytes and active axons may regulate the onset and maintenance of activity-dependent myelination. We compared two models of ‘silencing' layer V and/or VI cortical projection neurons from early stages by either decreasing their excitability through Kir2.1 expression, an inward rectifying potassium channel, introduced through in utero electroporation at embryonic day (E)13.5, or inhibiting regulated vesicular release through Cre-dependent knock-out of synaptosomal associated protein 25 kDA (SNAP25). SNAP25 is a component of the soluble N-ethylmaleimide fusion protein attachment protein receptor (SNARE) complex, which, among others, is needed for calcium-dependent regulated vesicle release from synapses. In layer VI cortical projection neurons in the Ntsr1-Cre;Ai14;Snap25 <sup>fl/fl</sup> mouse, we found that inhibiting regulated vesicular release significantly decreased the amount of myelin basic protein (MBP, used as marker for myelination) and the amount of myelinated projections at postnatal day (P)14 without affecting the initial timing of onset of myelination in the brain (at P7/P8). Additionally, overall oligodendrocyte maturation appears to be affected. A strong trend towards reduced node of Ranvier (NoR) length was also observed in Ntsr1-Cre;Ai14;Snap25 <sup>fl/fl</sup> corpus callosum. An equally strong trend towards reduced NoR length was observed in Rbp4-Cre;Ai14;Snap25 <sup>fl/fl</sup> corpus callosum at P14, and the g-ratio in the spinal cord dorsal column was reduced at P18. However, no measurable differences in levels of MBP were detected in the striatum when comparing Rbp4-Cre;Ai14;Snap25 <sup>fl/fl</sup> and control brains. Conversely, Kir2.1 in utero electroporation at E13.5 did not significantly affect the amount of MBP or number of myelinated callosal axons at P14 but did significantly decrease the NoR length measured in the corpus callosum. It therefore seems likely that the excitability of the neuron can potentially perform a modulating function of myelin characteristics, whereas regulated vesicular release has the potential to have a more pronounced effect on overall myelination, but in a cell-type specific manner. © 2019 The Authors.

394,2-s2.0-85068861555,Evaluation of myelin radiotracers in the lysolecithin rat model of focal demyelination: Beware of pitfalls!,"<p>The observation that amyloid radiotracers developed for Alzheimer's disease bind to cerebral white matter paved the road to nuclear imaging of myelin in multiple sclerosis. The lysolecithin (lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC)) rat model of demyelination proved useful in evaluating and comparing candidate radiotracers to target myelin. Focal demyelination following stereotaxic LPC injection is larger than lesions observed in experimental autoimmune encephalitis models and is followed by spontaneous progressive remyelination. Moreover, the contralateral hemisphere may serve as an internal control in a given animal. However, demyelination can be accompanied by concurrent focal necrosis and/or adjacent ventricle dilation. The influence of these side effects on imaging findings has never been carefully assessed. The present study describes an optimization of the LPC model and highlights the use of MRI for controlling the variability and pitfalls of the model. The prototypical amyloid radiotracer [<sup>11</sup>C]PIB was used to show that in vivo PET does not provide sufficient sensitivity to reliably track myelin changes and may be sensitive to LPC side effects instead of demyelination as such. Ex vivo autoradiography with a fluorine radiotracer should be preferred, to adequately evaluate and compare radiotracers for the assessment of myelin content. © 2019 Min Zhang et al.</p>"
395,2-s2.0-85068557934,Tracking the evolution of CNS remyelinating lesion in mice with neutral red dye,"<p>Animal models of central nervous system (CNS) demyelination, including toxin-induced focal demyelination and immune-mediated demyelination through experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), have provided valuable insights into the mechanisms of neuroinflammation and CNS remyelination. However, the ability to track changes in transcripts, proteins, and metabolites, as well as cellular populations during the evolution of a focal lesion, has remained challenging. Here, we developed a method to label CNS demyelinating lesions by the intraperitoneal injection of a vital dye, neutral red (NR), into mice before killing. We demonstrate that NR-labeled lesions can be easily identified on the intact spinal cord in both lysolecithin- and EAE-mediated demyelination models. Using fluorescence microscopy, we detected NR in activated macrophages/ microglia and astrocytes, but not in oligodendrocytes present in lesions. Importantly, we successfully performed RT-qPCR, Western blot, flow cytometry, and mass spectrometry analysis of precisely dissected NR-labeled lesions at 5, 10, and 20 d postlesion (dpl) and found differential changes in transcripts, proteins, cell populations, and metabolites in lesions over the course of remyelination. Therefore, NR administration is a simple and powerful method to track and analyze the detailed molecular, cellular, and metabolic changes that occur within the lesion microenvironment over time following CNS injury. Furthermore, this method can be used to identify molecular and metabolic pathways that regulate neuroinflammation and remyelination and facilitate the development of therapies to promote repair in demyelinating disorders such as multiple sclerosis. © 2019 National Academy of Sciences.

396,2-s2.0-85068497775,Structural adaption of axons during de- and remyelination in the Cuprizone mouse model,"<p>Multiple Sclerosis is an autoimmune disorder causing neurodegeneration mostly in young adults. Thereby, myelin is lost in the inflammatory lesions leaving unmyelinated axons at a high risk to degenerate. Oligodendrocyte precursor cells maintain their regenerative capacity into adulthood and are able to remyelinate axons if they are properly activated and differentiate. Neuronal activity influences the success of myelination indicating a close interplay between neurons and oligodendroglia. The myelination profile determines the distribution of voltage-gated ion channels along the axon. Here, we analyze the distribution of the sodium channel subunit Nav1.6 and the ultrastructure of axons after cuprizone-induced demyelination in transgenic mice expressing GFP in oligodendroglial cells. Using this mouse model, we found an increased number of GFP-expressing oligodendroglial cells compared to untreated mice. Analyzing the axons, we found an increase in the number of nodes of Ranvier in mice that had received cuprizone. Furthermore, we found an enhanced portion of unmyelinated axons showing vesicles in the cytoplasm. These vesicles were labeled with VGlut1, indicating that they are involved in axonal signaling. Our results highlight the flexibility of axons towards changes in the glial compartment and depict the structural changes they undergo upon myelin removal. These findings might be considered if searching for new neuroprotective therapies that aim at blocking neuronal activity in order to avoid interfering with the process of remyelination. © 2019 International Society of Neuropathology</p>"
397,2-s2.0-85065419422,Predictors of evolution into multiple sclerosis after a first acute demyelinating syndrome in children and adolescents,"<p>Background/Objective: The aim of the study was to estimate the rate of evolution or for multiple sclerosis (MS), after a first acute demyelinating event (ADE) in pediatric patients, and to investigate the variables that predict this evolution. Methods: We retrospectively evaluated the clinical and neuroradiological features of children who presented a first ADE between January 2005 and April 2017. All patients included underwent a baseline MRI, a cerebrospinal fluid and blood analysis, including virological examinations. The evolution into MS was determined by the 2013 International Pediatric Multiple Sclerosis Study Group (IPMSSG) criteria. Clinical and radiological features predictive of MS were determined using multivariate analyses. Results: Ninety-one patients were selected (mean age at onset: 10.11 ± 4.6). After a mean follow-up of 5.6 ± 2.3 years, 35% of patients' conditions evolved to MS. In the logistic multivariate analysis of clinical and laboratory data, the best predictors of evolution into MS were: the presence of oligoclonal bands in CSF (p &lt; 0.001), past infection with EBV (p &lt; 0.001), periventricular lesions (p &lt; 0.001), hypointense lesions on T1 (p &lt; 0.001), and lesions of the corpus callosum (p &lt; 0.001) including Dawson fingers (p &lt; 0.001). Conclusion: Our findings suggest that a pattern of neuroimaging and laboratory findings may help to distinguish between, at clinical onset, children with a monophasic syndrome (clinically isolated syndrome or acute disseminated encephalomyelitis) from those who will develop MS. © 2019 Papetti, Figà Talamanca, Spalice, Vigevano, Centonze and Valeriani.</p>"

Although the exact etiology of the disease is largely unknown, it is identified that cytokines may play an important role in the pathogenesis of MS. In this study, the effects of curcumin has been investigated on the expression levels of selected cytokine coding genes as well as the extent of demyelination in the corpus callosum of C57BL/6 experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model of MS. Gene expression analyses revealed that treatment with curcumin could lead to a significant reduction in the expression levels of pro-inflammatory cytokine coding genes including IL-6 (p = 0.001), IL-17 (p = 0.001), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α (p = 0.008), and interferon (IFN)-γ (p = 0.033) as well as a significant increase in the expression level of transforming growth factor (TGF)-β (p = 0.006) as an anti-inflammatory cytokine. Moreover, the expression of glutathione peroxidase (GPX)-1 gene and the activity of anti-oxidant enzymes were significantly higher (p &lt; 0.001) in curcumin-treated mice. Luxol fast blue staining also confirmed a significant reduction in the extent of demyelination in the curcumin-treated group (p &lt; 0.001).

399,2-s2.0-85064241873,Expression of translocator protein and [18F]-GE180 ligand uptake in multiple sclerosis animal models,"<p>Positron emission tomography (PET) ligands targeting the translocator protein (TSPO) represent promising tools to visualize neuroinflammation in multiple sclerosis (MS). Although it is known that TSPO is expressed in the outer mitochondria membrane, its cellular localization in the central nervous system under physiological and pathological conditions is not entirely clear. The purpose of this study was to assess the feasibility of utilizing PET imaging with the TSPO tracer, [18F]-GE180, to detect histopathological changes during experimental demyelination, and to determine which cell types express TSPO. C57BL/6 mice were fed with cuprizone for up to 5 weeks to induce demyelination. Groups of mice were investigated by [18F]-GE180 PET imaging at week 5. Recruitment of peripheral immune cells was triggered by combining cuprizone intoxication with MOG35-55 immunization (i.e., Cup/EAE). Immunofluorescence double-labelling and transgene mice were used to determine which cell types express TSPO. [18F]-GE180-PET reliably detected the cuprizone-induced pathology in various white and grey matter regions, including the corpus callosum, cortex, hippocampus, thalamus and caudoputamen. Cuprizone-induced demyelination was paralleled by an increase in TSPO expression, glia activation and axonal injury. Most of the microglia and around one-third of the astrocytes expressed TSPO. TSPO expression induction was more severe in the white matter corpus callosum compared to the grey matter cortex. Although mitochondria accumulate at sites of focal axonal injury, these mitochondria do not express TSPO. In Cup/EAE mice, both microglia and recruited monocytes contribute to the TSPO expressing cell populations. These findings support the notion that TSPO is a valuable marker for the in vivo visualization and quantification of neuropathological changes in the MS brain. The pathological substrate of an increase in TSPO-ligand binding might be diverse including microglia activation, peripheral monocyte recruitment, or astrocytosis, but not axonal injury. © 2019 by the authors.

Among the plethora of involved cells, microglia/macrophages and astrocytes play an important role in the pathogenesis of demyelinating disorders. The in-depth investigation of the spatio-temporal profile of these cell types in vivo may inform about the exact disease state and localization as well as may allow to monitor therapeutic modulation of the components of the neuroinflammatory response during the course of multiple sclerosis (MS). In this study, we aimed to non-invasively decipher the degree and temporal profile of neuroinflammation (TSPO - [ <sup>18</sup> F]DPA-714 PET) in relation to selected magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) parameters (T2 maps) in the cuprizone (CPZ)-induced model of demyelination. Methods: C57Bl6 (n=30) mice were fed with a standard chow mixed with 0.2% (w/w) CPZ for 4 (n=10; demyelination) and 6 weeks (n=10; spontaneous remyelination). The degree of neuroinflammation at de- and remyelination was assessed by [ <sup>18</sup> F]DPA-714 PET, multi-echo T2 MRI, autoradiography and immunohistochemistry. Results: CPZ-induced brain alterations were confirmed by increase of T2 relaxation times in both white and grey matter after 3 and 5 weeks of CPZ. Peak [ <sup>18</sup> F]DPA-714 was found in the corpus callosum (CC, white matter), the hippocampus (HC, grey matter) and thalamus (grey matter) after 4 weeks of CPZ treatment and declined after 6 weeks of CPZ. Ex vivo autoradiography and dedicated immunofluorescence showed demyelination/remyelination with corresponding increased/decreased TSPO levels in the CC and hippocampus, confirming the spatial distribution of [ <sup>18</sup> F]DPA-714 in vivo. The expression of TSPO microglia and astrocytes is time-dependent in this model. Microglia predominantly express TSPO at demyelination, while the majority of astrocytes express TSPO during remyelination. The combination of PET- and MRI-based imaging biomarkers demonstrated the regional and temporal development of the CPZ model-associated neuroinflammatory response in grey and white matter regions. Conclusions: The combination of [ <sup>18</sup> F]DPA-714 PET and T2 mapping may allow to further elucidate the regional and temporal profile of inflammatory signals depending on the myelination status, although the underlying inflammatory microenvironment changes. A combination of the described imaging biomarkers may facilitate the development of patient-tailored strategies for immunomodulatory and neuro-restorative therapies in MS. © Ivyspring International Publisher.</p>"
401,2-s2.0-85064002042,Neuronal activity in vivo enhances functional myelin repair,"<p>In demyelinating diseases, such as multiple sclerosis, demyelination of neuronal fibers impairs impulse conduction and causes axon degeneration. Although neuronal activity stimulates oligodendrocyte production and myelination in normal conditions, it remains unclear whether the activity of demyelinated axons restores their loss of function in a harmful environment. To investigate this question, we established a model to induce a moderate optogenetic stimulation of demyelinated axons in the corpus callosum at the level of the motor cortex in which cortical circuit activation and locomotor effects were reduced in adult freely moving mice. We demonstrate that a moderate activation of demyelinated axons enhances the differentiation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells onto mature oligodendrocytes but only under a repeated stimulation paradigm. This activity-dependent increase in the oligodendrocyte pool promotes an extensive remyelination and functional restoration of conduction, as revealed by ultrastructural analyses and compound action potential recordings. Our findings reveal the need for preserving an appropriate neuronal activity in the damaged tissue to promote oligodendrocyte differentiation and remyelination, likely by enhancing axon-oligodendroglia interactions. Our results provide new perspectives for translational research using neuromodulation in demyelinating diseases. © 2019 American Society for Clinical Investigation.</p>"
402,2-s2.0-85059887489,“Ears of the lynx” MRI sign is associated with SPG11 and SPG15 hereditary spastic paraplegia,"<p>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The “ears of the lynx” MR imaging sign has been described in case reports of hereditary spastic paraplegia with a thin corpus callosum, mostly associated with mutations in the spatacsin vesicle trafficking associated gene, causing Spastic Paraplegia type 11 (SPG11). This sign corresponds to long T1 and T2 values in the forceps minor of the corpus callosum, which appears hyperintense on FLAIR and hypointense on T1-weighted images. Our purpose was to determine the sensitivity and specificity of the ears of the lynx MR imaging sign for genetic cases compared with common potential mimics. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four independent raters, blinded to the diagnosis, determined whether the ears of the lynx sign was present in each of a set of 204 single anonymized FLAIR and T1-weighted MR images from 34 patients with causal mutations associated with SPG11 or Spastic Paraplegia type 15 (SPG15). 34 healthy controls, and 34 patients with multiple sclerosis. RESULTS: The interrater reliability for FLAIR images was substantial (Cohen , 0.66 - 0.77). For these images, the sensitivity of the ears of the lynx sign across raters ranged from 78.8 to 97.0 and the specificity ranged from 90.9 to 100. The accuracy of the sign, measured by area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, ranged from very good (87.1) to excellent (93.9). CONCLUSIONS: The ears of the lynx sign on FLAIR MR imaging is highly specific for the most common genetic subtypes of hereditary spastic paraplegia with a thin corpus callosum. When this sign is present, there is a high likelihood of a genetic mutation, particularly associated with SPG11 or SPG15, even in the absence of a family history. © American Society of Neuroradiology.

403,2-s2.0-85059078902,Diffusion tensor imaging and disability progression in multiple sclerosis: A 4-year follow-up study,"<p>Objectives: Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is sensitive technique to detect widespread changes in water diffusivity in the normal-appearing white matter (NAWM) that appears unaffected in conventional magnetic resonance imaging. We aimed to investigate the prognostic value and stability of DTI indices in the NAWM of the brain in an assessment of disability progression in patients with a relapsing-onset multiple sclerosis (MS). Methods: Forty-six MS patients were studied for DTI indices (fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), radial (RD), and axial (AD) diffusivity) in the NAWM of the corpus callosum (CC) and the internal capsule at baseline and at 1 year after. DTI analysis for 10 healthy controls was also performed at baseline. Simultaneously, focal brain lesion volume and atrophy measurements were done at baseline for MS patients. Associations between DTI indices, volumetric measurements, and disability progression over 4 years were studied by multivariate logistic regression analysis. Results: At baseline, most DTI metrics differed significantly between MS patients and healthy controls. There was tendency for associations between baseline DTI indices in the CC and disability progression (p &lt; 0.05). Changes in DTI indices over 1 year were observed only in the CC (p &lt; 0.008), and those changes were not found to predict clinical worsening over 4 years. Clear-cut association with disability progression was not detected for baseline volumetric measurements. Conclusion: Aberrant diffusivity measures in the NAWM of the CC may provide additional information for individual disability progression over 4 years in MS with the relapsing-onset disease. CC may be a good target for DTI measurements in monitoring disease activity in MS, and more studies are needed to assess the related prognostic potential. © 2018 The Authors.

The cuprizone (CPZ) model is characterized by primary and reversible demyelination, accompanied by oligodendrocyte loss and neuroinflammation. In the current study, we explored the efficiency of Bilobalide in the demyelination and remyelination. The results demonstrate that Bilobalide improved behavioral abnormality and promoted remyelination in the corpus callosum by using Luxol Fast Blue, Black Gold II and myelin basic protein (MBP) staining. We for the first time found that CPZ caused the splenic atrophy and induced the formation of myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) antibody, which was attenuated by Bilobalide. Thus, Bilobalide decreased the loss of O4+ oligodendrocytes possibly through MOG antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity. Bilobalide also prevented the infiltration of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, CD68<sup>+</sup> macrophages and B220<sup>+</sup> B cells within the brain, and reduced the inflammatory microenvironment mediated with Iba1<sup>+</sup>iNOS<sup>+</sup> and Iba1<sup>+</sup>NF-kB<sup>+</sup> microglia after CPZ challenge, accompanied by the inhibition of IL-1β and IL-6 in the brain. These results identify a potent therapeutic efficiency for Bilobalide and highlight clear pleiotropic effects of the compound beyond specific autoantibody and inflammatory microenvironment in CPZ-mediated demyelination. © 2018</p>"

A growing body of evidence indicates that some antibiotics have anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties. Rifampicin, commonly used for the treatment of mycobacteria, has been shown to exert neuroprotective activities in neurodegenerative diseases. In this study, we examined the efficacy of rifampicin on demyelination, gliosis, apoptosis, inflammation, behavioral dysfunction, and biochemical alterations in the cuprizone model of demyelination. For this aim, male C57BL/6J mice were fed a chow containing 0.2% cuprizone (w/w) for 6 weeks to induce reversible demyelination in the corpus callosum. Mice intraperitoneally received serial doses of rifampicin (10, 20, or 40 mg/kg body weight) in the last 7 days of a 6-week period of cuprizone treatment. The results showed that the administration of rifampicin led to the improvement in motor behavioral deficits. In line with this, rifampicin decreased the number of apoptotic cells in the corpus callosum thereby diminishing the expression of cleaved caspase-3 and Bax, as well as increasing Bcl-2. Moreover, rifampicin significantly lowered the levels of interleukin-6, interleukin-1β caspase-12 activity, heme oxygenase-1(HO-1), nitric oxide (NO), and malondialdehyde (MDA) in mice treated with cuprizone. Conversely, the activity of glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and the level of ferric reducing ability of plasma (FRAP) were increased in response to the treatment with rifampicin. Histopathological findings demonstrated that rifampicin statistically promoted remyelination and mitigated microgliosis and astrogliosis. It seems that rifampicin is able to be added to the armamentarium of therapies for multiple sclerosis. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd</p>"
407,2-s2.0-85054072058,A simplified framework to optimize MRI contrast preparation,"<p>Purpose : This article proposes a rigorous optimal control framework for the design of preparation schemes that optimize MRI contrast based on relaxation time differences. Methods : Compared to previous optimal contrast preparation schemes, a drastic reduction of the optimization parameter number is performed. The preparation scheme is defined as a combination of several block pulses whose flip angles, phase terms and inter-pulse delays are optimized to control the magnetization evolution. Results : The proposed approach reduces the computation time of B<sub>0</sub>-robust preparation schemes to around a minute (whereas several hours were required with previous schemes), with negligible performance loss. The chosen parameterization allows to formulate the total preparation duration as a constraint, which improves the overall compromise between contrast performance and preparation time. Simulation, in vitro and in vivo results validate this improvement, illustrate the straightforward applicability of the proposed approach, and point out its flexibility in terms of achievable contrasts. Major improvement is especially achieved for short-T<sub>2</sub> enhancement, as shown by the acquisition of a non-trivial contrast on a rat brain, where a short-T<sub>2</sub> white matter structure (corpus callosum) is enhanced compared to surrounding gray matter tissues (hippocampus and neocortex). Conclusions : This approach proposes key advances for the design of optimal contrast preparation sequences, that emphasize their ability to generate non-standard contrasts, their potential benefit in a clinical context, and their straightforward applicability on any MR system. © 2018 International Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine</p>"
408,2-s2.0-85053562817,Teriflunomide's Effect on Glia in Experimental Demyelinating Disease: A Neuroimaging and Histologic Study,"<p>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Teriflunomide reduces disability progression and brain atrophy in multiple sclerosis patients. The exact mechanism of action by which teriflunomide exerts these effects is currently unknown. We assessed the effect of teriflunomide on brain glial cells in the Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) by using a histological approach in combination with neuroimaging. METHODS: Forty-eight SJL female mice received an intracerebral injection of TMEV at 6–8 weeks of age and were then treated with teriflunomide (n = 24) or placebo (n = 24) for 9 months. They were examined with MRI and behavioral testing at 2, 6, and 9 months postinduction (mPI). Of those, 18 teriflunomide-treated and 17 controls mice were analyzed histologically at 9 mPI to sample from different brain regions for myelination status, microglial density, and oligodendroglial lineage. The histological and MRI outcomes were correlated. RESULTS: Corpus callosum microglial density was numerically lower in the teriflunomide-treated mice compared to the control group (141.1 ± 21.7 SEM vs. 214.74 ± 34.79 SEM, Iba1 <sup>+</sup> cells/mm <sup>2</sup> , P =.087). Basal ganglia (BG) microglial density in the teriflunomide group exhibited a negative correlation with fractional anisotropy (P =.021) and a positive correlation with mean diffusivity (P =.034), indicating less inflammation and axonal damage. Oligodendroglial lineage cell and myelin density were not significantly different between treatment groups. However, a significant positive correlation between BG oligodendrocytes and BG volume (P =.027), and with N-acetyl aspartate concentration (P =.008), was found in the teriflunomide group, indicating less axonal loss. CONCLUSION: Teriflunomide altered microglia density and oligodendrocytes differentiation, which was associated with less evident microstructural damage on MRI. © 2018 by the American Society of Neuroimaging</p>"

Imaging the corpus callosum (CC), a primary site of damage in MS with a critical role in interhemispheric connectivity, may be useful for assessing overall brain health, prognosis, and therapy efficacy. We assessed the feasibility of multisite clinical trials using advanced MRI by examining the intra and intersite reproducibility of T <sub>1</sub> and DTI measurements in the CC and segmented white matter (WM). METHODS: Five healthy volunteers were scanned twice within 24 hours at six 3T sites. Coefficients of variation (COVs) and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) for CC and WM T <sub>1</sub> , fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (D <sub>ax</sub> ), and radial diffusivity (D <sub>rad</sub> ) assessed intrasite and intersite reliability. RESULTS: CC and WM T <sub>1</sub> showed excellent intrasite reproducibility with low COVs (mean =.90% and.89%, respectively) and good ICCs (CC =.78, WM =.90). T <sub>1</sub> also demonstrated intersite reliability (low COVs: CC = 2.4%, WM = 1.8%; moderate ICCs: CC =.43, WM =.69). DTI had low intrasite COVs (CC: FA = 1.3%, MD = 1.5%, D <sub>ax</sub> = 1.4%, D <sub>rad</sub> = 2.2%; WM: FA =.9%, MD =.9%, D <sub>ax</sub> =.7%, D <sub>rad</sub> = 1.2%) and high intrasite ICCs (CC: FA =.95, MD =.97, D <sub>ax</sub> =.94, D <sub>rad</sub> =.97; CC: FA =.9, MD =.66, D <sub>ax</sub> =.88, D <sub>rad</sub> =.63), indicating excellent intrasite reproducibility. DTI also showed excellent intersite reliability with low COVs (CC: FA = 2.1%, MD = 4.1%, D <sub>ax</sub> = 3.4%, D <sub>rad</sub> = 5.3%, WM: FA = 1.3%, MD = 1.9%, D <sub>ax</sub> = 1.8%, D <sub>rad</sub> = 2.1%,) and good ICCs (CC: FA =.90, MD =.84, D <sub>ax</sub> =.72, D <sub>rad</sub> =.90; WM: FA =.83, MD =.34, D <sub>ax</sub> =.62, D <sub>rad</sub> =.41). CONCLUSIONS: T <sub>1</sub> and DTI measures are reproducible using equivalent MRI scanners and sequence protocols. Using a similar MR system, it is feasible to carry out multicenter studies using T <sub>1</sub> and DTI to evaluate changes within the CC and WM. © 2018 by the American Society of Neuroimaging</p>"
410,2-s2.0-85053373721,"Five decades of cuprizone, an updated model to replicate demyelinating diseases","<p>Introduction: Demyelinating diseases of the central nervous system (CNS) comprise a group of neurological disorders characterized by progressive (and eventually irreversible) loss of oligodendrocytes and myelin sheaths in the white matter tracts. Some of myelin disorders include: Multiple sclerosis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, peripheral nerve polyneuropathy and others. To date, the etiology of these disorders is not well known and no effective treatments are currently available against them. Therefore, further research is needed to gain a better understand and treat these patients. To accomplish this goal, it is necessary to have appropriate animal models that closely resemble the pathophysiology and clinical signs of these diseases. Herein, we describe the model of toxic demyelination induced by cuprizone (CPZ), a copper chelator that reduces the cytochrome and monoamine oxidase activity into the brain, produces mitochondrial stress and triggers the local immune response. These biochemical and cellular responses ultimately result in selective loss of oligodendrocytes and microglia accumulation, which conveys to extensive areas of demyelination and gliosis in corpus callosum, superior cerebellar peduncles and cerebral cortex. Remarkably, some aspects of the histological pattern induced by CPZ are similar to those found in multiple sclerosis. CPZ exposure provokes behavioral changes, impairs motor skills and affects mood as that observed in several demyelinating diseases. Upon CPZ removal, the pathological and histological changes gradually revert. Therefore, some authors have postulated that the CPZ model allows to partially mimic the disease relapses observed in some demyelinating diseases. Conclusion: for five decades, the model of CPZ-induced demyelination is a good experimental approach to study demyelinating diseases that has maintained its validity, and is a suitable pharmacological model for reproducing some key features of demyelinating diseases, including multiple sclerosis. © 2019 Bentham Science Publishers.</p>"
411,2-s2.0-85058911020,Structural MRI correlates of PASAT performance in multiple sclerosis 11 Medical and Health Sciences 1109 Neurosciences,"<p>Background: The Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT) is a useful cognitive test in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS), assessing sustained attention and information processing speed. However, the neural underpinnings of performance in the test are controversial. We aimed to study the neural basis of PASAT performance by using structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in a series of 242 patients with MS. Methods: PASAT (3-s) was administered together with a comprehensive neuropsychological battery. Global brain volumes and total T2-weighted lesion volumes were estimated. Voxel-based morphometry and lesion symptom mapping analyses were performed. Results: Mean PASAT score was 42.98 ± 10.44; results indicated impairment in 75 cases (31.0%). PASAT score was correlated with several clusters involving the following regions: bilateral precuneus and posterior cingulate, bilateral caudate and putamen, and bilateral cerebellum. Voxel-based lesion symptom mapping showed no significant clusters. Region of interest-based analysis restricted to white matter regions revealed a correlation with the left cingulum, corpus callosum, bilateral corticospinal tracts, and right arcuate fasciculus. Correlations between PASAT scores and global volumes were weak. Conclusion: PASAT score was associated with regional volumes of the posterior cingulate/precuneus and several subcortical structures, specifically the caudate, putamen, and cerebellum. This emphasises the role of both cortical and subcortical structures in cognitive functioning and information processing speed in patients with MS. © 2018 The Author(s).</p>"
412,2-s2.0-85060829323,Research the neural basis of fatigue in multiple sclerosis amultimodalmri approach,"<p>Background Fatigue is a frequent disabling symptom in multiple sclerosis (MS), but its pathophysiology remains incompletely understood. This study aimed to explore the underlying neural basis of fatigue in patients with MS. Methods We enrolled 60 consecutive patients with MS and 60 healthy controls (HC) matched on age, sex, and education. Fatigue was assessed using the Portuguese version of the Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS). All participants underwent 3T brain MRI (conventional and diffusion tensor imaging [DTI] sequences). White matter (WM) focal lesions were identified and T1/T2 lesion volumes were computed. Tractbased spatial statistics were applied for voxel-wise analysis of DTI metrics fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity (MD) on normalappearing WM (NAWM). Using Freesurfer software, total and regional volumes of cortical and subcortical gray matter (GM) were calculated. Results Compared to HC, patients with MS scored significantly higher on MFIS (33.8 ± 19.7 vs 16.5 ± 15.1, p &lt; 0.001). MFIS scores were not significantly correlated with T1/T2 lesion volumes, total GM volume, or any regional volume of cortical and subcortical GM. Significant correlations were found between global scores of MFIS and MD increase of the NAWM skeleton, including corona radiata, internal capsule, external capsule, corticospinal tract, cingulum, corpus callosum, fornix, superior longitudinal fasciculus, superior frontooccipital fasciculus, sagittal stratum, posterior thalamic radiation, cerebral peduncle, and uncinate fasciculus. Conclusions In this study, fatigue was associated with widespread NAWM damage but not with lesion load or GM atrophy. Functional disconnection, caused by diffuse microstructural WM damage, might be the main neural basis of fatigue in MS. Copyright © 2018 The Author(s).

Objectives To examine whole and segmented gray, white, thalamic, and corpus callosum volume loss in stable patients receiving natalizumab for 2–5 years. Methods This was a retrospective study of 20 patients undergoing treatment with natalizumab for 24–68 months. Whole brain volume loss was determined with SIENA. Gray and white matter segmentation was done using FAST. Thalamic and corpus callosum volumes were determined using Freesurfer. T1 relaxation values of chronic hypointense lesions (black holes) were determined using a quantitative, in-house developed method to assess lesion evolution. Results Over a mean of 36.6 months, median percent brain volume change (PBVC) was -2.0% (IQR 0.99–2.99). There was decline in gray (p = 0.001) but not white matter (p = 0.6), and thalamic (p = 0.01) but not corpus callosum volume (p = 0.09). Gray matter loss correlated with PBVC (Spearman’s r = 0.64, p = 0.003) but not white matter (Spearman’s r = 0.42, p = 0.07). Age significantly influenced whole brain volume loss (p = 0.010, multivariate regression), but disease duration and baseline T2 lesion volume did not. There was no change in T1 relaxation values of lesions or T2 lesion volume over time. All patients remained clinically stable. Conclusions These results demonstrate that brain volume loss in MS is primarily driven by gray matter changes and may be independent of clinically effective treatment. © 2018 Koskimäki et al.

415,2-s2.0-85057253469,Appraisal of cerebral atrophy in multiple sclerosis by means of the corpus callosum index,"<p>Introduction. The course of multiple sclerosis is characterised by the development of cerebral atrophy. It is of interest to monitor it in order to evaluate the treatment response, and the preferred technique consists in performing brain volume analyses, which are currently restricted to the field of research. Aim. To analyse the corpus callosum index (CCI) as a possible alternative to the methods based on brain segmentation. Subjects and methods. Our sample was made up of 109 patients with recently diagnosed demyelinating diseases (90 relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis, 7 primary progressive forms and 12 isolated demyelinating syndromes), and the CCI was calculated in their first magnetic resonance brain scan, together with 101 healthy controls. The sequences of the patients were submitted to a volumetric analysis using the software package MSmetrix. Results. The mean value of the CCI was 0.377 in patients and 0.411 in the controls, and the difference was statistically significant (p &lt; 0.001). The CCI also showed a statistically significant correlation with the brain volume (p &lt; 0.001; r = 0.444) and with the lesional volume in the FLAIR sequence (p &lt; 0.001; r = –0.521), while no association was observed with the volume of grey matter (p = 0.058). Conclusions. The CCI is related to the overall brain volume obtained by volumetric techniques and may reflect the presence of atrophy in the initial stages of demyelinating diseases, which makes it a fast and easy to calculate alternative. © 2018 Revista de Neurología.</p>"
416,2-s2.0-85053490832,N-Phenylquinazolin-2-amine Yhhu4952 as a novel promotor for oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelination,"<p>Oligodendrocytes are a type of glial cells that ensheath multiple neuronal axons and form myelin. Under pathological conditions, such as multiple sclerosis (MS), inflammatory damage to myelin and oligodendrocytes leads to demyelination. Although the demyelinated regions can partially resolve functional deficits through remyelination, however, as the disease progresses, remyelination typically becomes incomplete and ultimately fails. One possible explanation for this failure is the activation of the Notch pathway in MS lesions, which impedes oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) at maturation. This leads to a potential target for remyelination. Here, we have identified a compound Yhhu4952 that promoted the maturation of cultured OPCs in a dose-dependent and time-dependent manner. Neonatal rats showed a significant increase in the expression of myelin basic protein (MBP) and the prevalence of mature oligodendrocytes in the corpus callosum after Yhhu4952 treatment. The compound was also effective in promoting remyelination in cuprizone-induced demyelination model and improving severity scores in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model. Mechanism studies revealed that Yhhu4952 promotes OPC differentiation through the inhibition of the Jagged1-Notch1 pathway. These findings suggest Yhhu4952 is potentially useful for proceeding oligodendrocyte differentiation and remyelination. © 2018, The Author(s).</p>"

The objective of this study was to compare white matter (WM) alterations in BD patients in manic phase (M-BD) and MS patients at early stage of disease and with low lesion burden. We compared diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)-derived fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD) and radial diffusivity (RD) in a priori selected WM regions (i.e., corpus callosum and cingulum) betwixt 23 M-BD, 23 MS patients and 46 healthy controls. Both M-BD and MS showed WM changes in the corpus callosum, which, however, showed a greater impairment in MS patients. However, considering the different sub-regions of corpus callosum separately (i.e., genu, body, splenium), M-BD and MS presented an opposite pattern in spatial distribution of WM microstructure alterations, with a greater impairment in the anterior region in M-BD and in the posterior region in MS. Common features as well as divergent patterns in DTI changes are detected in M-BD and early MS, prompting a deeper investigation of analogies and differences in WM and immunological alterations of these disorders. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.</p>"
419,2-s2.0-85057988856,Tuftsin combines with remyelinating therapy and improves outcomes in models of CNS demyelinating disease,"<p>Though promoting remyelination in multiple sclerosis (MS) has emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy, it does not address inflammatory signals that continue to induce neuronal damage and inhibit effectiveness of repair mechanisms. Our lab has previously characterized the immunomodulatory tetrapeptide, tuftsin, which induces an anti-inflammatory shift in microglia and macrophages. This targeted anti-inflammatory agent improves physical deficits in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of MS. Here, we sought to determine whether tuftsin is also effective in combination with benztropine, an FDA-approved drug that stimulates remyelination, in both EAE and in the cuprizone model of demyelination. We show that combining these two agents to promote anti-inflammatory and remyelinating mechanisms alleviates symptoms in EAE and lessens pathological hallmarks in both MS models. Importantly, tuftsin is required to transform the inflammatory CNS environment normally present in EAE/MS into one of an anti-inflammatory nature, and benztropine is required in the cuprizone model to improve remyelination. Our data further support tuftsin's beneficial immunomodulatory activity in the context of EAE, and show that when studying remyelination in the absence of an autoimmune insult, tuftsin still activated microglia toward an anti-inflammatory fate, but benztropine was necessary for significant repair of the damaged myelin. Overall, tuftsin effectively combined with benztropine to significantly improve MS-like pathologies in both models. © 2007 - 2018 Frontiers Media S.A.</p>"
420,2-s2.0-85057180732,Inter-vendor reproducibility of myelin water imaging using a 3D gradient and spin echo sequence,"<p>Myelin water imaging can be achieved using multicomponent T<sub>2</sub> relaxation analysis to quantify in vivo measurement of myelin content, termed the myelin water fraction (MWF). Therefore, myelin water imaging can be a valuable tool to better understand the underlying white matter pathology in demyelinating diseases, such as multiple sclerosis. To apply myelin water imaging in multisite studies and clinical applications, it must be acquired in a clinically feasible scan time (less than 15 min) and be reproducible across sites and scanner vendors. Here, we assessed the reproducibility of MWF measurements in regional and global white matter in 10 healthy human brains across two sites with two different 3 T magnetic resonance imaging scanner vendors (Philips and Siemens), using a 32-echo gradient and spin echo (GRASE) sequence. A strong correlation was found between the MWF measurements in the global white matter (Pearson’s r = 0.91; p &lt; 0.001) for all participants across the two sites. The mean intersite MWF coefficient of variation across participants was 2.77% in the global white matter and ranged from 4.47% (splenium of the corpus callosum) to 17.89% (genu of the corpus callosum) in white matter regions of interest. Bland-Altman analysis showed a good agreement in MWF measurements between the two sites with small bias of 0.002. Overall, MWF estimates were in good agreement across the two sites and scanner vendors. Our findings support the use of quantitative multi-echo T<sub>2</sub> relaxation metrics, such as the MWF, in multicenter studies and clinical trials to gain deeper understanding about the pathological processes resulting from the underlying disease progression in neurodegenerative diseases.

421,2-s2.0-85060941035,Disruption of neurite morphology parallels MS progression,"<p>Objectives To apply advanced diffusion MRI methods to the study of normal-appearing brain tissue in MS and examine their correlation with measures of clinical disability. Methods A multi-compartment model of diffusion MRI called neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI) was used to study 20 patients with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS), 15 with secondary progressive MS (SPMS), and 20 healthy controls. Maps of NODDI were analyzed voxel-wise to assess the presence of abnormalities within the normal-appearing brain tissue and the association with disease severity. Standard diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) parameters were also computed for comparing the 2 techniques. Results Patients with MS showed reduced neurite density index (NDI) and increased orientation dispersion index (ODI) compared with controls in several brain areas (p &lt; 0.05), with patients with SPMS having more widespread abnormalities. DTI indices were also sensitive to some changes. In addition, patients with SPMS showed reduced ODI in the thalamus and caudate nucleus. These abnormalities were associated with scores of disease severity (p &lt; 0.05). The association with the MS functional composite score was higher in patients with SPMS compared with patients with RRMS. Conclusions NODDI and DTI findings are largely overlapping. Nevertheless, NODDI helps interpret previous findings of increased anisotropy in the thalamus of patients with MS and are consistent with the degeneration of selective axon populations. © 2018 The Author(s).</p>"
422,2-s2.0-85056663905,Guidelines of the Polish Medical Society of radiology for the routinely used MRI protocol in patients with multiple sclerosis,"<p>Magnetic resonance imaging is widely used in diagnosing multiple sclerosis as a basic method for detecting and monitoring the disease. Introduction: Polish Medical Society of Radiology presents the second version of the recommendations for the routinely conducted MRI in multiple sclerosis, which include new data and practical remarks for radiographers and radiologists. The recommended protocol aims to improve the imaging procedure and, most importantly, to standardize conducting MRI scans in all MRI departments. This is crucial for monitoring the patients with MS, which directly contributes to essential clinical decisions. Aim of the guidelines: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory demyelinating and degenerative disease of the central nervous system (CNS) with its etiology still unknown. The fundamental requirement of the disease is the CNS destruction process disseminated in time (DIT) and space (DIS). MR imaging detects focal lesions in white and gray matter with high sensitivity and is the best way to assess brain atrophy in MS patients. It is unquestionably the best diagnostic tool to follow-up the clinical course of the disease and treatment of MS patients. However, to achieve a diagnosis based on MRI scans, and follow-up MS patients according to the latest standards, an MRI scan has to meet certain quality criteria that are the subject of this work. © 2018 Polish Neurological Society</p>"
423,2-s2.0-85055753192,Changes in neurosteroidogenesis during demyelination and remyelination in cuprizone-treated mice,"<p>Changes of neurosteroids may be involved in the pathophysiology of multiple sclerosis (MS). The present study investigated whether changes of neurosteroidogenesis also occurred in the grey and white matter regions of the brain in mice subjected to cuprizone-induced demyelination. Accordingly, we compared the expression of neurosteroidogenic proteins, including steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR), voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) and 18 kDa translocator protein (TSPO), as well as neurosteroidogenic enzymes, including the side chain cleavage enzyme (P450scc), 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/isomerase and 5α-reductase (5α-R), during the demyelination and remyelination periods. Using immunohistochemistry and a quantitative polymerase chain reaction, we demonstrated a decreased expression of StAR, P450scc and 5α-R with respect to an increase astrocytic and microglial reaction and elevated levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)α during the cuprizone demyelination period in the hippocampus, cortex and corpus callosum. These parameters, as well as the glial reaction, were normalised after 2 weeks of spontaneous remyelination in regions containing grey matter. Conversely, persistent elevated levels of TNFα and low levels of StAR and P450scc were observed during remyelination in corpus callosum white matter. We conclude that neurosteroidogenesis/myelination status and glial reactivity are inversely related in the hippocampus and neocortex. Establishing a cause and effect relationship for the measured variables remains a future challenge for understanding the pathophysiology of MS. © 2018 British Society for Neuroendocrinology</p>"
424,2-s2.0-85054735708,"Galectin-4, a negative regulator of oligodendrocyte differentiation, is persistently present in axons and microglia/ macrophages in multiple sclerosis lesions","<p>Neuron-derived molecules are potent regulators of oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelination during brain development and upon demyelination. Their analysis will thus contribute to understanding remyelination failure in demyelinating diseases, such as multiple sclerosis (MS). Previously, we have identified neuronal galectin-4 as a novel negative soluble regulator in the timing of developmental myelination. Here, we investigated whether galectin-4 is re-expressed in axons upon demyelination to regulate the timing of remyelination. Our findings revealed that galectin-4 is transiently localized to axons in demyelinated areas upon cuprizone-induced demyelination. In contrast, in chronic demyelinated MS lesions, where remyelination fails, galectin-4 is permanently present on axons. Remarkably, microglia/macrophages in cuprizone-demyelinated areas also harbor galectin-4, as also observed in activated microglia/ macrophages that are present in active MS lesions and in inflammatory infiltrates in chronic-relapsing experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. In vitro analysis showed that galectin-4 is effectively endocytosed by macrophages, and may scavenge galectin-4 from oligodendrocytes, and that endogenous galectin-4 levels are increased in alternatively interleukin-4-activated macrophages and microglia. Hence, similar to developmental myelination, the (re)expressed galectin-4 upon demyelination may act as factor in the timing of oligodendrocyte differentiation, while the persistent presence of galectin-4 on demyelinated axons may disrupt this fine-tuning of remyelination. © 2018 American Association of Neuropathologists, Inc.</p>"
425,2-s2.0-85054311789,Absence of infratentorial lesions in Fabry disease contributes to differential diagnosis with multiple sclerosis,"<p>Background and Purpose: Multiple Sclerosis (MS) has been proposed as a possible differential diagnosis with Fabry Disease (FD). We evaluated the incidence of infratentorial lesions in FD patients, investigating whether their presence could help in differentiating these two conditions. We explored the diagnostic accuracy of this sign alone and in combination to the involvement of corpus callosum (CC). Methods: White Matter lesions were retrospectively evaluated on FLAIR images available from 136 MS and 144 FD patients. Infratentorial involvement was assessed considering the whole cerebellum, and the part of the brainstem included between the occipital foramen and the upper edge of the red nucleus. Furthermore, the presence of callosal lesions was also recorded, evaluating the portion of CC included between the two external walls of the lateral ventricles. Results: Infratentorial involvement was detectable in 119/136 (87.5%) MS patients, while it was present in only 17/144 (11.8%) FD patients. When the diagnostic performance of a positive infratentorial involvement was evaluated in combination with the presence of CC lesions, a specificity of 97%, with a positive predictive value of 96% was reached. Conclusions: We concluded that the absence of infratentorial lesions, especially when combined to the evaluation of other typical imaging features, can help in the differential diagnosis between MS and FD. © 2018 The Authors.

The Bayesian Risk Estimate for MS at Onset (BREMSO) gives an individual risk score predicting disease evolution into Secondary Progressive MS (SPMS). We investigated whether BREMSO correlates with physical disability, cognitive dysfunction, and regional brain atrophy early in MS. Methods: One hundred RRMS patients with at least two years of follow-up were enrolled. BREMSO score as well as Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) and Multiple Sclerosis Severity Score (MSSS), Timed 25-Foot Walk Test (T25-FW) and 9-Hole Peg Test (9-HPT), were assessed. Intracranial volume (ICV), subcortical gray matter structures and corpus callosum (CC) were automatically segmented on MRI images and their volumes measured. Results: BREMSO score correlated negatively with SDMT at visit1 (β = −0.33, p = 0.019), visit2 (β = −0.34, p = 0.017) and visit3 (β = −0.34, p = 0.014), and positively with MSSS at visit1 (r = 0.38, p = 0.006), visit2 (r = 0.47, p &lt; 0.0001) and visit3 (r = 0.42, p = 0.002), but not with T25-FW and 9-HPT. BREMSO negatively correlated with CC volume at baseline (p &lt; 0.03). No correlations were found with ICV and subcortical gray matter. Conclusions: BREMSO score at onset correlated with physical disability (MSSS), cognitive function (SDMT) and CC volume measurements in patients with early MS. © 2018</p>"
427,2-s2.0-85051133005,Deregulation of the endocannabinoid system and therapeutic potential of ABHD6 blockade in the cuprizone model of demyelination,"<p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic demyelinating disease of unknown etiology in which tissue pathology suggests both immune-dependent attacks to oligodendroglia and primary oligodendrocyte demise. The endocannabinoid system has been crucially involved in the control of autoimmune demyelination and cannabinoid-based therapies exhibit therapeutic potential, but also limitations, in MS patients. In this context, growing evidence suggests that targeting the hydrolysis of the main endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) may offer a more favorable benefit-to-risk balance in MS than existing cannabinoid medicines. Here we evaluated the modulation of endocannabinoid signaling and the therapeutic potential of targeting the 2-AG hydrolytic enzyme alpha/beta-hydrolase domain-containing 6 (ABHD6) in the cuprizone model of non-immune dependent demyelination. The concentrations of N-arachidonoylethanolamine (anandamide, AEA) and its congener N-palmitoylethanolamine (PEA) were reduced following 6 weeks of cuprizone feeding. Deregulation of AEA and PEA levels was not due to differences in the expression of the hydrolytic and biosynthetic enzymes fatty acid amide hydrolase and N-acylphosphatidylethanolamine-phospholipase D, respectively. Conversely, we measured elevated transcript levels of 2-AG hydrolytic enzymes monoacylglycerol lipase, ABHD6 and ABHD12 without changes in bulk 2-AG concentration. Upregulated CB<sub>1</sub> and CB<sub>2</sub> receptors expression, ascribed in part to microglia, was also detected in the brain of cuprizone-treated mice. Administration of an ABHD6 inhibitor partially attenuated myelin damage, astrogliosis and microglia/macrophage reactivity associated to cuprizone feeding. However, ABHD6 blockade was ineffective at engaging protective or differentiation promoting effects in oligodendrocyte cultures. These results show specific alterations of the endocannabinoid system and modest beneficial effects resulting from ABHD6 inactivation in a relevant model of primary demyelination. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.</p>"

A mouse model of acute demyelination was successfully established and the model mice were grouped as cuprizone (CPZ) group, CPZ + small interfering RNA (siRNA)-Notch1 (siNotch1) group, and CPZ + siRNA negative control (NC) group. Meanwhile, another 3 groups (control, control + siNotch1, and control + siRNA NC) were established in normal mice. The changes of weight and maintenance time in rotating drum of mice were observed. Western blot analysis for the protein expressions related to Notch signaling pathway and oligodendrocyte (OL) differentiation in the corpus callosum of the mice. After model establishment, the weight of CPZ-induced demyelinated mice was decreased. During the repair period, the balance ability and movement of the mice was recovered, especially for those injected with siNotch1 plasmid. After model establishment, the number of myelinated axons was decreased. In comparison with the CPZ and CPZ siRNA NC groups, the CPZ + siNotch1 group had a decrease in the number of premature OLs, but increase in mature OLs, and a decrease in oligodendrocyte precursor cells and astrocytes. The expressions of proteins related to Notch signaling pathway, such as HES, Jagged-1 were decreased in the CPZ + siNotch1 group in contrast to the CPZ and CPZ + siRNA groups, but the OL-related transcription factor Sox10 was increased in the CPZ + siNotch1 group than in the CPZ + siRNA NC and CPZ groups, and Id2 was decreased. Our study provided evidence that the inhibition of Notch1 gene could accelerate remyelination in MS. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p>"

We used different key words and medical database sources (e.g., Google Scholar, ISI Proceedings, Medline, Scopus, Web of Science) to search the literature for pertinent articles and reviews on cerebral disease and cognitive disorders dated from 1985 to 2017. This study shows that cerebral diseases can cause cognitive disorders and each of the cerebral diseases can adversely affect the functions of brain. Because human brain is involved in cognitive functions and it is a center for human communication with the surrounding environment and by accepting the fact that these features of the brain essentially distinguish humans from other animals (organisms), the brain involvement in different diseases according to their pathology and anatomical location of the lesion can result in an impairment of human cognition and eventually in various cognitive disorders. Therefore, the early recognition of those diseases is necessary to treat such disorders. © 2018 EDIZIONI MINERVA MEDICA.</p>"

Major deficits arise in MS patients due to an inability to repair damaged myelin sheaths following CNS insult, resulting in prolonged axonal exposure and neurodegeneration. The TAM receptors (Tyro3, Axl, and Mertk) have been implicated in MS susceptibility, demyelination and remyelination. Previously, we have shown that Tyro3 regulates developmental myelination and myelin thickness within the optic nerve and rostral region of the corpus callosum (CC) of adult mice. In this study we have verified and extended our previous findings via a comprehensive analysis of axonal ensheathment and myelin thickness in the CC of unchallenged mice, following demyelination and during myelin repair. We show that the loss of the Tyro3 receptor correlates with significantly thinner myelin sheaths in both unchallenged mice and during remyelination, particularly in larger caliber axons. The hypomyelinated phenotype observed in the absence of Tyro3 occurs independently of any influence upon oligodendrocyte precursor cell (OPC) maturation, or density of oligodendrocytes (OLs) or microglia. Rather, the primary effect of Tyro3 is upon the radial expansion of myelin. The loss of Tyro3 leads to a reduction in the number of myelin lamellae on axons, and is therefore most likely a key component of the regulatory mechanism by which oligodendrocytes match myelin production to axonal diameter. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p>"

However, data is scarce regarding the use of allogenic HSCT in treating MS. We present a 42 years old male with aplastic anemia who underwent allogenic HSCT for severe aplastic anemia. This patient was diagnosed with primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS) one-year post transplant and had to undergo a second HSCT due to his hematological disorder. His second HSCT was conditioned with an alemtuzumab containing regimen, after which his MRI and expanded disability status scale (EDSS) remained to be stable for 18 months. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.</p>"
434,2-s2.0-85052282885,Microglia polarization by methylprednizolone acetate accelerates cuprizone induced demyelination,"<p>Glucocorticoids (GC) are known as inflammatory drugs, which are used in neuroinflammatory diseases. Unlike the classic picture, recent studies have revealed that some GC drugs exacerbate inflammatory responses in their acute and prolonged administration. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a demyelinating inflammatory disorder, in which reactive M1 microglia phenotype play a central role. Since methylprednisolone (MP), as a synthetic GC, are commonly used by MS patients, in this study, we evaluated the effect of long-term administration of MP on microglia polarization in cuprizone (CPZ)-induced MS model. The immunostaining results showed that chronic exposure to MP in the CPZ treated mice increased the number of Iba-1 positive microglia, which significantly expressed IP10 as M1 marker than arginase as M2 marker. MP treatment induced significant amplification in the transcript levels of iNOS and TNF-α (M1-related markers) in the corpus callosum of the MS mice, whereas no change detected in the expression of IL-10 (M2-related marker) between the groups. In addition, evaluation of myelin by luxol fast blue staining and transmission electron microscopy revealed that prolonged MP administration increased demyelination in comparison to the CPZ group. In conclusion, our results show that chronic MP therapy in the CPZ-induced demyelination model of MS polarized microglia to M1 pro-inflammatory phenotype. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.</p>"
435,2-s2.0-85050701403,Multimodal assessment of normal-appearing corpus callosum is a useful marker of disability in relapsing–remitting multiple sclerosis: an MRI cluster analysis study,"<p>Background and purpose: Corpus callosum (CC) is frequently involved in relapsing–remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) allow to study CC macrostructural and microstructural tissue integrity. Here, we applied a data-driven approach to MRI and DTI data of normal-appearing CC in RRMS subjects, and subsequently evaluated if differences in tissue integrity corresponded to different levels of physical disability and cognitive impairment. Methods: 74 RRMS patients and 20 healthy controls (HC) underwent 3 T MRI and DTI. Thickness and fractional anisotropy (FA) along midsagittal CC were extracted, and values from RRMS patients were fed to a hierarchical clustering algorithm. We then used ANOVA to test for differences in clinical and cognitive variables across the imaging-based clusters and HC. Results: We found three distinct MRI-based subgroups of RRMS patients with increasing severity of CC damage. The first subgroup showed callosal integrity similar to HC (Cluster 1); Cluster 2 had milder callosal damage; a third subgroup showed the most severe callosal damage (Cluster 3). Cluster 3 included patients with longer disease duration and worst scores in Expanded Disability Status Scale. Cognitive domains of verbal memory, executive functions and processing speed were impaired in Cluster 3 and Cluster 2 compared to Cluster 1 and HC. Conclusions: Within the same homogeneous cohort of patients, we could identify three neuroimaging RRMS clusters characterized by different involvement of normal-appearing CC. Interestingly, these corresponded to three distinct levels of clinical and cognitive disability. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.</p>"
436,2-s2.0-85055200419,Age Influences Microglial Activation After Cuprizone-Induced Demyelination,"<p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory CNS disease, which causes demyelinated lesions and damages white and gray matter regions. Aging is a significant factor in the progression of MS, and microglia, the immune cells of the CNS tissue, play an important role in all disease stages. During aging, microglia are functionally altered. These age-related changes probably already begin early and might influence the progression of CNS pathologies. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether microglia in the middle-aged CNS already react differently to demyelination. For this purpose, several microglia markers (ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule 1 (Iba-1), P2RY12, F4/80, CD68, major histocompatibility complex II (MHCII), macrophage receptor with collagenous structure (Marco), Translocator protein 18 kD (TSPO), CD206, and CD163) were analyzed in the acute cuprizone demyelination model in young (2-month-old) and middle-aged (10-month-old) mice. In addition, microglial proliferation was quantified using double-labeling with proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU), which was injected with the onset of remyelination. To compare age-related microglial changes during de- And remyelination in both gray and white matter, the hilus of the dorsal hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) and the splenium of the corpus callosum (CC) were analyzed in parallel. Age-related changes in microglia of healthy controls were more pronounced in the analyzed gray matter region (higher levels of F4/80 and Marco as well as lower expression of CD68 in middle-aged mice). During de- And remyelination, a stronger increase of the microglial markers Iba-1, CD68 and TSPO was observed in the splenium of the younger groups. There was a significant reduction of P2RY12 during demyelination, however, this was age- And region-dependent. The induction of the anti-inflammatory markers CD206 and CD163 was stronger in the middle-aged group, but also differed between the two analyzed regions. De- And remyelination led to a significant increase in PCNA+ microglia only in young groups within the white matter region. The number of BrdU+ microglia was not changed during de- or remyelination. These results clearly show that microglia are already altered during middle-age and also react differently to CNS demyelination, however, this is highly region-dependent. © 2007 - 2018 Frontiers Media S.A.

437,2-s2.0-85063690536,A case of primary lymphoma in bilateral middle cerebellar peduncles resembling demyelinating disease,"<p>Primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) is a rare, extranodal form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that is confined to the central nervous system. It mainly involves the deep brain white matter, the lateral ventricle and the corpus callosum. A decline in cognitive function and headache are the typical clinical manifestations of the disease. We report a patient with PCNSL in bilateral middle cerebellar peduncles, whose clinical manifestations were only dizziness and unstable walking. Brain MRI manifestations were not typical in early time, with symmetrical hypointensity lesions on T1-weighted imaging, hyperintensity lesions on T2-weighted imaging, and edema zone around on FLAIR imaging. Enhanced scan showed marginal contrast enhancement, but no significant occupying effect. These changes were similar to the multiple characteristics of multiple sclerosis. The history of autoimmune diseases and cerebrospinal fluid examination highly indicated demyelinating disease. The differences of clinical manifestations, MRI characteristics, diagnosis, treatment and prognosis between PCNSL in bilateral middle cerebellar peduncles and multiple sclerosis were analyzed to improve the understanding of the disease in clinical practice.

438,2-s2.0-85056327870,Quantitative Analysis of Diffusion Tensor Imaging of Subjects with Multiple Sclerosis,"<p>A novel analysis method of magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) was proposed, which combined the voxel-based analysis (VBA) with the white matter parcellation mapping (WMPM). Using this method, the locations and severities of white matter lesions of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients have been clarified. The voxels with significant difference of the fractional anisotropy (FA) and the mean diffusivity (MD) between MS patients and healthy controls (HC) are identified by VBA, and the distributions of these voxels in different white matter parcellations can be determined. It is shown that FA in MS group is significantly lower in 11 parcellations, mainly located at body and splenium of corpus callosum and both sides of corona radiate top. On the contrary, the higher MD is found in 22 parcellations including body and splenium of corpus callosum and posterior limb of right internal capsule. Therefore, the quantitative analysis of DTI through the proposed method provides effective references for the diagnosis and treatment of MS patients. © 2018, Editorial Department of Journal of Northeastern University.

440,2-s2.0-85052463303,MRI in predicting conversion to multiple sclerosis within 1 year,"<p>Objectives: Most patients diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (MS) present with a clinically isolated syndrome (CIS). We aimed to verify previously reported imaging and clinical findings, and to identify new MRI findings that might serve as prognostic factors for a second clinical episode or a change in the MRI scan during the first year following a CIS. Materials and Methods: We identified from our medical records, 46 individuals who presented with an episode of CIS, which was followed clinically and with imaging studies. A neuroradiologist blinded to the clinical data reviewed the images and recorded the number of lesions, lesion location, and the largest longitudinal diameter of the lesion. Results: One year after the first MRI, 25 (54%) patients had progressed to MS. The clinical presentation of those who were and were not diagnosed with MS was predominantly motor or sensory deficit. Patients with lesions that were temporal, occipital, or perpendicular to the corpus callosum at the first episode were more likely to have recurrence. Individuals with a combination of more than 13 lesions, with maximal lesion length greater than 0.75 cm, and a lesion perpendicular to the corpus callosum, had a 19 times higher chance of conversion MS during the following year. Conclusions: Assessment of the number of lesions, lesion location, and maximal lesion size can predict the risk to develop another clinical episode or a new lesion/new enhancement in MRI during the year after CIS. For patients with a higher risk of recurrence, we recommend closer follow-up. © 2018 The Authors. Brain and Behavior published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p>"
441,2-s2.0-85049866633,Distinct regional brain atrophy pattern in multiple sclerosis and neuropsychiatric systemic lupus erythematosus patients,"<p>Differentiation of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) from multiple sclerosis (MS) can be challenging, especially when neuropsychiatric (NP) symptoms are accompanied by white matter lesions in the brain. Given the lack of discriminative power of currently applied tools for their differentiation, there is an unmet need for other measures that can aid in distinguishing between the two autoimmune disorders. In this study we aimed at exploring whether brain atrophy measures could serve as markers differentiating MS and SLE. Thirty-seven relapsing–remitting MS and 38 SLE patients with nervous system manifestations, matched according to age and disease duration, underwent 1.5 Tesla magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), including volumetric sequences, and clinical assessment. Voxelwise analysis was performed using ANTS-SyN elastic registration protocol, FSL Randomise and Gamma methods. Cortical and subcortical segmentation was performed with Freesurfer 5.3 pipeline using T1-weighted MPRAGE sequence data. Using MRI volumetric markers of general and subcortical gray matter atrophy and clinical variables, we built a stepwise multivariable logistic diagnostic model to identify MRI parameters that best differentiate MS and SLE patients. We found that the best volumetric predictors to distinguish them were: fourth ventricle volume (sensitivity 0.86, specificity 0.57, area under the curve, AUC 0.77), posterior corpus callosum (sensitivity 0.81, specificity 0.57, AUC 0.68), and third ventricle to thalamus ratio (sensitivity 0.42, specificity 0.84, AUC 0.65). The same classifiers were identified in a subgroup analysis that included patients with a short disease duration. In MS brain atrophy and lesion load correlated with clinical disability, while in SLE age was the main determinant of brain volume. This study proposes new imaging parameters for differential diagnosis of MS and SLE with central nervous system involvement. We show there is a different pattern of atrophy in MS and SLE, and the key structural volumes that are differentially affected include fourth ventricle and posterior section of corpus callosum, followed by third ventricle to thalamus ratio. Different correlation patterns between volumetric and clinical data may suggest that while in MS atrophy is driven mainly by disease activity, in SLE it is mostly associated with age. However, these results need further replication in a larger cohort. © The Author(s) 2018.</p>"
442,2-s2.0-85049351635,Sulfasalazine alters microglia phenotype by competing endogenous RNA effect of miR-136-5p and long non-coding RNA HOTAIR in cuprizone-induced demyelination,"<p>Sulfasalazine (SF) promotes remyelination and improves the outcome of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. However, the underlining mechanism remains elusive. Here, we examined whether SF blocks microglia switching to a pro-inflammatory M1-like phenotype through a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) effects in cuprizone-induced demyelination. The microglia reprogramming effects of SF in the mice model of cuprizone-induced demyelination was measured by histological, immunohistochemical and molecular biological methods. We also measured the effects of the condition media from SF-treated microglia on the differentiation of OLN-93 cells. Insights of the mechanism of ceRNAs of miR-136-5p and long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) HOTAIR were gained from bioinformatic analysis, luciferase assays and RNA binding protein immunoprecipitation. Microglia switched to a pro-inflammatory M1-like phenotype in cuprizone induced-demyelination. Conversely, SF inhibited the M1-like polarization with the increased remyelination which was attenuated by microglia depletion. SF inhibited production of M1-like factors TNF-α and INF-γ in microglia, and thereby promoted the differentiation of OLN-93 oligodendrocytes. SF down-regulated lncRNA HOTAIR but up-regulated miR-136-5p, and thus inactivated AKT2-NF-κB in cuprizone-treated microglia. Importantly, lncRNA HOTAIR overexpression reversed the increased miR-136-5p expression by SF and thereby attenuated the inhibition of AKT2-mediated NF-κB activation. Mimic of miR-136-5p inhibited cuprizone-induced activation of AKT2-NF-κB in the microglia. In summary, SF blocks microglia switching to a pro-inflammatory M1-like phenotype by ceRNA effect of miR-136-5p and lncRNA HOTAIR in cuprizone-induced demyelination. Our findings show the therapeutic potential of SF for human MS probably by targeting epigenetic regulation in microglia. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.</p>"
443,2-s2.0-85048587576,A stable and easily reproducible model of focal white matter demyelination,"<p>Background: Demyelination is the end product of numerous pathological processes, and also is one of the main causes of neurological disability in Multiple sclerosis (MS). Research into the pathogenesis of MS is hampered by the conventional rodent models’ inability to produce stable demyelination. New method: Focal demyelinating lesions were stereotactically targeted to the corpus callosum with a two-point injection of lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC-2) in mice. Three groups were analyzed (n = 8, each) and water maze, sensorimotor test, and compound action potential were included in functional tests. Electron microscopy was used for morphological analyses while western blot and immunohistochemistry were included for molecular detection. Results: Ten days after the LPC-2 injection, the expression of myelin basic protein (MBP) was reduced, while non-phosphorylated neurofilament (SMI-32) was increased. The amplitude of the N1 segment decreased and less well-defined myelin sheaths was found. Behavioral tests showed increased latency to escape and reduced time spent in target quadrant. Four weeks later, MBP expression still reduced, SMI-32 expression was increased, both spatial learning (D24-D27) and spatial memory (D28) were still significantly impaired in LPC-2 injection mice. Comparison with existing method(s): Compared with the classic single-point LPC-injection model, our studies showed that the two-point LPC-injection not only could induce demyelination in a short-term manner, but also could cause demyelination in a long-term manner with little remyelination in the mouse corpus callosum. Conclusions: We established a simple, reliable, and inexpensive model of demyelination in the corpus callosum in mice, with functional and morphological reproducibility, and good validity. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.</p>"

Patients were followed for one year after disease onset. Patients who experienced a second relapse were defined as those who rapidly advanced to multiple sclerosis. In all, 46 juvenile patients with a clinical presentation suggestive of multiple sclerosis were evaluated; 21 with gadolinium-enhancing lesions on initial brain MRI were excluded as they had already fulfilled the diagnosis criteria for multiple sclerosis. A total of 25 patients, 10 males and 15 females (mean ± SE age at onset 15.6 ± 0.6 years), met the definition of clinically isolated syndrome. The presence of a corpus callosum lesion at onset significantly differentiated between sustained clinically isolated syndrome and patients who rapidly advanced to multiple sclerosis. © The Author(s) 2018.</p>"

In addition to motor, sensory and visual deficits, MS is also characterized by hippocampal demyelination and memory impairment. We recently demonstrated that a recombinant human-derived monoclonal IgM antibody, which is designated rHIgM22 and currently in clinical development for people with MS, accelerates remyelination of the corpus callosum in the brains of cuprizone-treated mice. Here, we investigated the effects of rHIgM22 in the hippocampus and on hippocampal-dependent learning and memory in the same mouse model of cuprizone-induced demyelination and spontaneous remyelination. The degree of hippocampal myelination of cuprizone-fed mice treated with a single dose of rHIgM22 (10 mg/kg of body weight) was examined immediately after the end of the cuprizone diet as well as at different time points during the recovery period with regular food, and compared with that of cuprizone-fed animals treated with either vehicle or human IgM isotype control antibody. Mice fed only regular food were used as controls. Four or five mice per treatment group were examined for each time point. We demonstrate that treatment with rHIgM22 accelerated remyelination of the demyelinated hippocampus. Using two additional cohorts of mice and eight animals per treatment group for each cohort, we also demonstrate that the enhancing effects of rHIgM22 on hippocampal remyelination were accompanied by improved performance in the Morris water maze and amelioration of the memory deficits induced by cuprizone. These results further confirm the remyelination-promoting capabilities of rHIgM22 and support additional investigation of its therapeutic potential in MS. © 2018</p>"

Material and methods: The study comprised 50 patients with relapsing-remitting MS (37 women, 13 men, mean age 36.4 yrs) and 27 age- and sex-matched controls. Using DTI, fractional anisotropy (FA) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values were obtained within corpus callosum (CC), both thalami (TH) and middle cerebellar peduncles (MCP). Disability was assessed using Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), MS Functional Composite (MSFC), Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) and Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS). DTI indices were compared between the patients and controls and in the MS group - referred to disability measures. Results: Significant decrease in FA and increase in ADC within CC and both TH were found in MS patients compared to the controls. DTI indices within CC and TH correlated significantly with SDMT score, and within TH and MCP - with MSFC manual dexterity measure. Conclusions: Changes in DTI measures in normal appearing white and grey matter in the MS patients indicate subtle alterations of the tissue integrity. An occult damage to the strategic brain regions may contribute to various aspects of disability due to MS. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.</p>"
448,2-s2.0-85053547403,Orthologous proteins of experimental de- and remyelination are differentially regulated in the CSF proteome of multiple sclerosis subtypes,"<p>Objective Here, we applied a multi-omics approach (i) to examine molecular pathways related to de- and remyelination in multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions; and (ii) to translate these findings to the CSF proteome in order to identify molecules that are differentially expressed among MS subtypes. Methods To relate differentially expressed genes in MS lesions to de- and remyelination, we compared transcriptome of MS lesions to transcriptome of cuprizone (CPZ)-induced de- and remyelination. Protein products of the overlapping orthologous genes were measured within the CSF by quantitative proteomics, parallel reaction monitoring (PRM). Differentially regulated proteins were correlated with molecular markers of inflammation by using MesoScale multiplex immunoassay. Expression kinetics of differentially regulated orthologous genes and proteins were examined in the CPZ model. Results In the demyelinated and remyelinated corpus callosum, we detected 1239 differentially expressed genes; 91 orthologues were also differentially expressed in MS lesions. Pathway analysis of these orthologues suggested that the TYROBP (DAP12)-TREM2 pathway, TNF-receptor 1, CYBA and the proteasome subunit PSMB9 were related to de- and remyelination. We designed 129 peptides representing 51 orthologous proteins, measured them by PRM in 97 individual CSF, and compared their levels between relapsing (n = 40) and progressive MS (n = 57). Four proteins were differentially regulated among relapsing and progressive MS: tyrosine protein kinase receptor UFO (UFO), TIMP-1, apolipoprotein C-II (APOC2), and beta-2-microglobulin (B2M). The orthologous genes/proteins in the mouse brain peaked during acute remyelination. UFO, TIMP-1 and B2M levels correlated inversely with inflammation in the CSF (IL-6, MCP-1/CCL2, TARC/CCL17). APOC2 showed positive correlation with IL-2, IL-16 and eotaxin-3/CCL26. Conclusions Pathology-based multi-omics identified four CSF markers that were differentially expressed in MS subtypes. Upregulated TIMP-1, UFO and B2M orthologues in relapsing MS were associated with reduced inflammation and reflected reparatory processes, in contrast to the upregulated orthologue APOC2 in progressive MS that reflected changes in lipid metabolism associated with increased inflammation. © 2018 Martin et al.

450,2-s2.0-85046822657,Brain stiffens post mortem,"<p>Alterations in brain rheology are increasingly recognized as a diagnostic marker for various neurological conditions. Magnetic resonance elastography now allows us to assess brain rheology repeatably, reproducibly, and non-invasively in vivo. Recent elastography studies suggest that brain stiffness decreases one percent per year during normal aging, and is significantly reduced in Alzheimer's disease and multiple sclerosis. While existing studies successfully compare brain stiffnesses across different populations, they fail to provide insight into changes within the same brain. Here we characterize rheological alterations in one and the same brain under extreme metabolic changes: alive and dead. Strikingly, the storage and loss moduli of the cerebrum increased by 26% and 60% within only three minutes post mortem and continued to increase by 40% and 103% within 45 minutes. Immediate post mortem stiffening displayed pronounced regional variations; it was largest in the corpus callosum and smallest in the brainstem. We postulate that post mortem stiffening is a manifestation of alterations in polarization, oxidation, perfusion, and metabolism immediately after death. Our results suggest that the stiffness of our brain–unlike any other organ–is a dynamic property that is highly sensitive to the metabolic environment. Our findings emphasize the importance of characterizing brain tissue in vivo and question the relevance of ex vivo brain tissue testing as a whole. Knowing the true stiffness of the living brain has important consequences in diagnosing neurological conditions, planning neurosurgical procedures, and modeling the brain's response to high impact loading. © 2018 The Author(s)</p>"

Radiologists need to know the appropriate imaging angle for viewing. We present six imaging angles for the axial images. Each angle is determined by the reference line. The landmarks on the midsagittal MR image to determine the angle of the reference lines are as follows: the supraorbito-meatal line (the center of the mammillary body and the fastigium of the fourth ventricle), the orbito-meatal (OM) line (the center of the mammillary body and the most posterior point of the cerebellar tentorium), the Talairach anterior commissure (AC)-posterior commissure (PC) line (the superior edge of the AC and the inferior edge of the PC), the Schaltenbrand AC-PC line (the center of the AC and the center of the PC), the subcallosal line (the inferior border of the genu and the inferior border of the splenium of the corpus callosum), Reid’s baseline (the center of the pituitary gland and the most posterior point of the cerebellar tentorium) and the brainstem vertical line (the line perpendicular to the posterior border of the brainstem). The AC-PC line is most commonly used in MR examination. The OM line is most commonly used in computed tomography examination. The supraorbito-meatal line is recommended for avoiding irradiation to the orbit. In cases of multiple sclerosis, the subcallosal line is recommended in the guidelines. For lesions in the orbital cavity, paranasal cavity or skull base, Reid’s baseline is useful. For cases of brainstem lesions, the brainstem vertical line is useful. © The Author(s) 2018.</p>"

Case presentation: We encountered three anti-MOG-Ab-positive Japanese adult patients with brain lesions, but lacking optic neuritis and myelitis. Magnetic resonance imaging detected lesions in the cerebral gray and white matter, brainstem, and cerebellum, and 18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography imaging showed normal or decreased uptake in acute lesions. Conclusions: Patients with anti-MOG-Ab might present with brain lesions only, and lack optic neuritis and myelitis.

453,2-s2.0-85044524682,MMP7 cleaves remyelination-impairing fibronectin aggregates and its expression is reduced in chronic multiple sclerosis lesions,"<p>Upon demyelination, transient expression of fibronectin precedes successful remyelination. However, in chronic demyelination observed in multiple sclerosis (MS), aggregates of fibronectin persist and contribute to remyelination failure. Accordingly, removing fibronectin (aggregates) would constitute an effective strategy for promoting remyelination. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are enzymes known to remodel extracellular matrix components, including fibronectin. Here, we examined the ability of MMPs to degrade fibronectin aggregates. Our findings reveal that MMP7 cleaved fibronectin aggregates resulting into a prominent 13 kDa EIIIA (16 kDa EDA)-containing fragment. MMP7 was upregulated during lysolecithin-induced demyelination, indicating its potential for endogenous fibronectin clearance. In contrast, the expression of proMMP7 was substantially decreased in chronic active and inactive MS lesions compared with control white matter and remyelinated MS lesions. Microglia and macrophages were major cellular sources of proMMP7 and IL-4-activated, but not IFNγ+LPS-activated, microglia and macrophages secreted significant levels of proMMP7. Also, conditioned medium of IL-4-activated macrophages most efficiently cleaved fibronectin aggregates upon MMP-activating conditions. Yet, coatings of MMP7-cleaved fibronectin aggregate fragments inhibited oligodendrocyte maturation, indicating that further degradation and/or clearance by phagocytosis is essential. These findings suggest that MMP7 cleaves fibronectin aggregates, while reduced (pro)MMP7 levels in MS lesions contribute to their persistent presence. Therefore, upregulating MMP7 levels may be key to remove remyelination-impairing fibronectin aggregates in MS lesions. © 2018 The Authors GLIA Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p>"
454,2-s2.0-85039734072,Toll-Like Receptor 2-Mediated Glial Cell Activation in a Mouse Model of Cuprizone-Induced Demyelination,"<p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic degenerative disease of the central nervous system that is characterized by myelin abnormalities, oligodendrocyte pathology, and concomitant glia activation. The factors triggering gliosis and demyelination are currently not well characterized. New findings suggest an important role of the innate immune response in the initiation and progression of active demyelinating lesions. Especially during progressive disease, aberrant glia activation rather than the invasion of peripheral immune cells is accountable for progressive neuronal injury. The innate immune response can be induced by pathogen-associated or danger-associated molecular patterns, which are identified by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), including the Toll-like receptors (TLRs). In this study, we used the cuprizone model in mice to investigate the expression of TLR2 during the course of cuprizone-induced demyelination. In addition, we used TLR2-deficient mice to analyze the functional role of TLR2 activation during cuprizone-induced demyelination and reactive gliosis. We show a significantly increased expression of TLR2 in the corpus callosum and hippocampus of cuprizone-intoxicated mice. The absence of receptor signaling in TLR2-deficient mice resulted in less severe reactive astrogliosis in the corpus callosum and cortex. In addition, microglia activation was ameliorated in the corpus callosum of TLR2-deficient mice, but augmented in the cortex compared to wild-type littermates. Extent of demyelination and loss of mature oligodendrocytes was comparable in both genotypes. These results suggest that the TLR2 orchestrates glia activation during gray and white matter demyelination in the presence of an intact blood-brain barrier. Future studies now have to address the underlying mechanisms of the region-specific TLR2-mediated glia activation. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.</p>"
455,2-s2.0-85046800039,Migraine as possible red flag of PFO presence in suspected demyelinating disease,"<p>Objectives: To investigate a possible association between isolated white matter lesions suggestive of demyelinating disease in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and patent foramen ovale (PFO) evidence in migraine patients, with or without aura. Materials: 31 migraine patients, 28 females and 3 males, with MRI evidence of white matter lesions suggestive of demyelinating disease according to the Barkhof Criteria. All patients underwent further diagnostics including lumbar puncture, autoimmunity panel and cardiological evaluation to detect the presence of PFO. The mean duration of follow-up was 3.46 years and MIPAV software was used to analyze MRI imaging. Results: 14 of the 31 patients (45%) had PFO. A significant association was found between PFO and migraine with visual aura (p &lt; 0.001). No difference in lesion number, volume or area between patients with and without PFO was found, but the distribution was mainly occipital (p &lt; 0.001) in patients with PFO. The follow-up showed a stationary lesion load in all PFO patients; no infratentorial or spinal cord lesion and no enhancement or corpus callosum lesion was ever detected. At the end of follow-up four patients developed multiple sclerosis: younger age at first MRI and oligoclonal bands were associated risk factors. Conclusions: Migraine is often one of the main symptoms leading to MRI, and in many cases white matter lesions of unspecific significance are discovered, thus placing demyelinating diseases in the differential diagnosis. Our study underlines the potential pathogenetic role of PFO in generating white matter lesions in migraine patients (45%), particularly those with visual aura and occipital lesions. For this reason, we affirm that PFO represents a cardinal point in the differential diagnosis of suspected demyelinating disease. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.</p>"
456,2-s2.0-85053404095,mCSF-induced microglial activation prevents myelin loss and promotes its repair in a mouse model of multiple sclerosis,"<p>A pathological hallmark of multiple sclerosis (MS) is myelin loss in brain white matter accompanied by compromised remyelination. Demyelinated lesions are deeply associated with oligodendrocyte apoptosis and a robust inflammatory response. Although various studies point towards a noxious role of inflammation in MS, others emphasize a positive role for the innate immune cells in disease progression. A cytokine well-known to stimulate cell survival, proliferation and differentiation of myeloid cells, macrophage colony-stimulating factor (mCSF), was administered to mice during a 5 week-long cuprizone diet. Treated mice exhibited reduced myelin loss during the demyelination phase, together with an increased number of microglia and oligodendrocyte precursor cells in lesion sites. Tamoxifen-induced conditional deletion of the mCSF receptor in microglia from cuprizone-fed mice caused aberrant myelin debris accumulation in the corpus callosum and reduced microglial phagocytic response. mCSF therefore plays a key role in stimulating myelin clearance by the brain innate immune cells, which is a prerequisite for proper remyelination and myelin repair processes. © 2018 Laflamme, Cisbani, Préfontaine, Srour, Bernier, St-Pierre, Tremblay and Rivest.</p>"
