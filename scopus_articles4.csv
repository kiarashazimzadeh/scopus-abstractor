Normal appearing white matter (NAWM) damage might contribute to the abovementioned disconnectivity. Objectives: To assess the relationship between fatigue and microstructural NAWM damage in relapsing-remitting (RR) MS. Methods: Sixty RRMS patients and 29 healthy controls (HC) underwent a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) protocol including diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Patients with a mean Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) score ≥ 4 were considered fatigued (fatigued MS (F-MS)). Tract-based spatial statistics were applied for voxel-wise analysis of DTI indices. A correlation analysis was performed between FSS score and DTI indices in the entire MS group. Results: Thirty MS patients were F-MS. Compared to HC, F-MS patients showed a more extensive NAWM damage than not fatigued MS (NF-MS) patients, with additional damage in the following tracts: frontal and occipital juxtacortical fibers, external capsule, uncinate fasciculus, forceps minor, superior longitudinal fasciculus, cingulum, and pons. No differences were found between F-MS and NF-MS patients. Fatigue severity correlated to DTI abnormalities of corona radiata, cingulum, corpus callosum, forceps minor, superior longitudinal fasciculus, inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, thalamus and anterior thalamic radiation, cerebral peduncle, and midbrain. Conclusions: Fatigue is associated to a widespread microstructural NAWM damage, particularly in associative tracts connected to frontal lobes. © The Author(s), 2016.</p>"
594,2-s2.0-84994010402,Cognitive event-related potentials in multiple sclerosis: Correlation with MRI and neuropsychological findings,"<p>Background Cognitive event-related potentials (ERPs) have been previously correlated with T2 lesion load (Τ2LL) in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). It is currently unknown, however, whether ERPs also correlate with brain atrophy or the presence of T1 hypointense lesions (“black holes”) which reflect tissue destruction and axonal loss. The primary aim of the current study is to explore the effect of neuroradiological parameters such as brain atrophy, T1 and T2 lesion load on auditory ERPs in MS patients. In addition, we correlated cognitive impairment with neurophysiological (ERP) and neuroradiological (MRI) variables and investigated whether a combination of ERP and MRI parameters is capable of distinguishing patients suffering from secondary progressive (SP), primary progressive (PP) and relapsing-remitting (RR) MS. Materials and methods The study sample consisted of fifty nine MS patients (mean age±SD: 37.82±1.38 years; average disease duration: 6.76±5.3 years) and twenty six age-matched controls (mean age±SD: 41.42±15.39 years). The patients’ EDSS and NRS scores were 3.77±2.14 (range: 1–7.5) and 75.88±11.99 (range: 42–94) respectively. ERPs were recorded using the auditory “odd-ball” paradigm. T1 and T2 lesions were automatically segmented using an edge-finding tool and total lesion volumes were calculated. MRI measures of brain atrophy included third ventricle width (THIRDVW) and the ratio of mid-sagittal corpus callosum area to the mid-sagittal intracranial skull surface area (CC/MISS). Statistical analysis was performed using multiple regression, principal component (PCA) and discriminant analysis. Results T1 lesion load emerged as the most significant predictor of P300 and N200 latency. The rest of the endogenous ERPs parameters (P300 amplitude, N200 amplitude) were not significantly correlated with the MRI variables. PCA of pooled neuroradiological and neurophysiological markers suggested that four components accounted for 64.6% of the total variability. Discriminant analysis based on ERP &amp; MRI markers classified correctly 79.63% of patients in RR, PP and SP subgroups. Conclusion T1 lesion load is the most significant MRI correlate of auditory ERPs in MS patients. Importantly, ERPs in combination with MRI variables can be usefully employed for distinguishing patients with different subtypes of MS. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.</p>"

In chronic lesions, however, the remyelination capacity of OPCs becomes insufficient. Cell therapy with exogenous remyelinating cells may be a strategy to replace the failing endogenous OPCs. Here, we differentiated human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) into OPCs and validated their proper functionality in vitro aswell as in vivo inmousemodels for MS. Next, we intracerebrally injected hiPSC-derivedOPCs in a nonhumanprimate (marmoset)model for progressive MS; the grafted OPCs specifically migrated toward the MS-like lesions in the corpus callosum where they myelinated denuded axons. hiPSC-derived OPCs may become the first therapeutic tool to address demyelination and neurodegeneration in the progressive forms of MS. ï¿½ AlphaMed Press 2016.</p>"

Here we report two such cases, the first in an elderly female patient and the second in a young man. Both presented with encephalopathy, brainstem involvement and worsening upper and lower limb weakness. Initial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain was normal in the first case. Serum for dengue Ig M and NS-1 was positive in both cases. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) showed pleocytosis in both with Dengue IgM and NS-1 positive in the second case but not done in the first. MRI brain showed changes of perpendicular subcortical palisading white matter, callosal and brainstem disease mimicking multiple sclerosis (MS) in both patients though in the former case there was a lag between the onset of clinical symptoms and MRI changes which was only clarified on reimaging. The temporal evolution and duration of the clinical symptoms, CSF changes and neuroimaging were more suggestive of Dengue ADEM rather than an encephalitis though initially the first case began as dengue encephalitis. Furthermore in dengue encephalitis neuroimaging is usually normal or rarely edema, haemorrhage, brainstem, thalamic or focal lesions are seen. Therefore, early recognition of ADEM as a sequelae of dengue infection with neuroimaging mimicking MS and repeat imaging helped in identifying these two cases. Treatment with intravenous steroids followed by maintenance oral steroids produced good outcome in both patients. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.</p>"
597,2-s2.0-84987861947,Acute axonal damage in three different murine models of multiple sclerosis: A comparative approach,"<p>Axonal damage has been identified as a significant contributor to permanent clinical disability in multiple sclerosis. In the context of demyelinating disorders, this destructive event can be the result of inflammation, demyelination and/or the activation of innate defense cells such as microglia or monocytes. The relative contribution of each of these variables to acute axonal injury is, however, unknown. In the present study, we compared the extent of acute axonal damage in three different murine demyelination models using anti-amyloid precursor protein (APP) immunohistochemistry. T cell dependent (MOG<sub>35-55</sub>-induced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE)) as well as T cell independent demyelination models (cuprizone- and lysolecithin-induced demyelination) were used. APP<sup>+</sup> spheroids were present in all three experimental demyelination models. The number of APP<sup>+</sup> spheroids was highest within LPC-induced lesions. Equal amounts were found in the spinal cord of MOG<sub>35-55</sub>-EAE animals and the corpus callosum of cuprizone-intoxicated animals. Moreover, we detected increased immunoreactivity of the pre-synaptic protein vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (VGluT1) in demyelinated foci. VGluT1-staining revealed long stretched, ovoid-like axonal structures which co-localized with APP. In summary, we showed that acute axonal damage is evident under various experimental demyelination paradigms. Furthermore, disturbed axonal transport mechanisms, which are responsible for intra-axonal APP accumulation, do not only disturb APP, but also the transport of other synaptic proteins. These results indicate that, despite differences in their characteristics, all three models may serve as valid and suitable systems for investigating responsible mechanisms of axonal damage and potential protective strategies. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.</p>"

The ability to regenerate oligodendrocytes depends on the availability of neural progenitors called oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) in the adult CNS that respond to injury-associated signals to induce OPC expansion followed by oligodendrocyte differentiation, axonal contact and myelin regeneration (remyelination). Remyelination ensures the maintenance of axonal conduction, and the oligodendrocytes themselves provide metabolic factors that are necessary to maintain neuronal integrity. Recent advances in oligodendrocyte regeneration research are beginning to shed light on critical intrinsic signals, as well as extrinsic, environmental factors that regulate the distinct steps of oligodendrocyte lineage progression and myelin replacement under CNS injury. These studies may offer novel pharmacological targets for regenerative medicine in inflammatory demyelinating disorders in the CNS such as multiple sclerosis.

600,2-s2.0-84997078121,Gray and white matter demyelination and remyelination detected with multimodal quantitative mri analysis at 11.7T in a chronic mouse model of multiple sclerosis,"<p>Myelin is a component of the nervous system that is disrupted in multiple sclerosis, resulting in neuro-axonal degeneration. The longitudinal effect of chronic cuprizone-induced demyelination was investigated in the cerebral gray and white matter of treated mice and the spontaneous remyelination upon treatment interruption. Multimodal Magnetic Resonance Imaging and a Cryoprobe were used at 11.7T to measure signal intensity ratios, T<sub>2</sub> values and diffusion metrics. The results showed significant and reversible modifications in white matter and gray matter regions such as in the rostral and caudal corpus callosum, the external capsule, the cerebellar peduncles, the caudate putamen, the thalamus, and the somatosensory cortex of treated mice. T<sub>2</sub> and radial diffusivity metrics appeared to be more sensitive than fractional anisotropy, axial diffusivity or mean diffusivity to detect those cuprizone-induced changes. In the gray matter, only signal and T<sub>2</sub>S metrics and not diffusion metrics were sensitive to detect any changes. Immunohistochemical qualitative assessments in the same regions confirmed demyelination and remyelination processes. These multimodal data will provide better understanding of the dynamics of cuprizone-induced de- and remyelination in white and gray matter structures, and will be the basis to test therapies in experimental models. © 2016 Petiet, Aigrot and Stankoff.</p>"
601,2-s2.0-84994908394,Intravenous transplantation of mouse embryonic stem cells attenuates demyelination in an ICR outbred mouse model of demyelinating diseases,"<p>Induction of demyelination in the central nervous system (CNS) of experimental mice using cuprizone is widely used as an animal model for studying the pathogenesis and treatment of demyelination. However, different mouse strains used result in different pathological outcomes. Moreover, because current medicinal treatments are not always effective in multiple sclerosis patients, so the study of exogenous cell transplantation in an animal model is of great importance. The aims of the present study were to establish an alternative ICR outbred mouse model for studying demyelination and to evaluate the effects of intravenous cell transplantation in the present developed mouse model. Two sets of experiments were conducted. Firstly, ICR outbred and BALB/c inbred mice were fed with 0.2% cuprizone for 6 consecutive weeks; then demyelinating scores determined by luxol fast blue stain or immunolabeling with CNPase were evaluated. Secondly, attenuation of demyelination in ICR mice by intravenous injection of mES cells was studied. Scores for demyelination in the brains of ICR mice receiving cell injection (mES cells-injected group) and vehicle (sham-inoculated group) were assessed and compared. The results showed that cuprizone significantly induced demyelination in the cerebral cortex and corpus callosum of both ICR and BALB/c mice. Additionally, intravenous transplantation of mES cells potentially attenuated demyelination in ICR mice compared with sham-inoculated groups. The present study is among the earliest reports to describe the cuprizone-induced demyelination in ICR outbred mice. Although it remains unclear whether mES cells or trophic effects from mES cells are the cause of enhanced remyelination, the results of the present study may shed some light on exogenous cell therapy in central nervous system demyelinating diseases. © 2016, Editorial Board of Neural Regeneration Research.

602,2-s2.0-84989905177,White matter tract abnormalities are associated with cognitive dysfunction in secondary progressive multiple sclerosis,"<p>Background: While our knowledge of white matter (WM) pathology underlying cognitive impairment in relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (MS) is increasing, equivalent understanding in those with secondary progressive (SP) MS lags behind. Objective: The aim of this study is to examine whether the extent and severity of WM tract damage differ between cognitively impaired (CI) and cognitively preserved (CP) secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS) patients. Methods: Conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and diffusion MRI were acquired from 30 SPMS patients and 32 healthy controls (HC). Cognitive domains commonly affected in MS patients were assessed. Linear regression was used to predict cognition. Diffusion measures were compared between groups using tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS). Results: A total of 12 patients were classified as CI, and processing speed was the most commonly affected domain. The final regression model including demographic variables and radial diffusivity explained the greatest variance of cognitive performance (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.48, p = 0.002). SPMS patients showed widespread loss of WM integrity throughout the WM skeleton when compared with HC. When compared with CP patients, CI patients showed more extensive and severe damage of several WM tracts, including the fornix, superior longitudinal fasciculus and forceps major. Conclusion: Loss of WM integrity assessed using TBSS helps to explain cognitive decline in SPMS patients. © SAGE Publications.</p>"

Objective: To analyze the significance of cognitive fatigue for subsequent disease progression. Method: We followed 46 MS patients and 14 healthy controls in a study over 17 months. At the beginning (t1) and at the end (t2) of the study participants scored their fatigue, performed the Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite and received MRI scanning, encompassing MPR T1, FLAIR, and DTI sequences. At t1, MS patients were divided into those with and those without cognitive fatigue (cut-off score for moderate cognitive fatigue of the Fatigue Scale for Motor and Cognition). We calculated ANCOVAs for repeated measurement to analyze the relevance of cognitive fatigue status for the number of relapses and for MRI parameters. Results: At t1, but not at t2, patients with cognitive fatigue showed increased axial and radial diffusivity of corpus callosum fibers. At t2, these patients showed significantly more loss of brain parenchyma and greater enlargement of lateral ventricles. Moreover, they developed more relapses, but there was no difference in lesion load or in performance deterioration. Additional analyses showed that only cognitive fatigue but not a more general score for fatigue (Fatigue Severity Scale) had an impact on the worsening of the disease status. Conclusion: Patients with cognitive fatigue may develop more brain atrophy and relapses during the next 17 months than patients without cognitive fatigue. Hence, experiencing cognitive fatigue might indicate more aggressive inflammatory processes and subsequent neurodegeneration. © 2016 Sander, Eling, Hanken, Klein, Kastrup and Hildebrandt.</p>"
604,2-s2.0-84984994863,The crucial role of Erk2 in demyelinating inflammation in the central nervous system,"<p>Background: Brain inflammation is a crucial component of demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis. Although the initiation of inflammatory processes by the production of cytokines and chemokines by immune cells is well characterized, the processes of inflammatory aggravation of demyelinating diseases remain obscure. Here, we examined the contribution of Erk2, one of the isoforms of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase, to demyelinating inflammation. Methods: We used the cuprizone-induced demyelinating mouse model. To examine the role of Erk2, we used Nestin-cre-driven Erk2-deficient mice. We also established primary culture of microglia or astrocytes in order to reveal the crosstalk between two cell types and to determine the downstream cascades of Erk2 in astrocytes. Results: First, we found that Erk is especially activated in astrocytes within the corpus callosum before the peak of demyelination (at 4 weeks after the start of cuprizone feeding). Then, we found that in our model, genetic ablation of Erk2 from neural cells markedly preserved myelin structure and motor function as measured by the rota-rod test. While the initial activation of microglia was not altered in Erk2-deficient mice, these mice showed reduced expression of inflammatory mediators at 3-4 model weeks. Furthermore, the subsequent inflammatory glial responses, characterized by accumulation of microglia and reactive astrocytes, were significantly attenuated in Erk2-deficient mice. These data indicate that Erk2 in astrocytes is involved in augmentation of inflammation and gliosis. We also found that activated, cultured microglia could induce Erk2 activation in cultured astrocytes and subsequent production of inflammatory mediators such as Ccl-2. Conclusions: Our results suggest that Erk2 activation in astrocytes plays a crucial role in aggravating demyelinating inflammation by inducing inflammatory mediators and gliosis. Thus, therapies targeting Erk2 function in glial cells may be a promising approach to the treatment of distinct demyelinating diseases. © 2016 The Author(s).</p>"
605,2-s2.0-84991099371,A mouse model for testing remyelinating therapies,"<p>Used in combination with immunomodulatory therapies, remyelinating therapies are a viable therapeutic approach for treating individuals with multiple sclerosis. Studies of postmortem MS brains identified greater remyelination in demyelinated cerebral cortex than in demyelinated brain white matter and implicated reactive astrocytes as an inhibitor of white matter remyelination. An animal model that recapitulates these phenotypes would benefit the development of remyelination therapeutics. We have used a modified cuprizone protocol that causes a consistent and robust demyelination of mouse white matter and cerebral cortex. Spontaneous remyelination occurred significantly faster in the cerebral cortex than in white matter and reactive astrocytes were more abundant in white matter lesions. Remyelination of white matter and cerebral cortex was therapeutically enhanced by daily injections of thyroid hormone triiodothyronine (T3). In summary, we describe an in vivo demyelination/remyelination paradigm that can be powered to determine efficacy of therapies that enhance white matter and cortical remyelination. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.</p>"

There is lack of knowledge on how the brain overrides these default in-phase movements to enable a required interval of activity between hands. We used a visually cued bimanual temporal coordination (vc-BTC) paradigm with a constant rhythmical time base of 1 s, to test the accuracy of in-phase and out-of-phase (0.1, 0.2,…,0.9) finger tapping. We hypothesized that (1) stronger anatomical and effective interhemispheric connectivity between the hand areas of the primary motor cortex (M1<sub>HAND</sub>) predict higher temporal offsets between hands in the out-of-phase conditions of the vc-BTC; (2) patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) and clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) have reduced interhemispheric connectivity and altered between-hand coupling. Anatomical connectivity was determined by fractional anisotropy of callosal hand motor fibers (FA-hCMF). Effective connectivity was probed by short interval interhemispheric inhibition (S-IHI) using paired-coil transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). In healthy subjects, higher FA-hCMF and S-IHI correlated with higher temporal offsets between hands in the out-of-phase conditions of the tapping test. FA-hCMF was reduced in patients with RRMS but not in CIS, while S-IHI was reduced in both patient groups. These abnormalities were associated with smaller temporal offsets between hands leading to less deviation from the required phasing in the out-of-phase tapping conditions. Findings provide multiple levels of evidence that callosal anatomical and effective connectivity between the hand areas of the motor cortices play important roles in visually cued bimanual temporal coordination performance. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.</p>"

The protective effects of melatonin (MLT) on various neurodegenerative diseases, including MS, have been suggested. In the present study, we examined the effect of MLT on demyelination, apoptosis, inflammation, and behavioral dysfunctions in the cuprizone toxic model of demyelination. C57BL/6J mice were fed a chaw containing 0.2 % cuprizone for 5 weeks and received two doses of MLT (50 and 100 mg/kg) intraperitoneally for the last 7 days of cuprizone diet. Administration of MLT improved motor behavior deficits induced by cuprizone diet. MLT dose-dependently decreased the mean number of apoptotic cells via decreasing caspase-3 and Bax as well as increasing Bcl-2 levels. In addition, MLT significantly enhanced nuclear factor-κB activation and decreased heme oxygenase-1 level. However, MLT had no effect on interleukin-6 and myelin protein production. Our data revealed that MLT improved neurological deficits and enhanced cell survival but was not able to initiate myelin production in the cuprizone model of demyelination. These findings may be important for the design of potential MLT therapy in demyelinating disorders, such as MS. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.</p>"
610,2-s2.0-84983242557,"Evaluation of pregnancy outcomes from the Tysabri® (natalizumab) pregnancy exposure registry: A global, observational, follow-up study","<p>Background: Patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) or Crohn's disease (CD) being treated with natalizumab (Tysabri®, Biogen) who are planning to become pregnant or discover they are pregnant after exposure to natalizumab are currently advised to balance the potential benefits and potential risks of exposure when considering treatment options. This study was undertaken to evaluate pregnancy outcomes of women with MS or CD who were exposed to natalizumab at any time within 3 months prior to conception or during pregnancy. A pregnancy registry was created to better understand the effect of natalizumab exposure on pregnancy outcomes. Methods: The Tysabri Pregnancy Exposure Registry was a global, observational exposure registration and follow-up study. Evaluations included spontaneous abortions (&lt;22 weeks gestational age), fetal losses (≥22 weeks gestational age), ectopic pregnancies, elective or therapeutic terminations, stillbirths, birth defects, and live births. Birth defects were reviewed and coded in accordance with the Metropolitan Atlanta Congenital Defects Program (MACDP) classification of birth defects. Results: A total of 369 patients with MS and 7 patients with CD were enrolled prospectively, of whom 355 patients (99.4 %; 349 MS and 6 CD) had known pregnancy outcomes (including 8 twin sets). The spontaneous abortion rate was 9.0 % (n = 32; 95 % confidence interval [C. I.], 6.3-12.5 %). An independent advisory committee review determined the major birth defect rate to be 5.05 % (16 of 316 live births + 1 elective abortion; 95 % C. I., 2.9-8.1 %). The mean gestational age of the live-born infants was 38.3 weeks, and the mean birth weight was 3158.3 g. Conclusions: Although the overall rate of birth defects was higher than that observed by the MACDP, these registry outcomes showed no specific pattern of malformations that would suggest a drug effect, and the spontaneous abortion rate was consistent with that of the general population.

611,2-s2.0-84983349132,Cuprizone demyelination induces a unique inflammatory response in the subventricular zone,"<p>Background: Cuprizone leads to demyelination of the corpus callosum (CC) and activates progenitor cells in the adjacent subventricular zone (SVZ), a stem cell niche which contributes to remyelination. The healthy SVZ contains semi-activated microglia and constitutively expresses the pro-inflammatory molecule galectin-3 (Gal-3) suggesting the niche uniquely regulates inflammation. Methods: We studied the inflammatory response to cuprizone in the SVZ and CC in Gal-3 knockout mice using immunohistochemistry and with the in vitro neurosphere assay. Results: Cuprizone caused loss of myelin basic protein (MBP) immunofluorescence in the CC suggesting demyelination. Cuprizone increased the density of CD45+/Iba1+ microglial cells and also increased Gal-3 expression in the CC. Surprisingly, the number of Gal-3+ and CD45+ cells decreased in the SVZ after cuprizone, suggesting inflammation was selectively reduced therein. Inflammation can regulate SVZ proliferation and indeed the number of phosphohistone H3+ (PHi3+) cells decreased in the SVZ but increased in the CC in both genotypes after cuprizone treatment. BrdU+ SVZ cell numbers also decreased in the SVZ after cuprizone, and this effect was significantly greater at 3 weeks in Gal-3 <sup>-/-</sup> mice compared to WT, suggesting Gal-3 normally limits SVZ cell emigration following cuprizone treatment. Conclusions: This study reveals a uniquely regulated inflammatory response in the SVZ and shows that Gal-3 participates in remyelination in the cuprizone model. This contrasts with more severe models of demyelination which induce SVZ inflammation and suggests the extent of demyelination affects the SVZ neurogenic response. © 2016 The Author(s).</p>"

613,2-s2.0-84975066520,Multifocal inflammatory demyelination in a patient with rheumatoid arthritis and treatment complications,"<p>Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and multiple sclerosis (MS) are both autoimmune diseases that share similar pathogenesis, but the development of MS in RA patients without the treatment of anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha is rarely reported, which might be attributed to the use of other medications with potential immunosuppressive effects in the treatment of RA. Since MS can be clinically silent and autopsy examination of the central nervous system in RA patients is rarely described, the association of MS with RA may be possibly under-recognized. We report an autopsy case revealing multifocal inflammatory demyelination in a RA patient who had a prolonged use of methotrexate and hydroxychloroquine resulting in hydroxychloroquine-induced myopathies and heart failure. The neuropathological features of this case are consistent with MS, although there are some altered inflammatory demyelinating features such as relatively smaller lesions and less infiltration of inflammatory cells, particularly T-cells. Our present case, in combination with literature review, suggests that the RA treatment especially with hydroxychloroquine and methotrexate is likely to alter the characteristics of inflammatory demyelination and disease course. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

615,2-s2.0-84978920165,"A surface-based technique for mapping homotopic interhemispheric connectivity: Development, characterization, and clinical application","<p>The functional organization of the human brain consists of a high degree of connectivity between interhemispheric homologous regions. The degree of homotopic organization is known to vary across the cortex and homotopic connectivity is high in regions that share cross-hemisphere structural connections or are activated by common input streams (e.g., the visual system). Damage to one or both regions, as well as damage to the connections between homotopic regions, could disrupt this functional organization. Here were introduce and test a computationally efficient technique, surface-based homotopic interhermispheric connectivity (sHIC), that leverages surface-based registration and processing techniques in an attempt to improve the spatial specificity and accuracy of cortical interhemispheric connectivity estimated with resting state functional connectivity. This technique is shown to be reliable both within and across subjects. sHIC is also characterized in a dataset of nearly 1000 subjects. We confirm previous results showing increased interhemispheric connectivity in primary sensory regions, and reveal a novel rostro-caudal functionally defined network level pattern of sHIC across the brain. In addition, we demonstrate a structural–functional relationship between sHIC and atrophy of the corpus callosum in multiple sclerosis (r = 0.2979, p = 0.0461). sHIC presents as a sensitive and reliable measure of cortical homotopy that may prove useful as a biomarker in neurologic disease.

Fingolimod, an immunomodulating agent used in the treatment of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis, has also been suggested to impart a cardioprotective role in heart failure and arrhythmia via activation of P21-activated kinase-1 (Pak1). In the brain, Pak1 activation has been shown to correlate with decreased survival time amongst patients with glioblastoma. A molecular mechanism underlying a link between fingolimod use and glioblastoma development may involve activation of Pak1.

617,2-s2.0-84991710741,Parameterization of White Matter Manifold-Like Structures Using Principal Surfaces,"<p>In this article, we are concerned with data generated from a diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) experiment. The goal is to parameterize manifold-like white matter tracts, such as the corpus callosum, using principal surfaces. The problem is approached by finding a geometrically motivated surface-based representation of the corpus callosum and visualized fractional anisotropy (FA) values projected onto the surface. The method also applies to any other diffusion summary. An algorithm is proposed that (a) constructs the principal surface of a corpus callosum; (b) flattens the surface into a parametric two-dimensional (2D) map; and (c) projects associated FA values on the map. The algorithm is applied to a longitudinal study containing 466 diffusion tensor images of 176 multiple sclerosis (MS) patients observed at multiple visits. For each subject and visit, the study contains a registered DTI scan of the corpus callosum at roughly 20,000 voxels. Extensive simulation studies demonstrate fast convergence and robust performance of the algorithm under a variety of challenging scenarios. © 2016 American Statistical Association.</p>"

Methods: Ten-week-old C57BL/6J, TLR4<sup>-/-</sup>, and MyD88<sup>-/-</sup> mice received 0.25% cuprizone for 6 weeks and were treated daily with 25 mg/kg laquinimod or vehicle. After 6 weeks of demyelination, extent of demyelination, oligodendrocyte density, microglia infiltration, and axonal damage were analyzed in the corpus callosum. Additionally, we analyzed primary mouse astrocytes from C57BL/6J, TLR4<sup>-/-</sup>, MyD88<sup>-/-</sup>, and TRIF<sup>-/-</sup> mice for alteration in NF-κB signaling. Results: Vehicle-treated controls from C57BL/6J, TLR4<sup>-/-</sup>, and MyD88<sup>-/-</sup> mice displayed extensive callosal demyelination as well as microglial activation. In contrast, mice treated with 25 mg/kg laquinimod showed mainly intact callosal myelin. The demyelination score was significantly higher in all untreated mice compared to mice treated with laquinimod. There were significantly fewer APP-positive axonal spheroids, Mac3-positive macrophages/microglia, and less oligodendrocyte apoptosis in the corpus callosum of laquinimod-treated mice in comparison to untreated controls. Stimulated primary mouse astrocytes from laquinimod-treated groups show reduced NF-kB activation compared to vehicle-treated controls. Conclusions: Our results confirm that laquinimod prevents demyelination in the cuprizone mouse model for multiple sclerosis via downregulation of NF-kB activation. This laquinimod effect, however, does not involve upstream Toll-like receptor signaling. © 2016 American Academy of Neurology.</p>"

Thirty-two patients with relapsing–remitting MS and 19 age- and gender-matched healthy controls underwent MRI and neurological examination. Maps of mean diffusivity, fractional anisotropy and WMTI metrics (intra-axonal diffusivity, axonal water fraction, tortuosity and axial and radial extra-axonal diffusivity) were created. Tract-based spatial statistics analysis was performed to assess for differences in the NAWM between patients and controls. A region of interest analysis of the corpus callosum was also performed to assess for group differences and to evaluate correlations between WMTI metrics and measures of disease severity. Mean diffusivity and radial extra-axonal diffusivity were significantly increased while fractional anisotropy, axonal water fraction, intra-axonal diffusivity and tortuosity were decreased in MS patients compared with controls (p values ranging from &lt;0.001 to &lt;0.05). Axonal water fraction in the corpus callosum was significantly associated with the expanded disability status scale score (ρ = −0.39, p = 0.035). With the exception of the axial extra-axonal diffusivity, all metrics were correlated with the symbol digits modality test score (p values ranging from 0.001 to &lt;0.05). WMTI metrics are thus sensitive to changes in the NAWM of MS patients and might provide a more pathologically specific, clinically meaningful and practical complement to standard diffusion tensor imaging-derived metrics. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.</p>"

Our objective was to identify brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings that differentiate these two disorders. Methods: A cross-sectional study was performed including 14 patients with MS with cavitary lesions and 14 patients with VWMD. Two neuroradiologists retrospectively reviewed the MRI including at least T1-, T2- and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery weighted images. Results: The main differences included ovoid lesions perpendicular to the lateral ventricle, punctate isolated juxtacortical lesions (both 100% in MS versus 0% in VWMD) and symmetrical infratentorial hyperintensities (0% in MS versus 50% in VWMD). Other statistically significant differences included midbrain (79% in MS versus 29% in VWMD) and thalamus lesions (71% vs. 7%) as well as extensive external capsule involvement (29% vs. 86%) and extensive corpus callosum lesions (64% vs. 100%). Cavitary lesions usually had periventricular predominance in MS (36% vs. 0%) whereas they were more frequently anterior in VWMD (0% in MS versus 57% in VWMD). Conclusion: Despite many similar MRI findings, our results suggest that a careful analysis of the morphology and the location of the lesions is helpful to differentiate these distinct disorders. © 2016 European Academy of Neurology.</p>"

Furthermore, the capacity for diffusion tensor imaging to act as a proxy measure of cerebral pathology in multiple sclerosis and spinal cord injury has recently been demonstrated. However, the use of diffusion tensor imaging to investigate cytopathological changes in communicating hydrocephalus is yet to occur. Hence, this study aimed to determine whether decorin treatment influences alterations in diffusion tensor imaging parameters and cytopathology in experimental communicating hydrocephalus. Moreover, the study also explored whether diffusion tensor imaging parameters correlate with cellular pathology in communicating hydrocephalus. Methods: Accordingly, communicating hydrocephalus was induced by injecting kaolin into the basal cisterns in 3-week old rats followed immediately by 14 days of continuous intraventricular delivery of either human recombinant decorin (n = 5) or vehicle (n = 6). Four rats remained as intact controls and a further four rats served as kaolin only controls. At 14-days post-kaolin, just prior to sacrifice, routine magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging was conducted and the mean diffusivity, fractional anisotropy, radial and axial diffusivity of seven cerebral regions were assessed by voxel-based analysis in the corpus callosum, periventricular white matter, caudal internal capsule, CA1 hippocampus, and outer and inner parietal cortex. Myelin integrity, gliosis and aquaporin-4 levels were evaluated by post-mortem immunohistochemistry in the CA3 hippocampus and in the caudal brain of the same cerebral structures analysed by diffusion tensor imaging. Results: Decorin significantly decreased myelin damage in the caudal internal capsule and prevented caudal periventricular white matter oedema and astrogliosis. Furthermore, decorin treatment prevented the increase in caudal periventricular white matter mean diffusivity (p = 0.032) as well as caudal corpus callosum axial diffusivity (p = 0.004) and radial diffusivity (p = 0.034). Furthermore, diffusion tensor imaging parameters correlated primarily with periventricular white matter astrocyte and aquaporin-4 levels. Conclusions: Overall, these findings suggest that decorin has the therapeutic potential to reduce white matter cytopathology in hydrocephalus. Moreover, diffusion tensor imaging is a useful tool to provide surrogate measures of periventricular white matter pathology in communicating hydrocephalus. © 2016 The Author(s).</p>"
627,2-s2.0-84969268585,Astrocytes in oligodendrocyte lineage development and white matter pathology,"<p>White matter is primarily composed of myelin and myelinated axons. Structural and functional completeness of myelin is critical for the reliable and efficient transmission of information. White matter injury has been associated with the development of many demyelinating diseases. Despite a variety of scientific advances aimed at promoting re-myelination, their benefit has proven at best to be marginal. Research suggests that the failure of the re-myelination process may be the result of an unfavorable microenvironment. Astrocytes, are the most ample and diverse type of glial cells in central nervous system (CNS) which display multiple functions for the cells of the oligodendrocytes lineage. As such, much attention has recently been drawn to astrocyte function in terms of white matter myelin repair. They are different in white matter from those in gray matter in specific regards to development, morphology, location, protein expression and other supportive functions. During the process of demyelination and re-myelination, the functions of astrocytes are dynamic in that they are able to change functions in accordance to different time points, triggers or reactive pathways resulting in vastly different biologic effects. They have pivotal effects on oligodendrocytes and other cell types in the oligodendrocyte lineage by serving as an energy supplier, a participant of immunological and inflammatory functions, a source of trophic factors and iron and a sustainer of homeostasis. Astrocytic impairment has been shown to be directly linked to the development of neuromyelities optica (NMO). In addition, astroctyes have also been implicated in other white matter conditions such as psychiatric disorders and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD), multiple sclerosis (MS) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Inhibiting specifically detrimental signaling pathways in astrocytes while preserving their beneficial functions may be a promising approach for remyelination strategies. As such, the ability to manipulate astrocyte function represents a novel therapeutic approach that can repair the damaged myelin that is known to occur in a variety of white matter-related disorders. © 2016 Li, Zhang, Chu, Namaka, Deng, Kong and Bi.</p>"

630,2-s2.0-84959377761,Early silent microstructural degeneration and atrophy of the thalamocortical network in multiple sclerosis,"<p>Recent studies on patients with clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) and multiple sclerosis (MS) demonstrated thalamic atrophy. Here we addressed the following question: Is early thalamic atrophy in patients with CIS and relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) mainly a direct consequence of white matter (WM) lesions-as frequently claimed-or is the atrophy stronger correlated to ""silent"" (nonlesional) microstructural thalamic alterations? One-hundred and ten patients with RRMS, 12 with CIS, and 30 healthy controls were admitted to 3 T magnetic resonance imaging. Fractional anisotropy (FA) was computed from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to assess thalamic and WM microstructure. The relative thalamic volume (RTV) and thalamic FA were significantly reduced in patients with CIS and RRMS relative to healthy controls. Both measures were also correlated. The age, gender, WM lesion load, thalamic FA, and gray matter volume-corrected RTV were reduced even in the absence of thalamic and extensive white matter lesions-also in patients with short disease duration (≤24 months). A voxel-based correlation analysis revealed that the RTV reduction had a significant effect on local WM FA-in areas next to the thalamus and basal ganglia. These WM alterations could not be explained by WM lesions, which had a differing spatial distribution. Early thalamic atrophy is mainly driven by silent microstructural thalamic alterations. Lesions do not disclose the early damage of thalamocortical circuits, which seem to be much more affected in CIS and RRMS than expected. Thalamocortical damage can be detected by DTI in normal appearing brain tissue. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p>"
631,2-s2.0-84943752123,Gadolinium-Enhancing Lesions Lead to Decreases in White Matter Tract Fractional Anisotropy in Multiple Sclerosis,"<p>PURPOSE: Although MRI identification of new lesions forms the basis for monitoring disease progression in multiple sclerosis patients, how lesion activity relates to longitudinal white matter changes in the brain is unknown. We hypothesized that patients with gadolinium-enhancing lesions would show greater longitudinal decline in fractional anisotropy in major tracts compared to those with stable disease. METHODS: Thirty patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis were included in this study-13 had enhancing lesions at baseline and 17 did not. Each patient underwent at least two 3 Tesla contrast-enhanced MRI scans with a DTI sequence with a median interval of 2.1 years between scans. The forceps major and minor of the corpus callosum and the bilateral corticospinal tracts were selected as the major white matter tracts of interest. These tracts were reconstructed using region-of-interest placement on standard anatomical landmarks and a fiber assignment by continuous tracking algorithm using TrackVis (version 0.5.2.2) software. Mixed-effects regression models were used to determine the association between enhancing lesions and subsequent longitudinal change in fractional anisotropy. RESULTS: In patients with enhancing lesions, there was greater decline in fractional anisotropy compared to those with stable disease in the forceps major (P = .026), right corticospinal tract (P = .032), and marginally in the left corticospinal tract (P = .050), but not the forceps minor (P = .11). CONCLUSION: Fractional anisotropy of major white matter tracts declined more rapidly in patients with enhancing lesions, suggesting greater diffuse white matter injury with active inflammatory disease. DTI may provide a means of monitoring white matter injury following relapses. © 2016 American Society of Neuroimaging.</p>"
632,2-s2.0-84966286503,Atypical facial pain in multiple sclerosis caused by spinal cord seizures: A case report and review of the literature,"<p>Background: Pain is a very commonly reported symptom and often drives patients to seek medical attention; however, it can prove a very difficult diagnostic conundrum and even more challenging to treat effectively. Accurately determining the primary pain generator is key, as certain conditions have efficacious medical and surgical treatments. We present a rare case of a man with multiple sclerosis presenting with spinal cord seizures causing dermatomal pain. While pain has been reported in the context of motor symptoms attributed to spinal cord seizures in a small number of spinal cord conditions, this case represents the first report of pain exclusively associated with spinal cord demyelination in multiple sclerosis. Case presentation: We present the case of a 60-year-old Caucasian male patient with multiple sclerosis who reported a 5-year history of progressive pain in his left retroauricular region and superior left shoulder. He described this pain as sharp, episodic, and unrelenting and he was referred for consideration for surgical treatment of trigeminal neuralgia. He had no evidence of trigeminal nerve root pathology on magnetic resonance imaging, but did show dorsolateral spinal cord demyelination at the C3-4 level. His symptoms therefore represent an unusual presentation of spinal cord seizures. Conclusions: Spinal cord seizures are rarely reported in multiple sclerosis and typically present with focal motor seizures. These have been reported to present with cramping dysesthesia and pruritus, though rarely with primary pain. Knowledge of uncommon pain presentations is critical for the increasing number of primary care physicians caring for patients with such chronic neurological diseases as it will guide management and referral patterns. This knowledge is also important for the treating neurologists and neurosurgeons. Neurosurgical intervention for trigeminal neuralgia poses considerable surgical risk, and it should be avoided where possible. Identifying the primary pain generator is, therefore, critical for accurate diagnosis and management. © 2016 Gupta and Burchiel.</p>"
633,2-s2.0-84963730949,Spatio-temporal patterns of demyelination and remyelination in the cuprizone mouse model,"<p>Cuprizone administration in mice provides a reproducible model of demyelination and spontaneous remyelination, and has been useful in understanding important aspects of human disease, including multiple sclerosis. In this study, we apply high spatial resolution quantitative MRI techniques to establish the spatio-temporal patterns of acute demyelination in C57BL/6 mice after 6 weeks of cuprizone administration, and subsequent remyelination after 6 weeks of post-cuprizone recovery. MRI measurements were complemented with Black Gold II stain for myelin and immunohistochemical stains for associated tissue changes. Gene expression was evaluated using the Allen Gene Expression Atlas. Twentyfive C57BL/6 male mice were split into control and cuprizone groups; MRI data were obtained at baseline, after 6 weeks of cuprizone, and 6 weeks post-cuprizone. High-resolution (100μm isotropic) whole-brain coverage magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) parametric maps demonstrated concurrent caudal-to-rostral and medial-to-lateral gradients of MTR decrease within corpus callosum (CC) that correlated well with demyelination assessed histologically. Our results show that demyelination was not limited to the midsagittal line of the corpus callosum, and also that opposing gradients of demyelination occur in the lateral and medial CC. T2-weighted MRI gray/white matter contrast was strong at baseline, weak after 6 weeks of cuprizone treatment, and returned to a limited extent after recovery. MTR decreases during demyelination were observed throughout the brain, most clearly in callosal white matter. Myelin damage and repair appear to be influenced by proximity to oligodendrocyte progenitor cell populations and exhibit an inverse correlation with myelin basic protein gene expression. These findings suggest that susceptibility to injury and ability to repair vary across the brain, and whole-brain analysis is necessary to accurately characterize this model. Whole-brain parametric mapping across time is essential for gaining a real understanding of disease processes in-vivo. MTR increases in healthy mice throughout adolescence and adulthood were observed, illustrating the need for appropriate agematched controls. Elucidating the unique and site-specific demyelination in the cuprizone model may offer new insights into in mechanisms of both damage and repair in human demyelinating diseases. © 2016 Tagge et al.

VGM maps detect regional brain changes when comparing 2 time points on high resolution T1-weighted (T1w) magnetic resonace imaging (MRI). Two T1w MR datasets from 92 relapsing-remitting MS patients obtained 12 months apart were analysed with VGM. New lesions and volume changes of focal MS lesions as well as in the surrounding tissue were identified by visual inspection on colour coded VGM maps. Lesions were dichotomized in active and inactive lesions. Active lesions, defined by either new lesions (NL) (volume increase &gt; 5% in VGM), chronic enlarging lesions (CEL) (pre-existent T1w lesions with volume increase &gt; 5%), or chronic shrinking lesions (CSL) (pre-existent T1w lesions with volume reduction &gt; 5%) in VGM, were accompanied by tissue shrinkage in surrounding and/or functionally related regions. Volume loss within the corpus callosum was highly correlated with the number of lesions in its close proximity. Volume loss in the lateral geniculate nucleus was correlated with lesions along the optic radiation. VGM analysis provides strong evidence that all active lesion types (NL, CEL, and CSL) contribute to brain volume reduction in the vicinity of lesions and/or in anatomically and functionally related areas of the brain. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.</p>"
635,2-s2.0-84961750964,Diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging in very early onset pediatric multiple sclerosis,"<p>Objectives: Active myelination during childhood may influence the impact of multiple sclerosis (MS) on brain structural integrity. We studied normal-appearing white matter (NAWM) in children with MS onset before age 12 years using diffusion tensor (DT) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Methods: DT MRI scans were obtained from 22 MS children with their first attack before age 12 years, and 31 healthy controls from two referral centers. Using probabilistic tractography, brain tissue integrity within interhemispheric, intrahemispheric, and projection tracts was compared between patients and site-matched controls. The impact of disease and age at MRI on tract NAWM fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) values was evaluated using linear models. Results: Compared to controls, pediatric MS patients had reduced FA and increased MD of the bilateral superior longitudinal fasciculus and corpus callosum (CC), without center-by-group interaction. CC NAWM average FA was correlated with brain T2 lesion volume. In controls, the majority of the tracts analyzed showed a significant increase of FA and decrease of MD with age. Such a linear correlation was lost in patients. Conclusions: In very young pediatric MS patients, DT MRI abnormalities affect brain WM tracts differentially, and are only partially correlated with focal WM lesions. Impaired maturation of WM tracts with age may be an additional factor contributing to these findings. © SAGE Publications.</p>"
636,2-s2.0-84961174322,Absence of CCL2 and CCL3 Ameliorates Central Nervous System Grey Matter But Not White Matter Demyelination in the Presence of an Intact Blood–Brain Barrier,"<p>A broad spectrum of diseases is characterized by myelin abnormalities, oligodendrocyte pathology, and concomitant glia activation, among multiple sclerosis (MS). Our knowledge regarding the factors triggering gliosis and demyelination is scanty. Chemokines are pivotal for microglia and astrocyte activation and orchestrate critical steps during the formation of central nervous system (CNS) demyelinating lesions. Redundant functions of chemokines complicate, however, the study of their functional relevance. We used the cuprizone model to study redundant functions of two chemokines, CCL2/MCP1 and CCL3/MIP1α, which are critically involved in the pathological process of cuprizone-induced demyelination. First, we generated a mutant mouse strain lacking functional genes of both chemokines and demonstrated that double-mutant animals are viable, fertile, and do not present with gross abnormalities. Astrocytes and peritoneal macrophages, cultured form tissues of these animals did neither express CCL2 nor CCL3. Exposure to cuprizone resulted in increased CCL2 and CCL3 brain levels in wild-type but not mutant animals. Cuprizone-induced demyelination, oligodendrocyte loss, and astrogliosis were significantly ameliorated in the cortex but not corpus callosum of chemokine-deficient animals. In summary, we provide a novel powerful model to study the redundant function of two important chemokines. Our study reveals that chemokine function in the CNS redounds to region-specific pathophysiological events. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.</p>"
637,2-s2.0-84960154306,Enhanced mirror activity in 'crossed' reaction time tasks in multiple sclerosis,"<p>Objective: Execution of unimanual voluntary motor tasks requires appropriate inhibitory control over contralateral motor output. Such inhibition should involve interhemispheric connections, which are often damaged in multiple sclerosis (MS). Methods: Twenty mildly-disabled MS patients and 13 healthy subjects performed ipsilateral and contralateral wrist-extension reactions (IR and CR, respectively) to a unilateral somatosensory cue, the latter condition requiring necessarily interhemispheric transfer of information. Prevalence, persistence, latency and amount of mirror electromyographic activity (mEMG) were calculated in each study group, as well as diffusion-tensor-imaging measures of damage in corpus callosum and brainstem for correlation with mEMG. Results: Healthy subjects and patients showed mEMG more often in CR than in IR. In CR tasks, mEMG was larger, more persistent and occurred more often at a shorter latency with respect to voluntary reaction in patients than in healthy subjects (p &lt; 0.05 for all). Patients with mEMG had significantly higher diffusivity values of damage in corpus callosum and lower brainstem volumes than patients without mEMG (p &lt; 0.05 for all). Conclusions: MS patients show deficient inhibition of unintended mEMG in 'crossed' reaction time tasks. Significance: Enhanced mEMG in MS may be due to microstructural axonal damage and atrophy in inhibitory commissural connections of the corpus callosum and brainstem. © 2016 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.</p>"
638,2-s2.0-84958748770,S1P<inf>1</inf> deletion in oligodendroglial lineage cells: Effect on differentiation and myelination,"<p>Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) receptors are G protein-coupled receptors expressed by many cell types, including cells of oligodendrocyte (OLG) lineage. We had previously shown that targeted deletion of S1P<sub>1</sub> in OLG lineage cells did not result in obvious clinical phenotype or altered number of OLGs at 3 months, but there were subtle abnormalities in myelin. In this study, we examined the role of S1P<sub>1</sub> in developmental myelination and cell survival, focusing on age 3 weeks. We found that S1P<sub>1</sub> deficiency led to delayed differentiation of OLG progenitors (OPCs) into OLGs that is independent of p38 phosphorylation. This was accompanied by decreased levels of myelin basic protein (MBP) but not of myelin-OLG glycoprotein (MOG), and slight decrease in myelin thickness in the corpus callosum of S1P<sub>1</sub> conditional knockout (CKO) mice. S1P<sub>1</sub>-deficient OLGs exhibited slower process extension, which was associated with attenuated phosphorylation of extracellular signal regulated kinases (ERKs) and p21-activated kinases (PAKs), and with upregulation of tropomodulin1. Basal levels of pAkt were not affected, though expectedly, no response to a selective S1P<sub>1</sub> agonist SEW2871 was observed. S1P<sub>1</sub>-deficient OLGs did not exhibit increased cell death in response to cuprizone, tumor necrosis factor-α, or deprivation of nutrients and growth factors. We conclude that S1P<sub>1</sub> signaling regulates OLG development, morphological maturation and early myelination. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p>"
639,2-s2.0-84954420276,Thymosin beta4 promotes oligodendrogenesis in the demyelinating central nervous system,"<p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS). No effective remyelination therapies are in use. We hypothesized that thymosin beta4 (Tβ4) is an effective remyelination treatment by promoting differentiation of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs), and that the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling pathway contributes to this process. Two demyelination animal models were employed in this study: 1) experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of MS. EAE mice were treated daily for 30days, with Tβ4 or saline treatment initiated on the day of EAE onset; and 2) cuprizone diet model, a non-inflammatory demyelination model. The mice were treated daily for 4weeks with Tβ4 or saline after fed a cuprizone diet for 5weeks. Immunofluorescent staining and Western blot were performed to measure the differentiation of OPCs, myelin and axons, respectively. To obtain insight into mechanisms of action, the expression and activation of the EGFR pathway was measured. AG1478, an EGFR inhibitor, was employed in a loss-of-function study. Data revealed that animals in both demyelination models exhibited significant reduction of myelin basic protein (MBP<sup>+</sup>) levels and CNPase<sup>+</sup> oligodendrocytes. Treatment of EAE mice with Tβ4 significantly improved neurological outcome. Double immunofluorescent staining showed that Tβ4 significantly increased the number of newly generated oligodendrocytes identified by BrdU<sup>+</sup>/CNPase<sup>+</sup> cells and MBP<sup>+</sup> mature oligodendrocytes, and reduced axonal damage in the EAE mice compared with the saline treatment. The newly generated mature oligodendrocytes remyelinated axons, and the increased mature oligodendrocytes significantly correlated with functional improvement (r=0.73, p&lt;0.05). Western blot analysis revealed that Tβ4 treatment increased expression and activation of the EGFR pathway. In the cuprizone demyelination model, Tβ4 treatment was confirmed that significantly increased OPC differentiation and remyelination, and increased the expression of EGFR and activated the EGFR pathway in the demyelinating corpus callosum. In cultured OPCs, blockage of the activation of the EGFR pathway with AG1478 abolished the Tβ4-increased OPC differentiation. Collectively, these findings indicate that: 1) Tβ4 increases proliferation of OPCs and the maturation of OPCs to myelinating oligodendrocytes which in concert, likely contribute to the beneficial effect of Tβ4 on EAE, 2) EGFR upregulated and activated by Tβ4 may mediate the process of OPC differentiation, and 3) Tβ4 could potentially be developed as a therapy for MS patients, and for other demyelinating neurological disorders. © 2016.</p>"
640,2-s2.0-84962233313,Susac Syndrome: A Diagnostic Chameleon,"<p>Susac's syndrome (SuS) is a rare, probably autoimmune endotheliopathy of the central nervous system, retina and inner ear. It is characterized by a clinical triad of encephalopathy, branch retinal artery occlusions (BRAOs) and sensorineural hearing loss. To date, more than 300 cases of SuS have been reported in the literature. However, SuS remains an under- and misdiagnosed entity in the clinical setting. This report presents an exemplary case of a patient, who was initially misdiagnosed with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. At initial presentation, the patient did not demonstrate the complete clinical triad, and the interval between symptom onset and diagnosis was 4 months. Typical diagnostic features, which enabled the diagnosis of SuS were: a) MRI findings with T2-hyperintense snowball-like lesions of the corpus callosum and subcortical white matter and hyperintense lesions in diffusion-weighted imaging with reduced apparent diffusion coefficient; b) BRAOs and vessel wall hyperfluorescence in fluorescein angiography and a significant thickness reduction of the inner retinal layers in optical coherence tomography; c) bilateral sensorineural hearing loss. The patient was aggressively treated with cyclophosphamide, rituximab, glucocorticoids and acetylsalicylic acid with a good response to therapy. This report draws attention to the need to take SuS into consideration in the differential diagnosis at the interface of neurological, psychiatric, ophthalmological and otorhinolaryngological disorders. As SuS may result in severe and persistent neurological deficits, an interdisciplinary collaboration is fundamental for the prompt diagnosis and initiation of adequate immunosuppressive treatment. © Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart - New York.</p>"
641,2-s2.0-84962106749,Heterogeneity of multiple sclerosis lesions in multislice myelin water imaging,"<p>Purpose: To assess neuroprotection and remyelination in Multiple Sclerosis (MS), we applied a more robust myelin water imaging (MWI) processing technique, including spatial priors into image reconstruction, which allows for lower SNR, less averages and shorter acquisition times. We sought to evaluate this technique in MS-patients and healthy controls (HC). Materials and Methods: Seventeen MS-patients and 14 age-matched HCs received a 3T Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) examination including MWI (8 slices, 12 minutes acquisition time), T2w and T1mprage pre and post gadolinium (GD) administration. Black holes (BH), contrast enhancing lesions (CEL) and T2 lesions were marked and registered to MWI. Additionally, regions of interest (ROI) were defined in the frontal, parietal and occipital normal appearing white matter (NAWM)/white matter (WM), the corticospinal tract (CST), the splenium (SCC) and genu (GCC) of the corpus callosum in patients and HCs. Mean values of myelin water fraction (MWF) were determined for each ROI. Results: Significant differences (p&lt;0.05) of the MWF were found in all three different MS-lesion types (BH, CEL, T2 lesions), compared to the WM of HCs. The mean MWF values among the different lesion types were significantly differing from each other. Comparing MS-patients vs. HCs, we found a significant (p&lt;0.05) difference of the MWF in all measured ROIs except of GCC and SCC. The mean reduction of MWF in the NAWM of MS-patients compared to HCs was 37%. No age, sex, disability score and disease duration dependency was found for the NAWM MWF. Conclusion: MWF measures were in line with previous studies and lesions were clearly visible in MWI. MWI allows for quantitative assessment of NAWM and lesions in MS, which could be used as an additional sensitive imaging endpoint for larger MS studies. Measurements of the MWF also differ between patients and healthy controls. © 2016 Faizy et al.

Therefore, the search for new MS treatments remains very important. This study was performed on a commonly used cuprizone animal model of multiple sclerosis. It evaluated the effect of a plant-derived substance called Ropren® (containing approximately 95% polyprenols or long-chain isoprenoid alcohols) on cuprizone- induced demyelination. The study was performed on 27 eight-week old male CD-1 mice. To induce demyelination mice were fed 0.5% cuprizone in the standard diet for 10 weeks. Ropren® was administered in one daily intraperitoneal injection (12mg/kg), beginning on the 6<sup>th</sup> week of the experiment. On the 11<sup>th</sup> week, the corpus callosum in the brain was evaluated in all animals using magnetic resonance imaging with an 11.7 T animal scanner using T2- weighted sequence. Cuprizone treatment successfully induced the model of demyelination with a significant decrease in the size of the corpus callosum compared with the control group (p&lt;0.01). Mice treated with both cuprizone and Ropren® did not exhibit demyelination in the corpus callosum (p&lt;0.01). This shows the positive effect of polyprenols on cuprizone-induced demyelination in mice.</p>"

645,2-s2.0-84958043317,"Scutellarin Alleviates Behavioral Deficits in a Mouse Model of Multiple Sclerosis, Possibly Through Protecting Neural Stem Cells","<p>Scutellarin, a flavonoid extracted from an herbal medication (Erigeron breviscapus Hand-Mazz), has been shown to protect neurons against damage and to promote neurogenesis, and thus has therapeutic potential in the treatment of a variety of neurodegenerative diseases. Since neural stem cells (NSCs) could differentiate into myelin-producing oligodendrocytes, we speculate that scutellarin could also be used to treat multiple sclerosis (MS). In the current study, we examined potential effects of scutellarin using a mouse model of MS. Briefly, adult C57BL/6 mice exposed to cuprizone (8 mg/day through diet, for 6 consecutive weeks) randomly received scutellarin (50 mg/kg/day) or vehicle for 10 consecutive days. In the scutellarin-treated group, rotarod testing at the end of the treatment showed significant improvement of motor function (increased time to fall); myelin basic protein (MBP) staining of the corpus callosum revealed decreased demyelination; TUNEL staining followed by Nestin or Sox2 staining revealed increased number of NSCs and decreased rate of NSC apoptosis in the subventricular zone (SVZ) of the lateral ventricles (LV). In a series of experiments using cultured NSCs subjected to cuprizone injury, we confirmed the protective effects of scutellarin. At 30 μM, scutellarin increased the commitment of NSCs to the oligodendrocyte and neuronal lineages, as evidenced by NG2 chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (NG2) and doublecortin (DCX) staining. Differentiation into astrocytes (as revealed by glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) staining) was decreased. Maturation of the NSCs committed to the oligodendrocyte lineage, as evidenced by oligodendrocyte marker O4 antibody (O4) staining and MBP staining, was also promoted by scutellarin. Further analysis revealed that scutellarin might suppress the phosphorylation of p38 in cuprizone-induced NSCs. In summary, scutellarin could alleviate motor deficits in a mouse model for MS, possibly by inhibiting NSC apoptosis and promoting differentiation of NSCs to myelin-producing oligodendrocytes. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.</p>"

Methods: Serum samples collected from 74 children with suspected demyelinating disorders whom were being followed at Massachusetts General Hospital were incubated with control green fluorescent protein (GFP)- and MOG-GFP-transfected Jurkat cell clones. The binding ratios were calculated using flow cytometry. Using statistical analyses, we compared the demographic, clinical and radiological features in our seropositive and seronegative patients. Results: We found that 13 out of 74 (17.5%) patients were seropositive for MOG. The MOG-seropositive patients were younger than the seronegative patients (p = 0.049). No single disease category predominated among the seropositive patients, nor was one group more likely to have a polyphasic course. There were two out of four neuromyelitis optica (NMO) patients who had MOG antibodies; both were seronegative for aquaporin -4 (AQP4) antibodies. One had monophasic disease and the other had frequent relapses. There was a bimodal distribution of the MOG-seropositive patients by age at onset, with a distinct younger group (4-8 years) having a high prevalence of encephalopathy and an older group (13-18 years), whom presented almost exclusively with optic neuritis. MRI analysis demonstrated the absence of corpus callosum lesions in the seropositive patients (p = 0.012). The annualized relapse rate (ARR) and the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) results at 2 years did not differ between the seropositive and seronegative patients.

Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) provide sensitive and complementary measures of the neural tissue microstructure. Additionally, specific white matter tract integrity (WMTI) metrics modelling the diffusion in white matter were recently derived. In the current study we used the well-characterized cuprizone mouse model of central nervous system demyelination to assess the temporal evolution of diffusion tensor (DT), diffusion kurtosis tensor (DK) and WMTI-derived metrics following acute inflammatory demyelination and spontaneous remyelination.While DT-derived metrics were unable to detect cuprizone induced cortical alterations, the mean kurtosis (MK) and radial kurtosis (RK) were found decreased under cuprizone administration, as compared to age-matched controls, in both the motor and somatosensory cortices. The MK remained decreased in the motor cortices at the end of the recovery period, reflecting long lasting impairment of myelination.In white matter, DT, DK and WMTI-derived metrics enabled the detection of cuprizone induced changes differentially according to the stage and the severity of the lesion. More specifically, the MK, the RK and the axonal water fraction (AWF) were the most sensitive for the detection of cuprizone induced changes in the genu of the corpus callosum, a region less affected by cuprizone administration. Additionally, microgliosis was associated with an increase of MK and RK during the acute inflammatory demyelination phase. In regions undergoing severe demyelination, namely the body and splenium of the corpus callosum, DT-derived metrics, notably the mean diffusion (MD) and radial diffusion (RD), were among the best discriminators between cuprizone and control groups, hence highlighting their ability to detect both acute and long lasting changes. Interestingly, WMTI-derived metrics showed the aptitude to distinguish between the different stages of the disease. Both the intra-axonal diffusivity (D<sub>a</sub>) and the AWF were found to be decreased in the cuprizone treated group, D<sub>a</sub> specifically decreased during the acute inflammatory demyelinating phase whereas the AWF decrease was associated to the spontaneous remyelination and the recovery period.Altogether our results demonstrate that DKI is sensitive to alterations of cortical areas and provides, along with WMTI metrics, information that is complementary to DT-derived metrics for the characterization of demyelination in both white and grey matter and subsequent inflammatory processes associated with a demyelinating event. © 2015 Published by Elsevier Inc.</p>"

Methods: Forty-seven patients with early PPMS and 18 healthy controls had conventional and magnetization transfer imaging at baseline; a subgroup of 35 patients repeated the protocol after 2 years. Masks of the corticospinal tracts, genu of the corpus callosum and optic radiations, and of connected cortical regions, were used for extracting the mean magnetization transfer ratio (MTR). Multiple regressions within each of 5 tract-cortex pairs were performed, adjusting for the dependent variable's baseline MTR; tract lesion load and MTR, spinal cord area, age, and sex were examined for potential confounding. Results: The baseline MTR of most regions was lower in patients than in healthy controls. The tract-cortex pair relationships in the primary WM damage model were significant for the bilateral motor pair and right visual pair, while those in the primary GM damage model were only significant for the right motor pair. Lower lesion MTR at baseline was associated with lower MTR in the same tract normal-appearing WM at 2 years in 3 tracts. Conclusion: These results are consistent with the hypothesis that in early PPMS, cortical damage is for the most part a sequela of normal-appearing WM pathology, which, in turn, is predicted by abnormalities within WM lesions. © 2015 American Academy of Neurology.</p>"
651,2-s2.0-84953439274,Post-CNS-inflammation expression of CXCL12 promotes the endogenous myelin/neuronal repair capacity following spontaneous recovery from multiple sclerosis-like disease,"<p>Background: Demyelination and axonal degeneration, hallmarks of multiple sclerosis (MS), are associated with the central nervous system (CNS) inflammation facilitated by C-X-C motif chemokine 12 (CXCL12) chemokine. Both in MS and in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), the deleterious CNS inflammation has been associated with upregulation of CXCL12 expression in the CNS. We investigated the expression dynamics of CXCL12 in the CNS with progression of clinical EAE and following spontaneous recovery, with a focus on CXCL12 expression in the hippocampal neurogenic dentate gyrus (DG) and in the corpus callosum (CC) of spontaneously recovered mice, and its potential role in promoting the endogenous myelin/neuronal repair capacity. Methods: CNS tissue sections from mice with different clinical EAE phases or following spontaneous recovery and in vitro differentiated adult neural stem cell cultures were analyzed by immunofluorescent staining and confocal imaging for detecting and enumerating neuronal progenitor cells (NPCs) and oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) and for expression of CXCL12. Results: Our expression dynamics analysis of CXCL12 in the CNS with EAE progression revealed elevated CXCL12 expression in the DG and CC, which persistently increases following spontaneous recovery even though CNS inflammation has subsided. Correspondingly, the numbers of NPCs and OPCs in the DG and CC, respectively, of EAE-recovered mice increased compared to that of naïve mice (NPCs, p &lt; 0.0001; OPCs, p &lt; 0.00001) or mice with active disease (OPCs, p &lt; 0.0005). Notably, about 30 % of the NPCs and unexpectedly also OPCs (~50 %) express CXCL12, and their numbers in DG and CC, respectively, are higher in EAE-recovered mice compared with naïve mice and also compared with mice with ongoing clinical EAE (CXCL12<sup>+</sup> NPCs, p &lt; 0.005; CXCL12<sup>+</sup> OPCs, p &lt; 0.0005). Moreover, a significant proportion (&gt;20 %) of the CXCL12<sup>+</sup> NPCs and OPCs co-express the CXCL12 receptor, CXCR4, and their numbers significantly increase with recovery from EAE not only relative to naïve mice (p &lt; 0.0002) but also to mice with ongoing EAE (p &lt; 0.004). Conclusions: These data link CXCL12 expression in the DG and CC of EAE-recovering mice to the promotion of neuro/oligodendrogenesis generating CXCR4<sup>+</sup> CXCL12<sup>+</sup> neuronal and oligodendrocyte progenitor cells endowed with intrinsic neuro/oligondendroglial differentiation potential. These findings highlight the post-CNS-inflammation role of CXCL12 in augmenting the endogenous myelin/neuronal repair capacity in MS-like disease, likely via CXCL12/CXCR4 autocrine signaling. © 2016 Zilkha-Falb et al.</p>"
652,2-s2.0-84954046363,Alterations in functional and structural connectivity in pediatric-onset multiple sclerosis,"<p>Background Reduced white matter (WM) integrity is a fundamental aspect of pediatric multiple sclerosis (MS), though relations to resting-state functional MRI (fMRI) connectivity remain unknown. The objective of this study was to relate diffusion-tensor imaging (DTI) measures ofWM microstructural integrity to resting-state network (RSN) functional connectivity in pediatriconset MS to test the hypothesis that abnormalities in RSN reflects changes in structural integrity. Methods This study enrolled 19 patients with pediatric-onset MS (mean age = 19, range 13-24 years, 14 female, mean disease duration = 65 months, mean age of disease onset = 13 years) and 16 age- and sex-matched healthy controls (HC). All subjects underwent 3.0T anatomical and functional MRI which included DTI and resting-state acquisitions. DTI processing was performed using Tract-Based Spatial Statistics (TBSS). RSNs were identified using Independent Components Analysis, and a dual regression technique was used to detect between-group differences in the functional connectivity of RSNs. Correlations were investigated between DTI measures and RSN connectivity. Results Lower fractional anisotropy (FA) was observed in the pediatric-onset MS group compared to HC group within the entire WM skeleton, and particularly the corpus callosum, posterior thalamic radiation, corona radiata and sagittal stratum (all p &lt; .01, corrected). Relative to HCs, MS patients showed higher functional connectivity involving the anterior cingulate cortex and right precuneus of the default-mode network, as well as involving the anterior cingulate cortex and left middle frontal gyrus of the frontoparietal network (all p &lt; .005 uncorrected, k≥30 voxels). Higher functional connectivity of the right precuneus within the default-mode network was associated with lower FA of the entire WM skeleton (r = -.525, p = .02), genu of the corpus callosum (r = -.553, p = .014), and left (r = -.467, p = .044) and right (r = -.615, p = .005) sagittal stratum. © Akbar et al.This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.</p>"

Clinically, RESLES is defined as reversible isolated splenial lesions in the corpus callosum, which can be readily identified by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and usually resolve completely over a period of time. RESLES could be typically triggered by infection, antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), poisoning, etc. More factors are increasingly recognized. Methods and results: We reported herein an 18-year-old female patient with lobar pneumonia who developed mental abnormalities during hospitalization. An isolated splenial lesion in the corpus callosum was found by head MRI and the lesion disappeared 15 days later. Based on her clinical manifestations and radiological findings, she was diagnosed with lobar pneumonia associated RESLES. We further summarize the up-to-date knowledge about the etiology, possible pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, radiological features, treatment, and prognosis of RESLES. Conclusion: This report contributes to the clinical understanding of RESLES which may present with mental abnormalities after infection. The characteristic imaging of reversible isolated splenial lesions in the corpus callosum was confirmed in this report. The clinical manifestations and lesions on MRI could disappear naturally after 1 month without special treatment. Copyright © 2016 the Author(s). Published by Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

However, the efficacy of EA has not been examined in neuro-inflammatory conditions. Microglia making the innate immune system of the central nervous system (CNS) and are imperative cellular mediators of neuro-inflammatory processes. In this study, neuro-protective effects of EA on cuprizone (Cup)-induced acute CNS inflammation evaluated. C57BL/6J mice were fed with chow containing 0.2 % Cup for 3 weeks to induce acute neuro-inflammation predominantly in the corpus callosum (CC). EA was administered at different doses (40 or 80 mg/kg body weight/day/i.p) from the first day of the Cup diet. Microglia activation (microgliosis) and expression of microglia related chemokines during Cup challenge were examined. Results shows that EA significantly decreased the number of activated microglia cells (Iba-1+ cells) and also restricted proliferation of these cell population (Iba-1+/Ki67+ cells) in dose dependent manner. Consequently, concentration of microglial pro-inflammatory chemokines including monocyte chemoattractant protein-1/Chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (MCP-1/CCL2), and macrophage inflammatory protein 1-alpha/Chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 3 (MIP-1-a/CCL3) dramatically reduced in CC after EA treatment. According to this results, we conclude that EA is a suitable therapeutic agent for moderation brain damages in neuro-inflammatory diseases. © 2016 by the C.M.B. Association. All rights reserved.</p>"
656,2-s2.0-84996538491,Corpus callosum segmentation in brain MRIs via robust target-localization and joint supervised feature extraction and prediction,"<p>Accurate segmentation of the mid-sagittal corpus callosum as captured in magnetic resonance images is an important step in many clinical research studies for various neurological disorders. This task can be challenging,however,especially more so in clinical studies,like those acquired of multiple sclerosis patients,whose brain structures may have undergone significant changes,rendering accurate registrations and hence,(multi-) atlas-based segmentation algorithms inapplicable. Furthermore,the MRI scans to be segmented often vary significantly in terms of image quality,rendering many generic unsupervised segmentation methods insufficient,as demonstrated in a recent work. In this paper,we hypothesize that adopting a supervised approach to the segmentation task may bring a break-through to performance. By employing a discriminative learning framework,our method automatically learns a set of latent features useful for identifying the target structure that proved to generalize well across various datasets,as our experiments demonstrate. Our evaluations,as conducted on four large datasets collected from different sources,totaling 2,033 scans,demonstrates that our method achieves an average Dice similarity score of 0.93 on test sets,when the models were trained on at most 300 images,while the top-performing unsupervised method could only achieve an average Dice score of 0.77. © Springer International Publishing AG 2016.</p>"
657,2-s2.0-84993927179,Reliability of measuring regional callosal atrophy in neurodegenerative diseases,"<p>The Corpus Callosum (CC) is an important structure connecting the two brain hemispheres. As several neurodegenerative diseases are known to alter its shape, it is an interesting structure to assess as biomarker. Yet, currently, the CC-segmentation is often performed manually and is consequently an error prone and time-demanding procedure. In this paper, we present an accurate and automated method for corpus callosum segmentation based on T1-weighted MRI images. After the initial construction of a CC atlas based on healthy controls, a new image is subjected to a mid-sagittal plane (MSP) detection algorithm and a 3D affine registration in order to initialise the CC within the extracted MSP. Next, an active shape model is run to extract the CC. We calculated the reliability of most popular CC features (area, circularity, corpus callosum index and thickness profile) in healthy controls, Alzheimer's Disease patients and Multiple Sclerosis patients. Importantly, we also provide inter-scanner reliability estimates. We obtained an intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) of over 0.95 for most features and most datasets. The inter-scanner reliability assessed on the MS patients was remarkably well and ranged from 0.77 to 0.97. In summary, we have constructed an algorithm that reliably detects the CC in 3D T1 images in a fully automated way in healthy controls and different neurodegenerative diseases. Although the CC area and the circularity are the most reliable features (ICC &gt; 0.97); the reliability of the thickness profile (ICC &gt; 0.90; excluding the tip) is sufficient to warrant its inclusion in future clinical studies. © 2016 The Author(s)</p>"
658,2-s2.0-84988405263,"A challenging diagnosis of late-onset tumefactive multiple sclerosis associated to cervicodorsal syringomyelia: Doubtful CT, MRI, and bioptic findings Case report and literature review","<p>Background: Tumefactive multiple sclerosis (MS) is an unusual variant of demyelinating disease characterized by lesions with pseudotumoral appearance on radiological imaging mimicking other space-occupying lesions, such as neoplasms, infections, and infarction. Especially when the patient's medical history is incompatible with MS, the differential diagnosis between these lesions constitutes a diagnostic challenge often requiring histological investigation. An older age at onset makes distinguishing tumefactive demyelinating lesion (TDL) from tumors even more challenging. Methods:We report a case of brain TDL as the initial manifestation of late-onset MS associated with cervico-dorsal syringomyelia. A 66-year-old Caucasian woman with a 15-day history headache was referred to our hospital because of the acute onset of paraphasia. She suffered from noncommunicating syringomyelia associated to basilar impression and she reported a 10-year history of burning dysesthesia of the left side of the chest extended to the internipple line level. Results: Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examinations revealed a left frontal lesion with features suspicious for a tumor. Given the degree of overlap with other pathologic processes, CT and MRI findings failed to provide an unambiguous diagnosis; furthermore, because of the negative cerebrospinal fluid analysis for oligoclonal bands, the absence of other lesions, and the heightened suspicion of neoplasia, the clinicians opted to perform a stereotactic biopsy. Brain specimen analysis did not exclude the possibility of perilesional reactive gliosis and the patient, receiving anitiedemigen therapy, was monthly followed up. In the meanwhile, the second histological opinion of the brain specimen described the absence of pleomorphic glial cells indicating a tumor. These findings were interpreted as destructive inflammatory demyelinating disease and according to the evolution of MRI lesion burden, MS was diagnosed. Conclusion: TDL still remains a problematic entity clinically, radiologically, and sometimes even pathologically. A staged follow-up is necessary, and in our case, it revealed to be the most important attitude to define the nature of the lesion, confirming the classic MS diagnostic criteria of disseminate lesions in time and space. We discuss our findings according to the recent literature. Copyright © 2016 the Author(s). Published by Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All.</p>"

Axon diameters vary, even within a fiber bundle, and are not normally distributed. An accurate distribution function is therefore beneficial, either to describe axon diameters that are obtained from a direct measurement technique (e.g., microscopy), or to infer them indirectly (e.g., using diffusion-weighted MRI). The gamma distribution is a common choice for this purpose (particularly for the inferential approach) because it resembles the distribution profile of measured axon diameters which has been consistently shown to be non-negative and right-skewed. In this study we compared a wide range of parametric probability distribution functions against empirical data obtained from electron microscopy images.We observed that the gamma distribution fails to accurately describe the main characteristics of the axon diameter distribution, such as location and scale of the mode and the profile of distribution tails. We also found that the generalized extreme value distribution consistently fitted the measured distribution better than other distribution functions. This suggests that there may be distinct subpopulations of axons in the corpus callosum, each with their own distribution profiles. In addition, we observed that several other distributions outperformed the gamma distribution, yet had the same number of unknown parameters; these were the inverse Gaussian, log normal, log logistic and Birnbaum-Saunders distributions. © 2016 Sepehrband, Alexander, Clark, Kurniawan, Yang and Reutens.</p>"
661,2-s2.0-84968853419,Pericallosal lipomas: A series of 10 cases with clinical and radiological features,"<p>Aim: A pericallosal lipoma is a fat-containing lesion occurring in the interhemispheric fissure closely related to the corpus callosum, which is often abnormal. This is the most common location for an intracranial lipoma. In this study, we aim to report on the clinical and radiographic aspects of ten patients diagnosed with pericallosal lipomas. Material and Methods: A retrospective analysis of patients who presented to the neurology and neurosurgery outpatient clinics of Kayseri Training and Research Hospital between 2010 and 2014 revealed that 10 patients had the diagnosis of pericallosal lipoma. The clinical and magnetic resonance imaging data were obtained by reviewing their files. Results: Ten patients with an average age of 35.8 years (11-80 years) were included in the study. The mean follow-up was 17 months (8-31 months). No neurological deficits related to the lesions were found during neurological examination in any of the patients. Four patients had tubulonodular lipomas while the other 6 presented with curvilinear lipomas. Four patients (40%) displayed a coexistent corpus callosum hypoplasia. In contrast to previous reports, 3 of these patients had a curvilinear lipoma while the remaining one had tubulonodular lipoma. Also, one of the patients displayed plaque lesions attributable to multiple sclerosis. During the follow-up period, no growth in the lipomas was recorded in any of the patients. No surgical intervention was performed as none of the patients displayed symptoms caused by the lipoma. Conclusion: In this study, we found a stronger association of corpus callosum hypoplasia with posteriorly situated curvilinear lipomas. Our results are in disagreement with previous studies, which suggested corpus callosum anomalies were more often associated with anteriorly situated tubulonodular lipomas. Pericallosal lipomas are benign, self-limiting or slow-growing lesions that generally remain asymptomatic. These lesions occur in the midline and surround critical neurovascular structures. Therefore, surgical intervention should be avoided in asymptomatic cases.</p>"
662,2-s2.0-84962432239,Histopathological comparison of Kearns-Sayre syndrome and PGC-1α-deficient mice suggests a novel concept for vacuole formation in mitochondrial encephalopathy,"<p>Despite the current hypotheses about myelinic and astrocytic ion-dyshomeostasis underlying white (WM) and grey matter (GM) vacuolation in mitochondrial encephalopathies, there is a paucity of data on the exact mechanism of vacuole formation. To revisit the concepts of vacuole formation associated with mitochondrial dysfunction, we performed a comparative neuropathological analysis in Kearns-Sayre syndrome (KSS) and full-length peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-g coactivator-1α (FL-PGC-1α)-deficient mice, a recently proposed morphological model of mitochondrial encephalopathies. Brain tissues from an individual with genetically proven KSS (22-year-old man) and aged FL-PGC-1α-deficient and wild-type (male, 70-75-week-old) mice were analysed using ultrastructural and immunohistochemical methods, with a specific focus on myelin-related, oligodendroglial, axonal and astrocytic pathologies. Besides demonstrating remarkable similarities in the lesion profile of KSS and FL-PGC-1α-deficient mice, this study first provides morphological evidence for the identical origin of WM and GM vacuolation as well as for the presence of intracytoplasmic oligodendroglial vacuoles in mitochondriopathies. Based on these observations, the paper proposes a theoretical model for the development of focal myelin vacuolation as opposed to the original concepts of intramyelin oedema. Placing oligodendrocytes in the centre of tissue lesioning in conditions related to defects in mitochondria, our observations support the rationale for cytoprotective targeting of oligodendrocytes in mitochondrial encephalopathies, and may also have implications in brain aging and multiple sclerosis, as discussed.</p>"
663,2-s2.0-84957091461,Directed differentiation of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells from mouse induced pluripotent stem cells,"<p>Several neurological disorders, such as multiple sclerosis, the leukodystrophies, and traumatic injury, result in loss of myelin in the central nervous system (CNS). These disorders may benefit from cell-based therapies that prevent further demyelination or are able to restore lost myelin. One potential therapeutic strategy for these disorders is the manufacture of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) by the directed differentiation of pluripotent stem cells, including induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). It has been proposed that OPCs could be transplanted into demyelinated or dysmyelinated regions of the CNS, where they would migrate to the area of injury before terminally differentiating into myelinating oligodendrocytes. OPCs derived from mouse iPSCs are particularly useful for modeling this therapeutic approach and for studying the biology of oligodendrocyte progenitors because of the availability of mouse models of neurological disorders associated with myelin deficiency. Moreover, the utility of miPSC-derived OPCs would be significantly enhanced by the adoption of a consistent, reproducible differentiation protocol that allows OPCs derived from different cell lines to be robustly characterized and compared. Here we describe a standardized, defined protocol that reliably directs the differentiation of miPSCs to generate high yields of OPCs that are capable of maturing into oligodendrocytes. © 2016 Cognizant, LLC.</p>"
664,2-s2.0-84955177956,On the relation between self-reported cognitive fatigue and the posterior hypothalamic-brainstem network,"<p>Background and Purpose: Various causes have been suggested for multiple sclerosis (MS) related fatigue. Hypothalamus-brainstem fibres play a role in sleep-wake regulation and in hypothalamic deactivation during inflammatory states. Hence, they may play a role for experiencing fatigue by changing bottom-up hypothalamic activation. Methods: Multiple sclerosis patients with and without self-reported cognitive fatigue and healthy controls were analysed with respect to the integrity of hypothalamus-brainstem fibres using diffusion-tensor imaging based tractography, focusing on the anterior, medial and posterior hypothalamic areas, controlling for clinical impairment and excluding participants with depressive mood. Results: Multiple sclerosis patients without self-reported cognitive fatigue showed increased axial and radial diffusivity levels specifically for fibres connecting the right posterior hypothalamus with the right locus coeruleus, but not for the medial hypothalamus and the corpus callosum. Moreover, there were no differences between MS patients with and without fatigue in brain atrophy and lesion load, which could explain our results. Conclusion: Multiple sclerosis patients not experiencing fatigue show increased axial and radial diffusivity for fibres connecting the posterior hypothalamus and the brainstem, which might prevent bottom-up activation of the posterior hypothalamus and therefore downregulation of structures responsible for wakefulness and exploratory states of mind. © 2016 European Academy of Neurology.</p>"
665,2-s2.0-84954365835,Loss of galectin-3 decreases the number of immune cells in the subventricular zone and restores proliferation in a viral model of multiple sclerosis,"<p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) frequently starts near the lateral ventricles, which are lined by subventricular zone (SVZ) progenitor cells that can migrate to lesions and contribute to repair. Because MS-induced inflammation may decrease SVZ proliferation and thus limit repair, we studied the role of galectin-3 (Gal-3), a proinflammatory protein. Gal-3 expression was increased in periventricular regions of human MS in post-mortem brain samples and was also upregulated in periventricular regions in a murine MS model, Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) infection. Whereas TMEV increased SVZ chemokine (CCL2, CCL5, CCL, and CXCL10) expression in wild type (WT) mice, this was inhibited in Gal-3<sup>-/-</sup> mice. Though numerous CD45+ immune cells entered the SVZ of WT mice after TMEV infection, their numbers were significantly diminished in Gal-3<sup>-/-</sup> mice. TMEV also reduced neuroblast and proliferative SVZ cell numbers in WT mice but this was restored in Gal-3<sup>-/-</sup> mice and was correlated with increased numbers of doublecortin+ neuroblasts in the corpus callosum. In summary, our data showed that loss of Gal-3 blocked chemokine increases after TMEV, reduced immune cell migration into the SVZ, reestablished SVZ proliferation and increased the number of progenitors in the corpus callosum. These results suggest Gal-3 plays a central role in modulating the SVZ neurogenic niche's response to this model of MS. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p>"

Enhancing myelin repair by stimulating endogenous progenitors is a main goal in efforts for MS treatment. Fingolimod (FTY720) which is administrated as an oral medicine for relapsing-remitting MS has direct effects on neural cells. In this study, we hypothesized if daily treatment with FTY720 enhances endogenous myelin repair in a model of local demyelination induced by lysolecithin (LPC). We examined the response of inflammatory cells as well as resident OPCs and evaluated the number of newly produced myelinating cells in animals which were under daily treatment with FTY720. FTY720 at doses 0.3 and 1. mg/kg decreased the inflammation score at the site of LPC injection and decreased the extent of demyelination. FTY720 especially at the lower dose increased the number of remyelinated axons and newly produced myelinating cells. These data indicate that repetitive treatment with FTY720, behind an anti-inflammatory effect, exerts beneficial effects on the process of endogenous repair of demyelinating insults. © 2015 IBRO.</p>"
667,2-s2.0-84924425624,Gain of Olig2 function in oligodendrocyte progenitors promotes remyelination,"<p>The basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor Olig2 is a key determinant for the specification of neural precursor cells into oligodendrocyte progenitor cells. However, the functional role of Olig2 in oligodendrocyte migration and differentiation remains elusive both during developmental myelination and under demyelinating conditions of the adult central nervous system. To decipher Olig2 functions, we generated transgenic mice (TetOlig2:Sox10<sup>rtTA/+</sup>) overexpressing Olig2 in Sox10<sup>+</sup> oligodendroglial cells in a doxycycline inducible manner. We show that Olig2 overexpression increases the generation of differentiated oligodendrocytes, leading to precocious myelination of the central nervous system. Unexpectedly, we found that gain of Olig2 function in oligodendrocyte progenitor cells enhances their migration rate. To determine whether Olig2 overexpression in adult oligodendrocyte progenitor cells promotes oligodendrocyte regeneration for myelin repair, we induced lysophosphatidylcholine demyelination in the corpus callosum of TetOlig2:Sox10<sup>rtTA/+</sup> and control mice. We found that Olig2 overexpression enhanced oligodendrocyte progenitor cell differentiation and remyelination. To assess the relevance of these findings in demyelinating diseases, we also examined OLIG2 expression in multiple sclerosis lesions. We demonstrate that OLIG2 displays a differential expression pattern in multiple sclerosis lesions that correlates with lesion activity. Strikingly, OLIG2 was predominantly detected in NOGO-A<sup>+</sup> (now known as RTN4-A) maturing oligodendrocytes, which prevailed in active lesion borders, rather than chronic silent and shadow plaques. Taken together, our data provide proof of principle indicating that OLIG2 overexpression in oligodendrocyte progenitor cells might be a possible therapeutic mechanism for enhancing myelin repair. © 2014 The Author.</p>"

His medical history included an episode of left facial palsy a year earlier. Neurological examination demonstrated only brisk deep tendon reflexes on the left upper limb. Routine blood and urine analyses were normal. Computed tomography of the brain and cervical Doppler were normal. Aspirin and sodium valproate were started, without improvement. Video-EEG monitoring revealed no electrographic abnormality synchronous with these paroxysmal events, excluding epileptic nature. Cerebral magnetic resonance imaging showed multiple T2 white matter lesions at the midbrain, right diencephalon, corpus callosum, cervical, and thoracic spinal cord. The right diencephalic lesion enhanced with gadolinium. Complete basic and immunologic analysis and serological studies were normal or negative. Oligoclonal bands were positive in cerebrospinal fluid (negative in serum). Methylprednisolone (1 g/d for 5 d) was started without clinical improvement. Carbamazepine (400 mg/d) was promptly effective, and discontinued after 1 month without recurrence.Discussion:The patient met the criteria for the diagnosis of MS according to the 2010 McDonald criteria. The timely and accurate diagnosis of MS requires the recognition of its varied and atypical clinical manifestations. © 2015 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.</p>"

672,2-s2.0-84947038296,Remyelination after Lysophosphatidyl Choline-Induced Demyelination Is Stimulated by Bone Marrow Stromal Cell-Derived Oligoprogenitor Cell Transplantation,"<p>Bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) are a desirable cell source that may be useful for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases given their capacity to differentiate into various types of cells. The current study aimed to investigate whether oligoprogenitor cell (OPC)-derived BMSCs have therapeutic benefits in an animal model of local demyelination. BMSCs were transdifferentiated into OPCs using a defined culture medium supplemented with a combination of inducers. The differentiation capacity of the BMSCs was evaluated at the end of the induction phase by assessing the expression levels of the glial-specific markers oligodendrocyte transcription factor 2 and O4 surface antigen. Local demyelination was induced in the corpus callosum of adult female rats via direct injection of lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) followed by engraftment of BMSC-generated OPCs. The rats were divided into sham control, vehicle control, and cell-transplanted groups. The changes in the extent of demyelination and the robustness of the remyelination event were assessed using Luxol Fast Blue staining and immunohistochemical analysis 1 week after LPC injection and 2 weeks after cell transplantation. Consequently, transplantation of OPCs into the demyelinated corpus callosum model resulted in differentiation of the cells into mature oligodendrocytes that were immunopositive for myelin basic protein. Furthermore, OPC transplantation mitigated demyelination and augmented remyelination relative to controls. These findings suggest that BMSC-derived OPCs can be utilized in therapeutic approaches for the management of demyelination-associated diseases such as multiple sclerosis. © 2015 S.

673,2-s2.0-84986193497,Functional connectivity changes and their relationship with clinical disability and white matter integrity in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis,"<p>Background and objective: To define the pathological substrate underlying disability in multiple sclerosis by evaluating the relationship of resting-state functional connectivity with microstructural brain damage, as assessed by diffusion tensor imaging, and clinical impairments. Methods: Thirty relapsing-remitting patients and 24 controls underwent 3T-MRI; motor abilities were evaluated by using measures of walking speed, hand dexterity and balance capability, while information processing speed was evaluated by a paced auditory serial addiction task. Independent component analysis and tract-based spatial statistics were applied to RS-fMRI and diffusion tensor imaging data using FSL software. Group differences, after dual regression, and clinical correlations were modelled with General-Linear-Model and corrected for multiple comparisons. Results: Patients showed decreased functional connectivity in 5 of 11 resting-state-networks (cerebellar, executive-control, medial-visual, basal ganglia and sensorimotor), changes in inter-network correlations and widespread white matter microstructural damage. In multiple sclerosis, corpus callosum microstructural damage positively correlated with functional connectivity in cerebellar and auditory networks. Moreover, functional connectivity within the medial-visual network inversely correlated with information processing speed. White matter widespread microstructural damage inversely correlated with both the paced auditory serial addiction task and hand dexterity. Conclusions: Despite the within-network functional connectivity decrease and the widespread microstructural damage, the inter-network functional connectivity changes suggest a global brain functional rearrangement in multiple sclerosis. The correlation between functional connectivity alterations and callosal damage uncovers a link between functional and structural connectivity. Finally, functional connectivity abnormalities affect information processing speed rather than motor abilities. © SAGE Publications.</p>"

Objective We evaluated the structural brain abnormalities in patients with NMOSD and with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) using with MRI. Methods Twenty-one NMOSD patients with antibodies against aquaporin 4, 32 patients with RRMS, and current age- and sex- matched 39 healthy subjects underwent 3-T MRI. The differences in gray matter volume and fractional anisotropy (FA) value among the three groups were evaluated. Results There were significant global gray matter volume reductions of NMOSD and RRMS groups, compared to the healthy subjects. Significant and diffuse decreases in FA values were observed in both the NMOSD and RRMS patients. Significant gray matter volume and FA value reductions of the RRMS patients in the bilateral thalami and some regions were observed compared to the NMOSD patients. Conclusion Larger brain structural changes were seen in the RRMS group compared to the NMOSD group, and among them, the thalamus was revealed as the important region for the discrimination of these two diseases. MRI analyses of the brain may be helpful in differentiating NMOSD from RRMS patients. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.</p>"
675,2-s2.0-84946837200,Fiber orientation and compartment parameter estimation from multi-shell diffusion imaging,"<p>Diffusion MRI offers the unique opportunity of assessing the structural connections of human brains in vivo. With the advance of diffusion MRI technology, multi-shell imaging methods are becoming increasingly practical for large scale studies and clinical application. In this work, we propose a novel method for the analysis of multi-shell diffusion imaging data by incorporating compartment models into a spherical deconvolution framework for fiber orientation distribution (FOD) reconstruction. For numerical implementation, we develop an adaptively constrained energy minimization approach to efficiently compute the solution. On simulated and real data from Human Connectome Project (HCP), we show that our method not only reconstructs sharp and clean FODs for the modeling of fiber crossings, but also generates reliable estimation of compartment parameters with great potential for clinical research of neurological diseases. In comparisons with publicly available DSI-Studio and BEDPOSTX of FSL, we demonstrate that our method reconstructs sharper FODs with more precise estimation of fiber directions. By applying probabilistic tractography to the FODs computed by our method, we show that more complete reconstruction of the corpus callosum bundle can be achieved. On a clinical, two-shell diffusion imaging data, we also demonstrate the feasibility of our method in analyzing white matter lesions. © 1982-2012 IEEE.</p>"

However, only a few studies have reported manic episodes concomitant with new lesions enhanced by gadolinium on brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Here we report the case of a 47-year-old woman suffering from MS admitted for a manic episode with psychotic features. Brain MRI revealed three new T2 lesions enhanced by gadolinium located in the corpus callosum and in ventromedial prefrontal regions. She rapidly recovered with intravenous methylprednisolone in combination with risperidone. In conclusion, in this patient, the fact that gadolinium-enhancing lesion coincided with new symptoms which responded quickly to corticosteroids suggests that the manic episode was an acute manifestation of MS. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.</p>"
677,2-s2.0-84945543444,Mesenchymal stem cells do not exert direct beneficial effects on CNS remyelination in the absence of the peripheral immune system,"<p>Remyelination is the natural repair mechanism in demyelinating disorders such as multiple sclerosis (MS) and it was proposed that it might protect from axonal loss. For unknown reasons, remyelination is often incomplete or fails in MS lesions and therapeutic treatments to enhance remyelination are not available. Recently, the transplantation of exogenous mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) has emerged as a promising tool to enhance repair processes. This included the animal model experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a commonly used model for the autoimmune mechanisms of MS. However, in EAE it is not clear if the beneficial effect of MSC derives from a direct influence on brain resident cells or if this is an indirect phenomenon via modulation of the peripheral immune system. The aim of this study was to determine potential regenerative functions of MSC in the toxic cuprizone model of demyelination that allows studying direct effects on de- and remyelination without the influence of the peripheral immune system. MSC from three different species (human, murine, canine) were transplanted either intraventricularly into the cerebrospinal fluid or directly into the lesion of the corpus callosum at two time points: at the onset of oligodendrocyte progenitor cell (OPC) proliferation or the peak of OPC proliferation during cuprizone induced demyelination. Our results show that MSC did not exert any regenerative effects after cuprizone induced demyelination and oligodendrocyte loss. During remyelination, MSC did not influence the dynamics of OPC proliferation and myelin formation. In conclusion, MSC did not exert direct regenerative functions in a mouse model where peripheral immune cells and especially T lymphocytes do not play a role. We thus suggest that the peripheral immune system is required for MSC to exert their effects and this is independent from a direct influence of the central nervous system. © 2015 Elsevier Inc..</p>"

A secondary aim was to compare these two methods with volumetric measurements. Methods: This study was based on a cohort of 37 MS patients and a group of age- and gender-matched healthy controls. Physical disability was assessed with the expanded disability status scale (EDSS) and cognitive disability with the symbol digit modalities test (SDMT). CCA and CCI were assessed on midsagittal brain MRI by 3 raters with varying radiological experience. Volumes of the brain, gray and white matter, corpus callosum, and MS lesions were acquired with Freesurfer and Lesion Segmentation Toolbox for Statistical Parametric Mapping. Results: CCA and CCI were obtained within seconds with excellent intra- and inter-rater agreement, and outperformed volumetric measurements. CCA had the strongest correlations with both SDMT (r = .82, P &lt; .001) and EDSS (r = -.56, P &lt; .001), and the highest accuracy in differentiating patients from controls (95%) and relapse-remitting MS from progressive forms of MS (77%). CCI performed less well (r = .73, P &lt; .001; r = -.45, P &lt; .001; 94%; 71%). CCA also outperformed the volumetric measurements in these regards. Conclusions: CCA is a time-effective and robust biomarker that has stronger correlations with both EDSS and information processing speed than CCI and volumetric measurements that are commonly used as outcome measures in MS research and clinical trials. © 2015 by the American Society of Neuroimaging.</p>"

In this study, remyelinating potential of progesterone in corpus callosum was evaluated on an experimental model of MS. Methods: In this experimental study, adult male C57BL/6 mice were fed with 0.2% (w/w) cuprizone in ground breeder chow ad libitum for 6 weeks. At day zero, after cuprizone removal, mice were divided randomly into two groups: (a) placebo group which received saline pellet implant, (b) progesterone group, which received progesterone pellet implant. Some mice of the same age were fed with their normal diet to serve as the healthy control group. Two weeks after progesterone administration, Myelin content was assessed by Luxol-fast blue staining. The myelin basic protein (MBP) and proteolipid protein (PLP) expression were assessed using Western blot analysis and the changes in the number of oligodendrocytes and oligodendroglial progenitor cells were assessed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and flow cytometry. Results: Luxol-fast blue staining revealed enhanced remyelination in the progesterone group when compared with the placebo group. Densitometry measurements of immunoblots demonstrated that MBP and PLP proteins contents were significantly increased in the progesterone group compared with the placebo group. Flow cytometry and IHC analysis showed increases in Olig2 and O4 cells in the progesterone group compared with the placebo group. Conclusion: Overall, our results indicate that progesterone treatment can stimulate myelin production and that it may provide a feasible and practical way for remyelination in diseases such as multiple sclerosis. © 2015, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences.

681,2-s2.0-84941979107,The role of CNS TLR2 activation in mediating innate versus adaptive neuroinflammation,"<p>Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) is expressed on immune cells in the periphery and the CNS and mediates both innate and adaptive immune responses. Recent studies have implicated TLR2 in systemic pathogenesis of adaptive immunity in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). In addition, TLR2 is expressed on oligodendrocyte progenitor cells and its activation inhibits their differentiation and myelination. We investigated the roles of CNS TLR2 activation in mediating neuro-inflammatory responses in intact versus EAE animals. We examined the effects of intra-cerebro-ventricular (ICV) injection of Zymosan, a TLR2 agonist, on naive versus EAE animals. The neuro-inflammatory response was characterized by immune-fluorescent staining for IBA-1. + microglia/macrophages and CD3. + T cells, and by semi-quantitative real time PCR for TLR2 and immune cytokines. The nature of the immune cells isolated from EAE brain tissue was assessed by their proliferative response to the PLP peptide autoantigen. Survival and clinical scores were monitored; demyelination and axonal loss were quantified by Gold-Black and Bielschowsky stains. Our findings showed that Zymosan injection in naïve mice induced a massive neuro-inflammatory response without any clinical manifestations. In EAE mice, ICV Zymosan induced a severe acute toxic response with 80% mortality. Surviving animals returned to pre-injection clinical score, and their course of disease was not altered as compared to control EAE group. Demyelination and axonal loss were not affected by ICV Zymosan injection. Quantification of immune response in the brain by real time PCR, immunofluorescent stains and proliferative response to PLP peptide suggested that TLR2 activation induces innate but not adaptive immune response. We conclude that EAE mice are hypersensitive to CNS TLR2 activation with a severe toxic response. This might represent the susceptibility of multiple sclerosis patients to even trivial infections. As CNS TLR2 activation does not alter the clinical and pathological course of EAE, it implies that CNS TLR2 activation affects the innate but not adaptive brain immune responses. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.</p>"
682,2-s2.0-84942197205,Anatomical Distribution of Cuprizone-Induced Lesions in C57BL6 Mice,"<p>Although multiple sclerosis (MS) has been considered a white matter disease, MS lesions occur frequently in the gray matter parts of the brain. Gray matter demyelination and atrophy are found during earliest disease stages, and a growing body of evidence demonstrates a positive correlation between gray matter pathology and various measures of motor disability and cognitive impairment. The cuprizone model is classically regarded as white matter demyelination model. However, recent evidence suggests that different gray matter areas are also affected. In this study, we address the vulnerability of white and gray matter forebrain regions in the cuprizone model. While the corpus callosum as interhemispheric white matter tract is affected in this model, other white matter tracts such as the mammillo-thalamic tract, the columns of the fornix, the stria terminalis, the optic tract, or hippocampal fimbria do not present overt demyelination after 5-week cuprizone intoxication. In contrast, gray matter demyelination is widespread in this model. Furthermore, vulnerable white matter tracts display extensive acute axonal damage. These results highlight the relevance of the cuprizone model to study MS-related gray matter pathology and neurodegeneration. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.</p>"

Demyelination was achieved by feeding transgenic mice overexpressing the transmembrane form of Klotho (KL-OE) and wild-type (WT) littermates cuprizone-containing chow for 6 weeks. The animals were then allowed to remyelinate for 3 weeks. Paraphenylenediamine staining and platelets-derived growth factor receptor α (PDGFRα) and glutathione S-transferase pi (GSTpi) immunohistochemistry were performed on corpus callosum (CC) sections for quantification of myelin and progenitor and mature oligodendrocytes, respectively. The EAE model was induced with the MOG<sub>35–55</sub> peptide. The animals were scored daily for clinical symptoms for 30 days. Following 6 weeks of demyelination, both KL-OE mice and WT littermates demonstrated almost complete and comparable demyelination of the CC. However, the level of spontaneous remyelination was increased approximately two-fold in KL-OE mice, although no significant differences in the numbers of PDGFRα and GSTpi-positive cells were observed. Following EAE induction, Klotho overexpression did not affect the clinical scores, likely due to the different roles Klotho plays in the brain and spinal cord. Thus, increasing Klotho expression should be considered as a therapy for enhancing remyelination in the brains of individuals with multiple sclerosis. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.</p>"
684,2-s2.0-84949423395,"Orientation dependent mr signal decay differentiates between people with MS, their asymptomatic siblings and unrelated healthy controls","<p>R2∗ relaxometry of the brain is a quantitative magnetic resonance technique which is influenced by iron and myelin content across different brain regions. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a common inflammatory, demyelinating disease affecting both white and grey matter regions of the CNS. Using R2∗, increased iron deposition has been described in deep gray matter of MS patients. Iron accumulation might promote oxidative stress in the brain, which can lead to cell death and neurodegeneration. However, recent histological work indicates that iron may be reduced within the normal appearing white matter (WM) in MS. In the present study we analyzed the R2∗ signal across the white matter in 39 patients with MS, 31 asymptomatic age matched siblings of patients and 30 age-matched controls. The measurement of R2∗ in white matter is affected by the signal's dependency on white matter fibre orientation with respect to the main magnetic field which can be accounted using diffusion tensor imaging. We observed a clear separation of the three study groups in R2∗. The values in the MS group were significantly lower compared to the siblings and controls, while the siblings group presented with significantly higher R2∗ values than both unrelated healthy controls and patients. Furthermore, we found significantly decreased normal-appearing white matter R2∗ values in patients with more severe disease course. Angle resolved analysis of R2∗ improves the sensitivity for detecting subtle differences in WM R2∗ compared to standard histogram based analyses. Our findings suggest that the decreased R2∗ values in MS are due to diffuse tissue damage and decreased myelin in the normal appearing and diffusely abnormal WM. The increased R2∗ in unaffected siblings may identify a predisposition to increased iron and the potential for oxidative stress as a risk factor for developing MS. © Copyright: 2015 Hernández-Torres et al.

685,2-s2.0-84944755267,A distinct class of antibodies may be an indicator of gray matter autoimmunity in early and established relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis patients,"<p>We have previously identified a distinct class of antibodies expressed by B cells in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of early and established relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) patients that is not observed in healthy donors. These antibodies contain a unique pattern of mutations in six codons along V<sub>H</sub>4 antibody genes that we termed the antibody gene signature (AGS). In fact, patients who have such B cells in their CSF are identified as either having RRMS or developing RRMS in the future. As mutations in antibody genes increase antibody affinity for particular antigens, the goal for this study was to investigate whether AGS+ antibodies bind to brain tissue antigens. Single B cells were isolated from the CSF of 10 patients with early or established RRMS. We chose 32 of these B cells that expressed antibodies enriched for the AGS for further study. We generated monoclonal full-length recombinant human antibodies (rhAbs) and used both immunological assays and immunohistochemistry to investigate the capacity of these AGS+ rhAbs to bind brain tissue antigens. AGS+ rhAbs did not recognize myelin tracts in the corpus callosum. Instead, AGS+ rhAbs recognized neuronal nuclei and/or astrocytes, which are prevalent in the cortical gray matter. This pattern was unique to the AGS+ antibodies from early and established RRMS patients, as AGS+ antibodies from an early neuromyelitis optica patient did not display the same reactivity. Prevalence of CSF- derived B cells expressing AGS+ antibodies that bind to these cell types may be an indicator of gray matter-directed autoimmunity in early and established RRMS patients. © The Author(s) 2015.</p>"

Material/Methods: Thirty-six patients (mean age 33.4 yrs) with clinically definite, relapsing-remitting MS and mild disability (EDSS – Expanded Disability Status Scale 1–3.5) and 16 control subjects (mean age 34.4 yrs) were enrolled in the study. DTI examinations were performed on a 1.5T MR scanner. Fractional anisotropy (FA) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values were obtained with a small ROI method in several white matter tracts within NAWM including: the middle cerebellar peduncles (MCP), the inferior longitudinal fasciculi (ILF), inferior frontooccipital fasciculi (IFOF), genu (GCC) and splenium of the corpus callosum (SCC), posterior limbs of the internal capsules (PLIC), superior longitudinal fasciculi (SLF) and posterior cingula (CG). There were no demyelinative lesions within the ROIs in any of the patients. Results: A significant decrease in FA was found in MS patients in both the ILFs and IFOFs (p&lt;0.001) and in the left MCP and right SLF (p&lt;0.05), compared to the normal subjects. There were no significant differences in FA values in the remaining evaluated ROIs, between MS patients and the control group.

Our aim was to investigate white matter tract changes and their association with cognitive function in patients with MS and those with neuropsychiatric systemic lupus erythematosus compared with healthy controls by using diffusion tensor imaging. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty patients with relapsing-remitting MS and 23 patients with neuropsychiatric systemic lupus erythematosus matched for disease severity and duration and 43 healthy controls were scanned with 3T MR imaging. The DTI was postprocessed, corrected for lesions, and analyzed with tract-based spatial statistics. Cognitive assessment included examination of processing speed; visual, auditory/verbal, and visual-spatial memory; and sustained attention and executive function. Differences were considered significant at P &lt; .05. RESULTS: Tract-based spatial statistics analysis revealed significantly decreased fractional anisotropy and increased mean diffusivity in patients with MS compared with healthy controls, decreased fractional anisotropy in patients with MS compared with those with neuropsychiatric systemic lupus erythematosus, and an increased mean diffusivity in patients with neuropsychiatric systemic lupus erythematosus compared with healthy controls. Patients with MS showed decreased fractional anisotropy throughout central WM pathways, including the corpus callosum and the inferior longitudinal and fronto-occipital fasciculi compared with those with neuropsychiatric systemic lupus erythematosus. Altered cognitive scores in patients with MS were significantly associated with decreased fractional anisotropy and increased mean diffusivity in all examined domains, while in patients with diffuse neuropsychiatric systemic lupus erythematosus, only decreased fractional anisotropy in the superior WM pathways showed significant association with executive function. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with MS and neuropsychiatric systemic lupus erythematosus showed widespreadWMtract alterations outside overt lesions, though more severe changes were identified in patients with MS. The WM tract changes were associated with cognitive dysfunction in all explored domains only in patients with MS.</p>"

690,2-s2.0-84938972696,Fibroblast growth factor signaling in oligodendrocyte-lineage cells facilitates recovery of chronically demyelinated lesions but is redundant in acute lesions,"<p>Remyelination is a potent regenerative process in demyelinating diseases, such as multiple sclerosis, the effective therapeutic promotion of which will fill an unmet clinical need. The development of proregenerative therapies requires the identification of key regulatory targets that are likely to be involved in the integration of multiple signaling mechanisms. Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling system, which comprises multiple ligands and receptors, potentially provides one such target. Since the FGF/FGF receptor (FGFR) interactions are complex and regulate multiple diverse functions of oligodendrocyte lineage cells, it is difficult to predict their overall therapeutic potential in the regeneration of oligodendrocytes and myelin. Therefore, to assess the integrated effects of FGFR signaling on this process, we simultaneously inactivated both FGFR1 and FGFR2 in oligodendrocytes and their precursors using two Cre-driver mouse lines. Acute and chronic cuprizone-induced or lysolecithin-induced demyelination was established in Fgfr1/Fgfr2 double knockout mice (dKO). We found that in the acute cuprizone model, there was normal differentiation of oligodendrocytes and recovery of myelin in the corpus callosum of both control and dKO mice. Similarly, in the spinal cord, lysolecithin-induced demyelinated lesions regenerated similarly in the dKO and control mice. In contrast, in the chronic cuprizone model, fewer differentiated oligodendrocytes and less efficient myelin recovery were observed in the dKO compared to control mice. These data suggest that while cell-autonomous FGF signaling is redundant during recovery of acute demyelinated lesions, it facilitates regenerative processes in chronic demyelination. Thus, FGF-based therapies have potential value in stimulating oligodendrocyte and myelin regeneration in late-stage disease. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p>"

Because of their immunomodulatory properties they have been utilized to treat autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS), which is characterized by demyelination. The microenvironment surrounding MSCs is thought to affect their differentiation and phenotype, which could in turn affect the efficacy. We thus sought to dissect the potential for differential impact of MSCs on central nervous system (CNS) disease in T cell mediated and non-T cell mediated settings using the MOG<sub>35-55</sub> experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) and cuprizone-mediated demyelination models, respectively. As the pathogeneses of MS and EAE are thought to be mediated by IFNγ-producing (T<sub>H</sub>1) and IL-17A-producing (T<sub>H</sub>17) effector CD4+ T cells, we investigated the effect of MSCs on the development of these two key pathogenic cell groups. Although MSCs suppressed the activation and effector function of T<sub>H</sub>17 cells, they did not affect T<sub>H</sub>1 activation, but enhanced T<sub>H</sub>1 effector function and ultimately produced no effect on EAE. In the non-T cell mediated cuprizone model of demyelination, MSC administration had a positive effect, with an overall increase in myelin abundance in the brain of MSC-treated mice compared to controls. These results highlight the potential variability of MSCs as a biologic therapeutic tool in the treatment of autoimmune disease and the need for further investigation into the multifaceted functions of MSCs in diverse microenvironments and the mechanisms behind the diversity. © 2015 Glenn et al.

694,2-s2.0-84941578601,Blood coagulation protein fibrinogen promotes autoimmunity and demyelination via chemokine release and antigen presentation,"<p>Autoimmunity and macrophage recruitment into the central nervous system (CNS) are critical determinants of neuroinflammatory diseases. However, the mechanisms that drive immunological responses targeted to the CNS remain largely unknown. Here we show that fibrinogen, a central blood coagulation protein deposited in the CNS after blood-brain barrier disruption, induces encephalitogenic adaptive immune responses and peripheral macrophage recruitment into the CNS leading to demyelination. Fibrinogen stimulates a unique transcriptional signature in CD11b + antigen-presenting cells inducing the recruitment and local CNS activation of myelin antigen-specific Th1 cells. Fibrinogen depletion reduces Th1 cells in the multiple sclerosis model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) II-dependent antigen presentation, CXCL10- and CCL2-mediated recruitment of T cells and macrophages, respectively, are required for fibrinogen-induced encephalomyelitis. Inhibition of the fibrinogen receptor CD11b/CD18 protects from all immune and neuropathologic effects. Our results show that the final product of the coagulation cascade is a key determinant of CNS autoimmunity. © 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited.</p>"
695,2-s2.0-84940938405,Inactivation of protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type Z by pleiotrophin promotes remyelination through activation of differentiation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells,"<p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a progressive neurological disorder associated with myelin destruction and neurodegeneration. Oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) present in demyelinated lesions gradually fail to differentiate properly, so remyelination becomes incomplete. Protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type Z (PTPRZ), one of the most abundant protein tyrosine phosphatases expressed in OPCs, is known to suppress oligodendrocyte differentiation and maintain their precursor cell stage. In the present study, we examined the in vivo mechanisms for remyelination using a cuprizone-induced demyelination model. Ptprz-deficient and wild-type mice both exhibited severe demyelination and axonal damage in the corpus callosum after cuprizone feeding. The similar accumulation of OPCs was observed in the lesioned area in both mice; however, remyelination was significantly accelerated in Ptprz-deficient mice after the removal of cuprizone. After demyelination, the expression of pleiotrophin (PTN), an inhibitory ligand for PTPRZ, was transiently increased in mouse brains, particularly in the neurons involved, suggesting its role in promoting remyelination by inactivating PTPRZ activity. In support of this view, oligodendrocyte differentiation was augmented in a primary culture of oligodendrocyte-lineage cells from wild-type mice in response to PTN. In contrast, these cells from Ptprz-deficient mice showed higher oligodendrocyte differentiation without PTN and differentiation was not enhanced by its addition. We further demonstrated that PTN treatment increased the tyrosine phosphorylation of p190 RhoGAP, a PTPRZ substrate, using an established line of OPCs. Therefore, PTPRZ inactivation in OPCs by PTN, which is secreted from demyelinated axons, may be the mechanism responsible for oligodendrocyte differentiation during reparative remyelination in the CNS. © 2015 the authors.</p>"

We aimed to investigate the effect of multiple i.p. BM-MSCs injections in the cuprizone model of multiple sclerosis in mice. Methods: Adult male C57BL/6 mice (n = 40) were fed a regular diet or a diet containing cuprizone (0.2% w/w) for six weeks. Bone marrow samples were taken from patients with spinal cord injury. BM-MSCs (2 × 10<sup>6</sup> in 1 milliliter medium) were administered intraperitoneally for two consecutive weeks at the end of the forth weeks of cuprizone administration. Animals (n = 12) were perfused with 10% paraformaldehyde at the end of sixth week. The brains were sectioned coronally in 6-8-μm thickness (-2.3 to 1.8 mm from bregma). The sections were stained by luxol fast blue-cresyl violet, and images were captured via a microscope. Demyelination ratio was estimated in corpus callosum in a blind manner. A quantitative real-time PCR was used to measure the myelin basic protein gene expression at sixth week. Results: Histologically, cuprizone induced demyelination in the corpus callosum. Demyelinated area was diminished in the corpus callosum of cell-administered group. Cuprizone could decrease myelin-binding protein mRNAs expression in corpus callosum, which was significantly recovered after BM-MSCs injections. Conclusion: Our data indicated a remyelination potency of multiple i.p. BM-MSCs in the cuprizone model of multiple sclerosis in mice. © 2015, Pasteur Institute of Iran. All rights reserved.</p>"
697,2-s2.0-84938519804,Remyelination After Cuprizone-Induced Demyelination Is Accelerated in Juvenile Mice,"<p>Remyelination capacity decreases with age in adult mice, but data comparing remyelination capacity after toxic demyelination in developing mice versus adult mice are not available. We treated 3-week-old and adult C57BL/6 mice with cuprizone for 1 to 5 weeks and studied demyelination/remyelination and cellular reactions in the corpus callosum and motor cortex by histology, immunohistochemistry, and electron microscopy. We compared results between the 2 treated groups and age-matched controls. In juvenile mice, significant demyelination was detectable in the corpus callosum on Week 2 and in the motor cortex on Week 5. Oligodendrocyte loss, microglial activation, and acute axonal damage peaked on Week 2. Increased numbers of oligodendrocyte precursor cells were evident on Week 1, and remyelination was detectable on Week 3. Juvenile mice showed more rapid demyelination than adult mice, which may be related to greater vulnerability of oligodendrocytes, lower myelin content, or dose-dependent cuprizone effects. Earlier activation of microglia and proliferation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells probably contributed to accelerated remyelination and less pronounced axonal damage. Our data indicate that oligodendroglial regeneration and remyelination are enhanced in the maturing rodent brain compared with the young-adult rodent brain.

698,2-s2.0-84985995983,Corpus callosum atrophy is strongly associated with cognitive impairment in multiple sclerosis: Results of a 17-year longitudinal study,"<p>Background: Cognitive impairment is common in multiple sclerosis (MS) and may be subtle. The corpus callosum is essential for connectivity-demanding cognitive tasks and is significantly affected in MS, therefore it may serve as a marker for cognitive function. Objective: The objective of this paper is to longitudinally study the normalized corpus callosum area (nCCA) as a marker of cognitive function and disability in MS. Methods: Thirty-seven MS patients were followed from 1996 with follow-ups in 2004 and 2013. A healthy matched control group was recruited. The Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) and Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) were assessed. The nCCA was measured on T2-weighted images. Volumetry was performed with FreeSurfer. Results: Disease duration spanned five decades (1.646 years). Annual corpus callosal atrophy rate decreased with disease duration. nCCA was strongly correlated with SDMT (r = 0.793, p &lt; 0.001) and moderately correlated with EDSS (r = 0.545, p &lt; 0.001) after adjusting for disease duration, age and sex.The correlations of brain parenchymal fraction, white matter fraction, gray matter fraction and normalized lesion volume were less strong. Conclusions: The nCCA correlates well with physical and cognitive disability in time perspectives close to two decades, outperforming volumetric measurements. The nCCA is fast and could be feasible for clinical implementation where it may help identify patients in need of neuropsychological evaluation. © The Author(s), 2015.</p>"

Cyclic AMP and its analogs are well known to decrease inflammation and apoptosis. In the present study, we examined the effects of bucladesine, a cell-permeable analogue of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), on myelin proteins (PLP, PMP-22), inflammation, and apoptotic, as well as anti-apoptotic factors in cuprizone model of demyelination. C57BL/6J mice were fed with chow containing 0.2 % copper chelator cuprizone or vehicle by daily oral gavage for 5 weeks to induce reversible demyelination predominantly of the corpus callosum. Bucladesine was administered intraperitoneally at different doses (0.24, 0.48, or 0.7 μg/kg body weight) during the last 7 days of 5-week cuprizone treatment. Bucladesine exhibited a protective effect on myelination. Furthermore, bucladesine significantly decreased the production of interleukin-6 pro-inflammatory mediator as well as nuclear factor-κB activation and reduced the mean number of apoptotic cells compared to cuprizone-treated mice. Bucladesine also decreased production of caspase-3 as well as Bax and increased Bcl-2 levels. Our data revealed that enhancement of intracellular cAMP prevents demyelination and plays anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic properties in mice cuprizone model of demyelination. This suggests the modulation of intracellular cAMP as a potential target for treatment of MS. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.</p>"
700,2-s2.0-84937813704,Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug indometacin enhances endogenous remyelination,"<p>Multiple sclerosis is the most frequent demyelinating disease in the CNS that is characterized by inflammatory demyelinating lesions and axonal loss, the morphological correlate of permanent clinical disability. Remyelination does occur, but is limited especially in chronic disease stages. Despite effective immunomodulatory therapies that reduce the number of relapses the progressive disease phase cannot be prevented. Therefore, promotion of neuroprotective and repair mechanisms, such as remyelination, represents an attractive additional treatment strategy. A number of pathways have been identified that may contribute to impaired remyelination in MS lesions, among them the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. Here, we demonstrate that indometacin, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that has been also shown to modulate the Wnt/β-catenin pathway in colorectal cancer cells promotes differentiation of primary human and murine oligodendrocytes, myelination of cerebellar slice cultures and remyelination in cuprizone-induced demyelination. Our in vitro experiments using GSK3β inhibitors, luciferase reporter assays and oligodendrocytes expressing a mutant, dominant stable β-catenin indicate that the mechanism of action of indometacin depends on GSK3β activity and β-catenin phosphorylation. Indometacin might represent a promising treatment option to enhance endogenous remyelination in MS patients. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.</p>"
701,2-s2.0-84937251053,Reproducibility and optimization of in vivo human diffusion-weighted MRS of the corpus callosum at 3T and 7T,"<p>Diffusion-weighted MRS (DWS) of brain metabolites enables the study of cell-specific alterations in tissue microstructure by probing the diffusion of intracellular metabolites. In particular, the diffusion properties of neuronal N-acetylaspartate (NAA), typically co-measured with N-acetylaspartyl glutamate (NAAG) (NAA+NAAG=tNAA), have been shown to be sensitive to intraneuronal/axonal damage in pathologies such as stroke and multiple sclerosis. Lacking, so far, are empirical assessments of the reproducibility of DWS measures across time and subjects, as well as a systematic investigation of the optimal acquisition parameters for DWS experiments, both of which are sorely needed for clinical applications of the method. In this study, we acquired comprehensive single-volume DWS datasets of the human corpus callosum at 3T and 7T. We investigated the inter- and intra-subject variability of empirical and modeled diffusion properties of tNAA [D<sub>avg</sub>(tNAA) and D<sub>model</sub>(tNAA), respectively]. Subsequently, we used a jackknife-like resampling approach to explore the variance of these properties in partial data subsets reflecting different total scan durations. The coefficients of variation (C<sub>V</sub>) and repeatability coefficients (C<sub>R</sub>) for D<sub>avg</sub>(tNAA) and D<sub>model</sub>(tNAA) were calculated for both 3T and 7T, with overall lower variability in the 7T results. Although this work is limited to the estimation of the diffusion properties in the corpus callosum, we show that a careful choice of diffusion-weighting conditions at both field strengths allows the accurate measurement of tNAA diffusion properties in clinically relevant experimental time. Based on the resampling results, we suggest optimized acquisition schemes of 13-min duration at 3T and 10-min duration at 7T, whilst retaining low variability (C<sub>V</sub>≈8%) for the tNAA diffusion measures. Power calculations for the estimation of D<sub>model</sub>(tNAA) and D<sub>avg</sub>(tNAA) based on the suggested schemes show that less than 21 subjects per group are sufficient for the detection of a 10% effect between two groups in case-control studies. © 2015 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.</p>"

Supporting investigations such as CSF examination, fluorescein angiogram, visual field perimetry and audiology often yield important clues. In milder cases, however, diagnostic uncertainty can exist, and forme frustes of the disease are recognised.

Resting brain activity can be modulated by motor tasks to adapt to function. In multiple sclerosis (MS) patients, altered resting-state functional connectivity (RS-FC) has been reported and associated with impaired function and disability; little is known on how RS-FC is modulated by a simple repetitive motor task. Objective. To assess changes in RS-FC in early relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) patients associated with repetitive thumb flexions (RTFs). Methods. A total of 20 right-handed patients with early RRMS and 14 healthy controls underwent a resting functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scan, before and after 25 minutes of alternate 30-s blocks of right RTF and rest. Dual-regression analysis of resting fMRI data followed the independent component analysis. Individual spatial maps of coherence between brain areas for 2 networks of interest, sensorimotor and cerebellar, were compared at the group level and correlated with measures of both clinical impairment and brain damage. Results. Significant RTF-induced differences in RS-FC were observed between groups in the cerebellar network because of increased RS-FC in patients but not in controls. In the sensorimotor network, the RS-FC after RTF increased in both groups, with no significant between-group differences. The sensorimotor and the cerebellar RS-FC were intercorrelated only in patients and only after the RTF. The sensorimotor RS-FC increase in patients correlated with structural MRI alterations. Conclusions. Our study unmasked RS-FC changes of motor-related networks occurring after a simple repetitive motor task in early RRMS patients only. Evaluation of altered RSN dynamics might prove useful for anticipating neuroplasticity and for MRI-informed neurorehabilitation. © 2014 American Society of Neurorehabilitation.</p>"
705,2-s2.0-84936864771,Functional magnetic resonance imaging of rats with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis reveals brain cortex remodeling,"<p>Cortical reorganization occurring in multiple sclerosis(MS)patients isthoughtto playakeyrole in limiting the effect of structural tissuedamage. Conversely, its exhaustionmaycontribute to the irreversible disability that accumulates with disease progression. Several aspects of MS-related cortical reorganization, including the overall functional effect and likely modulation by therapies, still remain to be elucidated. The aim of this work was to assess the extent of functional cortical reorganization and its brain structural/pathological correlates in Dark Agouti rats with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a widely accepted preclinical model of chronic MS. Morphological and functional MRI (fMRI) were performed before disease induction and during the relapsing and chronic phases of EAE. During somatosensory stimulation of the right forepaw, fMRI demonstrated that cortical reorganization occurs in both relapsing and chronic phases of EAE with increased activated volume and decreased laterality index versus baseline values. Voxel-based morphometry demonstrated gray matter (GM) atrophy in the cerebral cortex, and both GM and white matter atrophy were assessed by ex vivo pathology of the sensorimotor cortex and corpus callosum. Neuroinflammation persisted in the relapsing and chronic phases, with dendritic spine density in the layer IV sensory neurons inversely correlating with the number of cluster of differentiation 45-positive inflammatory lesions. Our work provides an innovative experimental platform that may be pivotal for the comprehension of key mechanisms responsible for the accumulation of irreversible brain damage and for the development of innovative therapies to reduce disability in EAE/MS. © 2015 the authors.</p>"
706,2-s2.0-84945447966,Clinical and cognitive implications of cerebrospinal fluid oligoclonal bands in multiple sclerosis patients,"<p>The presence of cerebrospinal fluid oligoclonal bands (CSF-OCB) in Caucasian patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) is supportive of diagnosis, though the relation with patients’ clinical and specifically cognitive features has never been established or thoroughly examined. Thus, we investigated the clinical and for the first time the cognitive profile of MS patients in relation to CSF-OCB. We studied 108 patients with and without OCB and recorded demographic characteristics and detailed clinical data. A comprehensive neuropsychological battery covering different cognitive domains (attention/processing speed, memory, perception/constructions, reasoning, executive functions) was administered to MS patients and 142 demographically related healthy controls (HC). We did not find any significant differences between patients with and without OCB on demographic and clinical parameters (p &gt; 0.05), including subtype and brain neuroimaging findings. Results revealed significantly higher cognitive scores in HC compared to both OCB subgroups, with more widespread cognitive changes in patients with OCB. Analysis between OCB subgroups showed significantly worse performance in patients with OCB on visual memory (Rey’s complex figure test-recall; p = 0.006). Concluding, the presence of CSF-OCB in our MS patients tends to be related to more widespread cognitive changes, specifically worse visual memory. Future longitudinal studies in different populations are warranted to better clarify the clinical and cognitive characteristics related to CSF-OCB which could serve as early biomarker in disease monitoring. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Italia.</p>"

In a prospective observational study, the predictive role of baseline and 6-month changes in magnetic resonance imaging outcomes was investigated with respect to relapse activity and development of confirmed disability progression in patients after 48 months. Methods: This study examined 210 patients. Multivariate Cox proportional hazard models were used to analyse predictors of relapse activity and confirmed disability progression after 48 months. Results: Greater T2 lesion volume [hazard ratio (HR) 1.81; P = 0.005] and the presence of contrast-enhancing lesions (HR 2.13; P &lt; 0.001) at baseline were significantly associated with increased cumulative risk of a second clinical attack over 48 months. A greater decrease of the corpus callosum volume (HR 2.74; P = 0.001) and greater lateral ventricle volume enlargement (HR 2.43; P = 0.002) at 6 months relative to baseline were associated with increased cumulative risk of a second clinical attack between months 6 and 48. In addition, increased risk of confirmed disability progression over 48 months in patients with greater lateral ventricle volume enlargement between baseline and 6 months (HR 4.70; P = 0.001) was detected. Conclusions: A greater T2 lesion volume, the presence of contrast-enhancing lesions at baseline, decrease of corpus callosum volume and lateral ventricle volume enlargement over the first 6 months in patients after the first demyelinating event treated with weekly intramuscular interferon β-1a may assist in identification of patients with the highest risk of a second clinical attack and progression of disability. © 2015 EAN.</p>"
708,2-s2.0-84929705776,Longitudinal monitoring of metabolic alterations in cuprizone mouse model of multiple sclerosis using 1H-magnetic resonance spectroscopy,"<p>Non-invasive measures of well-known pathological hallmarks of multiple sclerosis (MS) such as demyelination, inflammation and axonal injury would serve as useful markers to monitor disease progression and evaluate potential therapies. To this end, in vivo localized proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (<sup>1</sup>H-MRS) provides a powerful means to monitor metabolic changes in the brain and may be sensitive to these pathological hallmarks. In our study, we used the cuprizone mouse model to study pathological features of MS, such as inflammation, de- and remyelination, in a highly reproducible manner. C57BL/6J mice were challenged with a 0.2% cuprizone diet for 6-weeks to induce demyelination, thereafter the mice were put on a cuprizone free diet for another 6weeks to induce spontaneous remyelination. We employed in vivo <sup>1</sup>H-MRS to longitudinally monitor metabolic changes in the corpus callosum of cuprizone-fed mice during the demyelination (weeks 4 and 6) and spontaneous remyelination (week 12) phases. The MRS spectra were quantified with LCModel and since the total creatine (tCr) levels did not change over time or between groups, metabolite concentrations were expressed as ratios relative to tCr. After 4 and 6weeks of cuprizone treatment a significant increase in taurine/tCr and a significant reduction in total N-acetylaspartate/tCr, total choline-containing compounds/tCr and glutamate/tCr could be observed compared to mice under normal diet. At week 12, when almost full remyelination was established, no statistically significant metabolic differences were present between the control and cuprizone group. Our results suggest that these metabolic changes may represent sensitive markers for cuprizone induced demyelination, axonal injury and inflammation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first longitudinal in vivo <sup>1</sup>H-MRS study that monitored biochemical changes in the corpus callosum of cuprizone fed mice. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.</p>"
709,2-s2.0-84926662495,Behavioural changes observed in demyelination model shares similarities with white matter abnormalities in humans,"<p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, inflammatory, demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS). Further to the symptoms resulting from demyelination, new studies point to the involvement of neuroinflammation and white matter abnormalities in psychiatric disorders and neurodegenerative diseases. Cuprizone, a model of MS, produces consistent demyelination and elicits behavioural, morphological and inflammatory changes in animals that share some similarities with those observed in humans. In this study, we used the cuprizone model in Lewis rats to evaluate clinical signs triggered by the demyelination process which could be comparable with the symptoms seen in white matter abnormalities in human beings. To induce the demyelination process, 0.6% cuprizone was added to the Lewis rats' diet for 4 weeks. We proceeded with behavioural, morphological and immunological analyses. Animals fed with cuprizone exhibited behavioural changes: higher scores in the neurotoxicity test, reduced exploratory and locomotion behaviour, and also an increase of permanency in the closed arm of the elevated plus maze test, were observed. In these analyses, the animals showed motor coordination impairment and anxiety-like behaviour. Demyelination also triggered changes in discrimination of objects identified by an increase in the time spent close to a familiar object. These behavioural alterations were associated with a significant increase in the levels of TNF-alpha and corticosterone, consistent with the activation of microglia and astrocytes. Taken together, the results of this work show the cuprizone/Lewis rat model demyelination as an attractive paradigm for studying the correlation between white matter abnormalities and behaviour. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.</p>"

The purpose of our study is to evaluate the damage of normal appearing white matter (NAWM) in patients with MS. In our study, 84 MS patients and 42 healthy adults underwent a routine brain MRI, including also diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). All studies were performed on a 3 T MRI scanner. Fractional anisotropy (FA) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values were obtained. The DTI parameters of NAWM were correlated with expanded disability status scales (EDSS) scores. Our results showed statistically significant differences in FA and ADC values between MS plaques and the symmetrical NAWM, as also between NAWM and the respective white matter in controls. The ADC values of the NAWM correlated with the EDSS scores. The present study demonstrated damage of the NAWM in MS patients, using DTI in 3.0 T.

Corpus callosum may be involved in both multiple sclerosis and neuromyelitis optica. Previous case reports have demonstrated that callosal lesions in neuromyelitis optica are usually large and edematous and have a heterogeneous intensity showing a ""marbled pattern"" in the acute phase. Their size and intensity may reduce with time or disappear in the chronic stages. Case presentation: In this report, we describe a case of a 25-year-old Caucasian man with neuromyelitis optica who presented clinically with optic neuritis and myelitis. His brain magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated linear enhancement of the corpus callosum. Brain images with contrast agent added also showed linear ependymal layer enhancement of the lateral ventricles, which has been reported in this disease previously. Conclusions: Linear enhancement of corpus callosum in magnetic resonance imaging with contrast agent could help in diagnosing neuromyelitis optica and differentiating it from other demyelinating disease, especially multiple sclerosis. © 2015 Sahraian et al.</p>"

In the present study we aimed to elucidate the relationship of microstructural WM damage in patients with varying periods of disease duration. DTI scans were acquired from 90 MS patients and 25 healthy controls. Patients were grouped to short (&lt;1 year), moderate (1 up to 6 years) and long (6-10 years) disease duration periods. Statistical analyses of the fractional anisotropy (FA) data were performed using tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS). Whole-brain skeletal FA measurements showed a significant decrease between healthy controls and the short MS disease duration group, as well as between moderate disease duration and long disease duration groups, but failed to show a significant difference between short and moderate disease duration groups. Voxelwise analysis revealed clusters of diffuse FA reductions in 40 WM tracts when comparing healthy controls and MS short disease duration group, with the point of maximal significant difference located in the left inferior longitudinal fasciculus. Comparing short with long disease duration groups, progressive FA reduction was demonstrated across 30 WM tracts, with the point of maximal significant difference migrating to the body of the corpus callosum. A non-linear pattern of WM microstructure disruption occurs in RRMS. Alterations are seen early in the disease course within 1 year from onset, reach a plateau within the next 5 years, and only later additional WM changes are detected. An important period of a possible therapeutic window therefore exists within the early disease stage. © 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.</p>"

We submitted 19 patients with PPMS to a neurological evaluation and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with volumetric analysis using FreeSurfer. We found no relation between the Expanded Disability Status Scale or disease duration and the grey matter or white matter structures analysed. Lesion load was negatively correlated with cortical and subcortical grey matter volumes, but not with total white matter volume. We concluded that physical disability in PPMS is not directly related to brain atrophy and that focal inflammatory white matter lesions may contribute to progressive neuronal degeneration. Long abstract Introduction: Primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS) is characterized by chronic progression since onset, with predominant involvement of the spinal cord and prominent neurodegeneration. Grey matter atrophy has been shown in patients with PPMS, but its association with clinical incapacity is uncertain. We investigated the relationship between regional brain atrophy and physical disability in patients with PPMS. Methods: Patients with an established diagnosis of PPMS underwent a neurological evaluation followed by brain MRI at 1.5 T. Volumetric analysis was performed with FreeSurfer software, and evaluated the neocortex, total white matter, total subcortical grey matter, putamen, caudate, globus pallidus, thalamus, hippocampus, brainstem, corpus callosum and pre-central gyrus volumes. Clinical data obtained included physical disability as measured by the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS). Results: Nineteen patients were included, 14 female (73.7%), mean age of 55.7 (SD 7.6) and mean disease duration of 13.0 years (SD 8.8). Median EDSS score was 6.0 (3.5-8.0). The average T1 lesion load (4.9 cm3, SD 3.4) and T2 load (10.5 cm3, SD 9.9) did not relate to disease duration. There was no significant correlation between EDSS score or disease duration and the cortical grey matter, deep grey matter or white matter structures analysed. Lesion load was negatively correlated with cortical and subcortical grey matter volumes (p&lt;0.05), but not with total white matter volume. Conclusions: Physical disability in PPMS is not directly related to brain volume loss. Grey matter atrophy correlates with lesion load in patients with PPMS, indicating that focal inflammatory white matter lesions may contribute to progressive neuronal degeneration. © The Author(s) 2015.</p>"
715,2-s2.0-84930988940,Enhanced axonal metabolism during early natalizumab treatment in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis,"<p>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The considerable clinical effect of natalizumab in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis might be explained by its possible beneficial effect on axonal functioning. In this longitudinal study, the effect of natalizumab on absolute concentrations of total N-acetylaspartate, a marker for neuronal integrity, and other brain metabolites is investigated in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis by using MR spectroscopic imaging. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this explorative observational study, 25 patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis initiating natalizumab treatment were included and scanned every 6 months for 18 months. Additionally 18 matched patients with relapsingremitting multiple sclerosis continuing treatment with interferon-β or glatiramer acetate were included along with 12 healthy controls. Imaging included short TE 2D-MR spectroscopic imaging with absolute metabolite quantification of total N-acetylaspartate, creatine and phosphocreatine, choline-containing compounds, myo-inositol, and glutamate. Concentrations were determined for lesional white matter, normal-appearing white matter, and gray matter. RESULTS: At baseline in both patient groups, lower concentrations of total N-acetylaspartate and creatine and phosphocreatine were found in lesional white matter compared with normal-appearing white matter and additionally lower glutamate in lesional white matter of patients receiving natalizumab. In those patients, a significant yearly metabolite increase was found for lesional white matter total N-acetylaspartate (7%, P &lt; .001), creatine and phosphocreatine (6%, P = .042), and glutamate (10%, P = .028), while lesion volumes did not change. In patients receiving interferon-β/glatiramer acetate, no significant change was measured in lesional white matter for any metabolite, while whole-brain normalized lesion volumes increased. CONCLUSIONS: Patients treated with natalizumab showed an increase in total N-acetylaspartate, creatine and phosphocreatine, and glutamate in lesional white matter. These increasing metabolite concentrations might be a sign of enhanced axonal metabolism.</p>"

717,2-s2.0-84939971508,Selected Extracellular microRNA as Potential Biomarkers of Multiple Sclerosis Activity—Preliminary Study,"<p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS). Four distinct disease courses are known, although approximately 90 % of patients are diagnosed with the relapsing-remitting form (RRMS). The name “multiple sclerosis” pertains to the underlying pathology: the presence of demyelinating plaques in the CNS, in particular in the periventricular region, corpus callosum, cervical spine, and the cerebellum. There are ongoing efforts to discover biomarkers that would allow for an unequivocal diagnosis, assess the activity of inflammatory and neurodegenerative processes, or warn of disease progression. At present, small noncoding RNA particles-microRNA (miRNA, miR) seem to be particularly noteworthy, as they take part in posttranscriptional regulation of expression of various genes. Changes in composition as well as function of miRNA found in body fluids of MS patients are subjects of research, in the hope they prove accurate markers of MS activity. This preliminary study aims to evaluate the expression of selected extracellular microRNA particles (miRNA-let-7a, miRNA-92a, miRNA-684a) in patients experiencing MS relapse and remission, with healthy volunteers serving as a control group and to evaluate the correlation between miRNA expression and selected clinical parameters of those patients. Thirty-seven patients suffering from MS formed two examined groups: 20 patients undergoing relapse and 17 in remission. Thirty healthy volunteers formed the control group. All patients who were subjects to peripheral blood sampling had been hospitalized in the Department of Neurology and Stroke<sup>1</sup>. Four milliliters of venous whole blood had been collected into EDTA tubes. The basis for the selection of the three particular miRNA investigated in this study (miRNA-let-7a, miRNA-92a, miRNA-684a) was a preliminary bioinformatic analysis of data compiled from several medical databases, including Ovid MEDLINE®, Embase, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR), miRWalk, and miRBase. The isolation of extracellular microRNA from plasma was carried out using miRNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) reagents. The reverse transcription was carried out with TaqMan® MicroRNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems), as per manufacturers’ instructions. Standard microRNA TaqMan® tests (Applied Biosystems) were used for miRNA quantification. The qPCR were performed on a 7900 HT Fast Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems) and analyzed using Sequence Detection System 2.3 software. In addition, all patients at the Department of Neurology and Stroke undergo a routine complete blood count with differential. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the expression of selected microRNA (has-miR-let-7a, miR-92a, and miR-648a) in the plasma of patients with MS during a relapse as well as in remission and attempt to correlate the acquired data with clinically relevant parameters of the disease. Finding such correlations may potentially lead to the use of miRNA as a biomarker of MS, which could help diagnose the disease and assess its severity and the efficacy of treatment. The difference in the expression of has-miR-let-7a in the remission group and the control group was statistically significant (p = 0.002). Similarly, the expression of miRNA-648a in patients in remission was significantly different from the expression in the control group (p = 0.02). Analysis of the correlation between the expression of miRNA-92a and the severity of the disease as measured by the EDSS scale in patients undergoing relapse showed significant negative linear correlation (r = −0.54, p = 0.01). Higher miR-648a expression correlated with more frequent flare-ups in the joint group of patients in remission and relapse (p = 0.03). This study is one of the few that demonstrate significantly changed expression of selected extracellular miRNA in plasma of MS patients and correlate those findings with clinical parameters. These observations may suggest that some miRNA subsets may be potential biomarkers for MS activity. © 2014, The Author(s).</p>"
718,2-s2.0-84930900165,Diagnostic value of 3D fluid attenuated inversion recovery sequence in multiple sclerosis,"<p>Background Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an indispensable tool in the diagnostic work-up of multiple sclerosis (MS). To date, guidelines suggest MRI protocols containing axial dual-echo, unenhanced and post-contrast T1-weighted sequences. Especially the usage of dual-echo sequences has markedly improved the ability of MRI to detect cortical and infratentorial lesions. Newer 3D FLAIR sequences are supposed to provide even more positive imaging features such as improved detection of white matter lesions and a better resolution due to smaller slice thickness. Purpose To evaluate the diagnostic impact of 3D FLAIR sequences in comparison to conventional T2 and PD sequences. Material and Methods Examinations of 20 MS patients (10 women, 10 men) were reviewed retrospectively. All patients received MRI standard protocol containing PD and T2 sequences and a mid-sagittal T2 sequence. Additionally an isotropic 3D FLAIR sequence was performed. Whole-brain lesion load and number of lesions in juxtacortical, infratentorial, and midcallosal localizations were assessed by two observers independently and compared. Results Whole lesion load and the count of detectable lesions at the 3D FLAIR sequence were significantly higher in the juxtacortical and infratentorial regions compared to the PD/T2 sequence. Detection rate of midcallosal lesions did not differ significantly in sagittal T2 and 3D FLAIR sequence. Conclusion 3D FLAIR sequences can improve the detection of brain lesions in patients with MS and are even more sensitive in depicting lesions in cortical and infratentorial locations than current dual-echo sequences. The sequence can replace both PD/T2 sequences and mid-sagittal T2 sequences of the corpus callosum. © The Foundation Acta Radiologica 2014.</p>"
719,2-s2.0-84929658089,"Differentiation and quantification of inflammation, demyelination and axon injury or loss in multiple sclerosis","<p>Axon injury/loss, demyelination and inflammation are the primary pathologies in multiple sclerosis lesions. Despite the prevailing notion that axon/neuron loss is the substrate of clinical progression of multiple sclerosis, the roles that these individual pathological processes play in multiple sclerosis progression remain to be defined. An imaging modality capable to effectively detect, differentiate and individually quantify axon injury/loss, demyelination and inflammation, would not only facilitate the understanding of the pathophysiology underlying multiple sclerosis progression, but also the assessment of treatments at the clinical trial and individual patient levels. In this report, the newly developed diffusion basis spectrum imaging was used to discriminate and quantify the underlying pathological components in multiple sclerosis white matter. Through the multiple-tensor modelling of diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging signals, diffusion basis spectrum imaging resolves inflammation-associated cellularity and vasogenic oedema in addition to accounting for partial volume effects resulting from cerebrospinal fluid contamination, and crossing fibres. Quantitative histological analysis of autopsied multiple sclerosis spinal cord specimens supported that diffusion basis spectrum imaging-determined cellularity, axon and myelin injury metrics closely correlated with those pathologies identified and quantified by conventional histological staining. We demonstrated in healthy control subjects that diffusion basis spectrum imaging rectified inaccurate assessments of diffusion properties of white matter tracts by diffusion tensor imaging in the presence of cerebrospinal fluid contamination and/or crossing fibres. In multiple sclerosis patients, we report that diffusion basis spectrum imaging quantitatively characterized the distinct pathologies underlying gadolinium-enhanced lesions, persistent black holes, non-enhanced lesions and non-black hole lesions, a task yet to be demonstrated by other neuroimaging approaches. Diffusion basis spectrum imaging-derived radial diffusivity (myelin integrity marker) and non-restricted isotropic diffusion fraction (oedema marker) correlated with magnetization transfer ratio, supporting previous reports that magnetization transfer ratio is sensitive not only to myelin integrity, but also to inflammation-associated oedema. Our results suggested that diffusion basis spectrum imaging-derived quantitative biomarkers are highly consistent with histology findings and hold promise to accurately characterize the heterogeneous white matter pathology in multiple sclerosis patients. Thus, diffusion basis spectrum imaging can potentially serve as a non-invasive outcome measure to assess treatment effects on the specific components of underlying pathology targeted by new multiple sclerosis therapies. © 2015 The Author (2015).

An optimal therapeutic strategy would be to stimulate remyelination while limiting demyelination. Although accumulation of myelin debris impairs remyelination, the mechanisms regulating the clearance of such debris by mononuclear phagocytic cells are poorly understood. We demonstrate that after cuprizone intoxication, CCR2-dependent infiltration of mouse bone marrow-derived cells is abundant in demyelinating areas, but that these cells do not impact demyelination. However, in CX3CR1-deficient mice, the clearance of myelin debris by microglia was blocked greatly, affecting the integrity of the axon and myelin sheaths and thus preventing proper remyelination. These results highlight the crucial role played by CX3CR1 in myelin removal and show that there can be no efficient remyelination after a primary demyelinating insult if myelin clearance by microglia is impaired. © 2015 Mantovani and Allavena.</p>"

723,2-s2.0-84939983363,Criteria improving multiple sclerosis diagnosis at the first MRI,"<p>The introduction of the McDonald criteria has enabled earlier diagnosis of multiple sclerosis (MS). However, even with the 2010 revised criteria, nearly 50 % of patients remain classified as “possible MS” following the first MRI. The present study aimed to demonstrate that time to MS diagnosis could be shorter than 2010 revised criteria, and established after a single early MRI in most patients with the association of the symptomatic lesion and at least one suggestive asymptomatic lesion. We also evaluated the short-term predictive capacity of an individual suggestive lesion on disease activity. We analyzed initial MRI results from 146 patients with MS from a multicenter retrospective study. Visualization of the symptomatic lesion was used as a primary criterion. Secondary criteria included one suggestive lesion (SL) aspect or topography on MRI, or one non-specific lesion associated with positive CSF. The proposed criteria led to a positive diagnosis of MS in 100 % of cases, from information available from the time of the first MRI for 145 patients (99.3 %). At least one SL was observed for 143 patients (97.9 %), and positive CSF for the 3 others. Compared to the McDonald criteria, the proposed criteria had 100 % sensitivity, with a significantly shorter mean time to reach a positive diagnosis. Furthermore, the simultaneous presence of corpus callosum, temporal horn, and ovoid lesions was associated with radiological or clinical activity after a year of follow-up. The proposed diagnostic criteria are easy to apply, have a good sensitivity, and allow an earlier diagnosis than the 2010 McDonald criteria. Nevertheless, prospective studies are needed to establish specificity and to confirm these findings. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.</p>"

Materials and Methods: By systematically searching online databases, tract-based spatial statistics studies were identified that compared fractional anisotropy (FA; a marker for WM integrity) in MS patients to healthy control subjects, correlated FA in MS patients with physical disability, or correlated FA in MS patients with cognitive performance. Voxelwise metaanalysis was performed by using the Signed Differential Mapping method for each comparison. Moderating effects of mean age, mean physical disability score, imager magnet strength, lesion load, and number of diffusion directions were assessed by means of meta-regression. Results: Meta-analysis was performed on data from 495 patients and 253 control subjects across 12 studies. MS diagnosis was significantly associated with widespread lower tract FA (nine studies; largest cluster, 4379 voxels; z = 7.1; P &lt;.001). Greater physical disability was significantly associated with lower FA in the right posterior cingulum, left callosal splenium, right inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, and left fornix crus (six studies; 323 voxels; z = 1.7; P =.001). Impaired cognition was significantly associated with lower FA in the callosal genu, thalamus, right posterior cingulum, and fornix crus (seven studies; largest cluster, 980 voxels; z = 2.5; P &lt;.001). Conclusion: WM damage is widespread in MS with differential and only minimally overlapping distributions of low FA that relates to physical disability and cognitive impairment. The higher number of clusters of lower FA in relation to cognition and their higher z scores suggest that cerebral WM damage may have a greater relevance to cognitive dysfunction than physical disability in MS, and that low anterior callosal and thalamic FA have specific importance to cognitive status. © RSNA, 2015.</p>"
726,2-s2.0-84922790243,TIP30 inhibits oligodendrocyte precursor cell differentiation via cytoplasmic sequestration of olig1,"<p>Differentiation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) is a prerequisite for both developmental myelination and adult remyelination in the central nervous system. The molecular mechanisms underlying OPC differentiation remain largely unknown. Here, we show that the thirty-kDa HIV-1 Tat interacting protein (TIP30) is a negative regulator in oligodendrocyte development. The TIP30<sup>-/-</sup> mice displayed an increased myelin protein level at postnatal day 14 and 21. By using a primary OPC culture system, we demonstrated that overexpression of TIP30 dramatically inhibited the stage progression of differentiating OPCs, while knockdown of TIP30 enhanced the differentiation of oligodendroglial cells remarkably. Moreover, overexpression of TIP30 was found to sequester the transcription factor Olig1 in the cytoplasm and weaken its nuclear translocation due to the interaction between TIP30 and Olig1, whereas knockdown of TIP30 led to more Olig1 localized in the nucleus in the initiation stage during OPC differentiation. In the cuprizone-induced demyelination model, there was a dramatic increase in NG2-expressing cells with nuclear location of Olig1 in the corpus callosum during remyelination. In contrast, within chronic demyelinated lesions in multiple sclerosis, TIP30 was abnormally expressed in NG2-expressing cells, and few nuclear Olig1 was observed in these cells. Taken together, our findings suggest that TIP30 plays a negative regulatory role in oligodendroglial differentiation. GLIA 2015;63:684-698 Main Points: TIP30 inhibited OPC differentiation via cytoplasmic sequestration of Olig1. TIP30 was abnormally expressed in NG2-positive OPCs within chronic demyelinated lesions in multiple sclerosis but not in the cuprizone-induced demyelination mode. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p>"
727,2-s2.0-84923641072,Reduction in serum aquaporin-4 antibody titers during development of a tumor-like brain lesion in a patient with neuromyelitis optica: A serum antibody-consuming effect?,"<p>Neuromyelitis optica (NMO) is an inflammatory demyelinating disease of the CNS with severe involvement of the optic nerve and spinal cord. Highly specific serum IgG autoantibodies (NMO-IgG) that react with aquaporin-4 (AQP4), the most abundant CNS water channel protein, are found in patients with NMO. However, in vivo evidence combining the results of AQP4 antibody serum levels and brain pathology is lacking. We report a patient with NMO whose AQP4 antibody levels decreased simultaneously with clinical deterioration caused by the development of a tumor-like brain lesion. In the seminecrotic biopsied brain lesion, there was activated complement complex, whereas only very scattered immunoreactivity to AQP4 protein was detectable. The decrease in serum AQP4 antibody levels and the loss of AQP4 in the tumor-like lesion could represent a ""serum antibody-consuming effect"" during lesion formation. © 2015 by the American Association of Neuropathologists, Inc.</p>"

We investigate CD4+ T-cell cytokine profiles and subpopulations in 19-year-old monozygotic twins with autism and different comorbidities. CD4+ T cells from the twin with epilepsy produce more interferon-gamma, less interleukin-17, and have an increased interferon-γ/interleukin-4 ratio. CD4+ T cells from the twin with multiple sclerosis exhibit a cytokine profile similar to an age and gender-matched control and a higher percentage of T regulatory (Treg) cells. The twins' mother's T cells produce very high levels of both interleukin-17 and interferon-γ. Cytokine and CD4+ T-cell abnormalities in the twins could contribute to or be a result of the manifestation of their divergent comorbidities.

729,2-s2.0-84937896814,Alteration of synaptic connectivity of oligodendrocyte precursor cells following demyelination,"<p>Oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) are a major source of remyelinating oligodendrocytes in demyelinating diseases such as Multiple Sclerosis (MS). While OPCs are innervated by unmyelinated axons in the normal brain, the fate of such synaptic contacts after demyelination is still unclear. By combining electrophysiology and immunostainings in different transgenic mice expressing fluorescent reporters, we studied the synaptic innervation of OPCs in the model of lysolecithin (LPC)-induced demyelination of corpus callosum. Synaptic innervation of reactivated OPCs in the lesion was revealed by the presence of AMPA receptor-mediated synaptic currents, VGluT1+ axon-OPC contacts in 3D confocal reconstructions and synaptic junctions observed by electron microscopy. Moreover, 3D confocal reconstructions of VGluT1 and NG2 immunolabeling showed the existence of glutamatergic axon-OPC contacts in post-mortem MS lesions. Interestingly, patch-clamp recordings in LPC-induced lesions demonstrated a drastic decrease in spontaneous synaptic activity of OPCs early after demyelination that was not caused by an impaired conduction of compound action potentials. A reduction in synaptic connectivity was confirmed by the lack of VGluT1+ axon-OPC contacts in virtually all rapidly proliferating OPCs stained with EdU (50-ethynyl-20-deoxyuridine). At the end of the massive proliferation phase in lesions, the proportion of innervated OPCs rapidly recovers, although the frequency of spontaneous synaptic currents did not reach control levels. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that newly-generated OPCs do not receive synaptic inputs during their active proliferation after demyelination, but gain synapses during the remyelination process. Hence, glutamatergic synaptic inputs may contribute to inhibit OPC proliferation and might have a physiopathological relevance in demyelinating disorders. © 2015 Sahel, Ortiz, Kerninon, Maldonado, Angulo and Nait-Oumesmar.</p>"

Effect on instrumental activities of daily living and employment status,"<p>Introduction Cognitive impairment is an important predictor of quality of life at all stages of MS. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) markers have been used to associate tissue damage with cognitive dysfunction. Objective The aim of the study was to designate the MRI marker that predicts cognitive decline and explore its effect on every day activities and employment status. Methods 50 RRMS patients and 31 healthy participants underwent neuropsychological assessment using the Trail Making Test (TMT) parts A and B, semantic and phonological verbal fluency task and a computerized cognitive screening battery (Central Nervous System Vital Signs). Everyday activities were evaluated with the instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) scale and employment status. Brain MRI was performed in all participants. We measured total lesion volume, third ventricle width, corpus callosum and thalamic atrophy. Results The frequency of cognitive dysfunction for our RRMS patients was 38%. RRMS patients differed significantly from controls on the TMTA, TMTB, phonological verbal fluency task, memory, psychomotor speed, reaction time and cognitive flexibility. Neuropsychological measures had a strong correlation with all MRI atrophy measures and a weak or moderate correlation with lesion volume. Psychomotor speed was the most sensitive marker for IADL, while memory and TMTB for employment status. Thalamic area was the most sensitive MRI marker for memory, psychomotor speed and TMTB. Conclusion Thalamic atrophy predicts the clinically meaningful cognitive decline in our RRMS patients. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.</p>"

The present study was designed to determine the effect of epimedium flavonoids (EF), the main component extracted from Epimedium sagittatum, on CPZ-induced neuropathological changes in the corpus callosum of C57BL/6 mice. Once we determined an EF-based protective effect on the corpus callosum, we sought to explore the underlying mechanism of this protection. To induce demyelination, 8-week-old mice were fed with 0.2 % CPZ for a maximum period of 6 weeks. EF treatment for a period of 3 weeks effectively decreased the breakdown of myelin, OL loss, and oligodendrocyte precursor cell accumulation in CPZ-fed mice. In addition, EF administration significantly increased the cortical expression level of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1). This study provides the first in vivo evidence of EF-based protection against CPZ-induced neuropathological changes. Furthermore, our study suggests that upregulated IGF-1 may play a role in this protection. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.</p>"

Objective To evaluate the contribution of asymptomatic gadolinium-enhancing lesions to cognitive dysfunction along with gray-matter damage and callosal atrophy in relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) patients. Methods Forty-two treated RRMS and 30 controls were evaluated. MRI (3 T) variables of interest were brain white-matter and cortical lesion load, cortical and deep gray-matter volumes, corpus callosum volume and presence of gadolinium-enhancing lesions. Outcome variables included EDSS, MS Functional Composite (MSFC) subtests and the Brief Repeatable Battery of Neuropsychological tests. Cognitive dysfunction was classified as deficits in two or more cognitive subtests. Multivariate regression analyses assessed the contribution of MRI metrics to outcomes. Results Patients with cognitive impairment (45.2%) had more cortical lesions and lower gray-matter and callosal volumes. Patients with subclinical MRI activity (15%) had worse cognitive performance. Clinical disability on MSFC was mainly associated with putaminal atrophy. The main independent predictors for cognitive deficits were high burden of cortical lesions and number of gadolinium-enhancing lesions. Conclusions Cognitive dysfunction was especially related to high burden of cortical lesions and subclinical disease activity. Cognitive studies in MS should look over subclinical disease activity as a potential contributor to cognitive impairment. © 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.</p>"

A study was performed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of gadobutrol-enhanced versus unenhanced imaging for central nervous system (CNS) lesion visualization and detection. Materials and Methods: An international, multicenter, open-label, Phase III clinical trial. Patients underwent unenhanced and gadobutrol 1.0 M-enhanced (0.1 mmol/kg BW) MR imaging using a standardized protocol. Unenhanced and combined unenhanced/gadobutrol-enhanced images were scored by three independent, blinded readers for degree of lesion enhancement, border delineation, internal morphology, and total number of lesions detected (primary efficacy variables). Exact match of the MR diagnoses with the final clinical diagnosis, detection of malignant CNS lesions, and confidence in diagnosis were secondary efficacy variables. Results: Of 343 enrolled patients, 321 were evaluated for efficacy. All primary efficacy endpoints were met: superiority was demonstrated for gadobutrol-enhanced versus unenhanced MR images (P &lt; 0.0001 in all cases) for lesion enhancement, border delineation, and internal morphology. Noninferiority was met for mean number of lesions detected. There were improvements in the sensitivity of malignant lesion detection, without a loss in specificity, exact-match diagnostic accuracy, and reader confidence.

735,2-s2.0-84922265163,Short-Term Cuprizone Feeding Verifies N-Acetylaspartate Quantification as a Marker of Neurodegeneration,"<p>Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) is a quantitative MR imaging technique often used to complement conventional MR imaging with specific metabolic information. A key metabolite is the amino acid derivative N-Acetylaspartate (NAA) which is an accepted marker to measure the extent of neurodegeneration in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. NAA is catabolized by the enzyme aspartoacylase (ASPA) which is predominantly expressed in oligodendrocytes. Since the formation of MS lesions is paralleled by oligodendrocyte loss, NAA might accumulate in the brain, and therefore, the extent of neurodegeneration might be underestimated. In the present study, we used the well-characterized cuprizone model. There, the loss of oligodendrocytes is paralleled by a reduction in ASPA expression and activity as demonstrated by genome-wide gene expression analysis and enzymatic activity assays. Notably, brain levels of NAA were not increased as determined by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry and 1H-MRS. These important findings underpin the reliability of NAA quantification as a valid marker for the paraclinical determination of the extent of neurodegeneration, even under conditions of oligodendrocyte loss in which impaired metabolization of NAA is expected. Future studies have to reveal whether other enzymes are able to metabolize NAA or whether an excess of NAA is cleared by other mechanisms rather than enzymatic metabolism. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.</p>"

This is a case–control study including a series of 31 patients with clinically definite MS. The mean age was 39 years [standard deviation (SD) = 9.55], they were 11 males and 20 females, with a disease duration average of 3 years (range 0–13) and a median EDSS of 2 (0–4.5). Seventeen healthy volunteers (6 males and 11 females) with a mean age of 36 years (SD = 11.4) were recruited. All subjects underwent MR imaging on a 3T scanner using T2-weighted sequence, 3D T1 MPRAGE, MFC, single-shot DTI and post-contrast T1. T2-lesion volumes, brain volumetry, DTI parameters and iron quantification were calculated and multiple correlations were exploited. Increased MFC was found in the putamen (p = 0.061), the thalamus (p = 0.123), the centrum semiovale (p = 0.053), globus pallidus (p = 0.008) and gray matter (GM) (p = 0.004) of MS patients compared to controls. The mean lesional MFC was 121 s<sup>−2</sup> (SD = 67), significantly lower compared to the GM MFC (&lt;0.0001). The GM mean diffusivity (MD) was inversely correlated with the MFC in the centrum semiovale (p &lt; 0.001), and in the splenium of the corpus callosum (p &lt; 0.001). Patients with MS have increased iron in the globus pallidus, putamen and centrum with a trend toward increased iron in all the brain structures. Quantitative iron evaluation of WM and GM may improve the understanding of MS pathophysiology, and might serve as a surrogate marker of disease progression. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.</p>"

740,2-s2.0-85006783286,Magnetic resonance imaging as a major milestone in multiple sclerosis diagnosis and treatment,"<p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has played a unique role in the diagnosis and management of patients with MS. In recent years, there have been considerable changes in the diagnostic criteria for MS as MRI-based studies have demonstrated their power in the earlier and more accurate diagnosis of the disease. Moreover, MRI metrics have become key supportive outcome measures for evaluating the efficacy of experimental treatments in randomized controlled trials. MRI can also be used as a prognostic tool in patients with clinically isolated syndrome (CIS). Conventional MR techniques including proton density, T1/T2-weighted images, and FLAIR sequences are now accepted in standard protocols for diagnostic and treatment outcome measures in clinical trials for MS. Radiological features may show a similarity between radiologically isolated syndrome and MS. Approximately two-thirds of individuals with RIS exhibit radiological progression and one-third develop neurological symptoms during mean follow-up times of up to five years. However, a current challenge in the global application of established criteria for RIS involves the accurate classification of subjects with incidentally identified anomalies that are highly characteristic of MS, in comparison to those categorized in medical parlance as possessing “unidentified bright objects” or nonspecific T2-hyperintensities, which are commonly identified in patients with migraine headache who fulfill the spatial dissemination requirements for MS. The need for systematically acquired data for improvements in the classification of radiologically isolated syndrome (RIS) and the generation of risk algorithms are critically important, providing a basis for scientifically supported management and most importantly, minimizing the number of improperly classified subjects exposed to unnecessary medical testing, MS treatments, and psychological harm. In addition, brain atrophy is a common finding that can now be quantitatively assessed by MR volumetric measures. Further, integrated strategies that combine MRI and clinical markers in scoring systems have provided a potentially useful approach for the management of patients with MS. © 2015 by Turkish Association of Neuropsychiatry.</p>"
741,2-s2.0-84969667861,In vivo histology of the myelin g-ratio with magnetic resonance imaging,"<p>The myelin g-ratio, defined as the ratio between the inner and the outer diameter of the myelin sheath, is a fundamental property of white matter that can be computed from a simple formula relating the myelin volume fraction to the fiber volume fraction or the axon volume fraction. In this paper, a unique combination of magnetization transfer, diffusion imaging and histology is presented, providing a novel method for in vivo magnetic resonance imaging of the axon volume fraction and the myelin g-ratio. Our method was demonstrated in the corpus callosum of one cynomolgus macaque, and applied to obtain full-brain g-ratio maps in one healthy human subject and one multiple sclerosis patient. In the macaque, the g-ratio was relatively constant across the corpus callosum, as measured by both MRI and electron microscopy. In the human subjects, the g-ratio in multiple sclerosis lesions was higher than in normal appearing white matter, which was in turn higher than in healthy white matter. Measuring the g-ratio brings us one step closer to fully characterizing white matter non-invasively, making it possible to perform in vivo histology of the human brain during development, aging, disease and treatment. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.</p>"
742,2-s2.0-84960446833,Thyroid hormone alleviates demyelination induced by cuprizone through its role in remyelination during the remission period,"<p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a disease induced by demyelination in the central nervous system, and the remission period of MS is crucial for remyelination. In addition, abnormal levels of thyroid hormone (TH) have been identified in MS. However, in the clinic, insufficient attention has been paid to the role of TH in the remission period. Indeed, TH not only functions in the development of the brain but also affects myelination. Therefore, it is necessary to observe the effect of TH on remyelination during this period. A model of demyelination induced by cuprizone (CPZ) was used to observe the function of TH in remyelination during the remission period of MS. Through weighing and behavioral tests, we found that TH improved the physical symptoms of mice impaired by CPZ. Supplementation of TH led to the repair of myelin as detected by immunohistochemistry and western blot. In addition, a sufficient TH supply resulted in an increase in myelinated axons without affecting myelin thickness and g ratio in the corpus callosum, as detected by electron microscopy. Double immunostaining with myelin basic protein and neurofilament 200 (NF200) showed that the CPZ-induced impairment of axons was alleviated by TH. Conversely, insufficient TH induced by 6-propyl-2- thiouracil resulted in the enlargement of mitochondria. Furthermore, we found that an adequate supply of TH promoted the proliferation and differentiation of oligodendrocyte lineage cells by immunofluorescence, which was beneficial to remyelination. Further, we found that TH reduced the number of astrocytes without affecting microglia. Conclusively, it was shown that TH alleviated demyelination induced by CPZ by promoting the development of oligodendrocyte lineage cells and remyelination. The critical time for remyelination is the remission period of MS. TH plays a significant role in alleviating demyelination during the remission period in the clinical treatment of MS. © 2015 by the Society for Experimental Biology and Medicine.</p>"
743,2-s2.0-84951799688,Corpus callosum segmentation in MS studies using normal atlases and optimal hybridization of extrinsic and intrinsic image cues,"<p>The corpus callosum (CC) is a key brain structure and change in its size and shape is a focal point in the study of neurodegenerative diseases like multiple sclerosis (MS). A number of automatic methods have been proposed for CC segmentation in magnetic resonance images (MRIs) that can be broadly classified as intensity-based and template-based. Imaging artifacts and signal changes due to pathology often cause errors in intensity-based methods. Template-based methods have been proposed to alleviate these problems. However, registration inaccuracies (local mismatch) can occur when the template image has large intensity and morphological differences from the scan to be segmented, such as when using publicly available normal templates for a diseased population. Accordingly, we propose a novel hybrid segmentation framework that performs optimal, spatially variant fusion of multi-atlas-based and intensity-based priors. Our novel coupled graph-labeling formulation effectively optimizes, on a per-voxel basis, the weights that govern the choice of priors so that intensity priors derived from the subject image are emphasized when spatial priors derived from the registered templates are deemed less trustworthy. This stands in contrast to existing hybrid methods that either ignore local registration errors or alternate between the optimization of fusion weights and segmentation results in an expectation maximization fashion. We evaluated our method using a public dataset and two large in-house MS datasets and found that it gave more accurate results than those achieved by existing methods for CC segmentation. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.</p>"

Her left visual acuity was 0.07 and an ophthalmoscopic examination demonstrated bilateral intermediate uveitis (IU). A neurological examination on admission revealed lower nasal quadrantanopsia in her left eye and an exaggerated right patellar tendon reflex. A T2- weighted MRI showed multiple high-intensity lesions in the bilateral periventricular region, corpus callosum, medulla. A short T1 inversion recovery MRI also showed a swollen left retrobulbar optic nerve and posterior thoracic cord lesion at Th 9 level. The latter longitudinal length was approximately 20 mm. Laboratory investigation demonstrated no abnormalities including an anti-aquaporin-4 antibody. A cerebrospinal fluid examination revealed an increased IgG-index (1.21) with oligoclonal IgG babds. Initially, a diagnosis of retrobulbar optic neuritis with IU was made. She received subtenon corticosteroid injection with intravenous methylprednisolone pulse and oral prednisolone therapy. An immediate improvement of her visual symptoms and MRI abnormalities was observed. Approximately 1 year later, a new high-intensity lesion in the right internal capsule was present on a follow-up T2-weighted brain MRI, established a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis (MS) based on the McDonald criteria in 2010. Previous reports in Japan demonstrated few cases of uveitis in patients with MS and this is the first report of MS with IU in Japan.</p>"
746,2-s2.0-84945133864,Brain and cord myelin water imaging: A progressive multiple sclerosis biomarker,"<p>Objectives Conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is used to diagnose and monitor inflammatory disease in relapsing remitting (RR) multiple sclerosis (MS). In the less common primary progressive (PP) form of MS, in which focal inflammation is less evident, biomarkers are still needed to enable evaluation of novel therapies in clinical trials. Our objective was to characterize the association - across the brain and cervical spinal cord - between clinical disability measures in PPMS and two potential biomarkers (one for myelin, and one for atrophy, both resulting from the same imaging technique). Methods Multi-component driven equilibrium single pulse observation of T1 and T2 (mcDESPOT) MRI of the brain and cervical spinal cord were obtained for 15 PPMS patients and 11 matched controls. Data were analysed to estimate the signal related to myelin water (VF<sub>M</sub>), as well as volume measurements. MS disability was assessed using the Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite score, which includes measures of cognitive processing (Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test), manual dexterity (9-Hole Peg Test) and ambulatory function (Timed 25-Foot Walk); and the Expanded Disability Status Scale. Results Brain and spinal cord volumes were different in PPMS compared to controls, particularly ventricular (+ 46%, p = 0.0006) and cervical spinal cord volume (- 16%, p = 0.0001). Brain and spinal cord myelin (VF<sub>M</sub>) were also reduced in PPMS (brain: - 11%, p = 0.01; spine: - 19%, p = 0.000004). Cognitive processing correlated with brain ventricular volume (p = 0.009). Manual dexterity correlated with brain ventricular volume (p = 0.007), and both brain and spinal cord VF<sub>M</sub> (p = 0.01 and 0.06, respectively). Ambulation correlated with spinal cord volume (p = 0.04) and spinal cord VF<sub>M</sub> (p = 0.04). Interpretation In this study we demonstrated that mcDESPOT can be used to measure myelin and atrophy in the brain and spinal cord. Results correlate well with clinical disability scores in PPMS representing cognitive, fine motor and ambulatory disability. © 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.</p>"

Regeneration of myelin sheath stimulates axon regeneration and neurons’ survival. In this study, olfactory ensheathing cell (OEC) transplantation is investigated to restore myelin sheath in an experimental model of MS in male mice.OECs were isolated from the olfactory mucosa of seven-day-old infant rats and cultured. Then, cells were evaluated and approved by flow cytometry by p75 and GFAP markers. A total of 32 mice (C57BL /6) were studied in four groups; 1) without any treatment (control), 2) Sham (receiving PBS), 3) MS model and 4) MS and OEC transplantation. MS was induced by adding Cuprizon in the diet of animals for six weeks. After the expiration of 20 days, histologic analysis was performed with approval of the presence of cells in the graft area and the removal of myelin and myelin regeneration with two types of luxal fast blue (LFB) staining and immunohistochemistry. The purity of the cells ensheathing the olfactory was 90%. There was a significant difference in Myelin percentage of PBS and OEC recipient groups (P≤0.05). MBP and PLP of the myelin sheath in the group receiving OECs were more than MS group.According to the findings, in MS model MBP and PLP of the myelin sheath is reduced. In the group receiving OECs, it was returned to a normal level significantly compared to the sham group received only PBS significant differences were observed. The OECs transplantation can improve myelin restoration. © 2015 Tehran University of Medical Sciences. All rights reserved.</p>"

749,2-s2.0-84926632552,Linear modeling of multiple sclerosis and its subgroubs,"<p>Objective: In this study,120 patients diagnosed with clinical multiple sclerosis (MS) of relapsing remitting type (RRMS), secondary progressive type (SPMS) and primary progressive type (PPMS) were examined, as well as 19 healthy subjects. All subjects were between the ages of 20 and 55. Disability levels of MS symptoms were determined using Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS). We focused on three regions in the brain, brain stem, periventricular corpus callosum, and upper cervical regions EDSS scores and number of lesions in these three regions are considered as the parameters of the linear mathematical model to determine the subgroups of the disease. Materials and Methods: Initially, the distinction between healthy subjects and patients was made. Then, if the subject was determined to have MS, the distinction of type, i.e. RRMS, SPMS/PPMS, and later, RRMS/SPMS distinction was made. In all determinations linear models were used and number of lesions in the specified three regions and EDSS scores were assumed as the parameters of the model. The coefficients of the models were obtained by least squares method. Results: In the linear model attached to MR parameters, there was 100% success for distinction of patients and healthy subjects. Success for distinction of RRMS and SPMS/PPMS patients and RRMS/SPMS patients was 94% and 78.94%, respectively is attained. Based on EDSS scores, linear model provides 99% success in the distinction between patients and healthy subjects. In the models created for the distinction between groups, success rate was 94% was for RRMS-SPMS/PPMS and 64% for RRMS/SPMS. Conclusion: The correlation of MS diagnosis using various features obtained from MR images and EDSS scores with subgroups of the disease and the possibility of developing a linear model were determined. Using the features having the highest correlation rate, various linear models were developed and high success was achieved. © 2015, Turkish Neurological Society. All rights reserved.</p>"
750,2-s2.0-84924891315,Pharmaceutical integrated stress response enhancement protects oligodendrocytes and provides a potential multiple sclerosis therapeutic,"<p>Oligodendrocyte death contributes to the pathogenesis of the inflammatory demyelinating disease multiple sclerosis (MS). Nevertheless, current MS therapies are mainly immunomodulatory and have demonstrated limited ability to inhibit MS progression. Protection of oligodendrocytes is therefore a desirable strategy for alleviating disease. Here we demonstrate that enhancement of the integrated stress response using the FDA-approved drug guanabenz increases oligodendrocyte survival in culture and prevents hypomyelination in cerebellar explants in the presence of interferon-γ, a pro-inflammatory cytokine implicated in MS pathogenesis. In vivo, guanabenz treatment protects against oligodendrocyte loss caused by CNS-specific expression of interferon-γ. In a mouse model of MS, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, guanabenz alleviates clinical symptoms, which correlates with increased oligodendrocyte survival and diminished CNS CD4+ T cell accumulation. Moreover, guanabenz ameliorates relapse in relapsing-remitting experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Our results provide support for a MS therapy that enhances the integrated stress response to protect oligodendrocytes against the inflammatory CNS environment. © 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

In 13 healthy volunteers and 20 mildly disabled, relapsing-remitting MS patients, we examined simple reaction time (SRT) tasks requiring sensorimotor integration in circuits involving the corpus callosum and the brain stem. A somatosensory stimulus was used as the imperative signal (IS), and subjects were requested to react with either the ipsilateral or the contralateral hand (uncrossed vs. crossed SRT). In 33% of trials, a startling auditory stimulus was presented together with the IS, and the percentage reaction time change with respect to baseline SRT trials was measured (StartReact effect). The difference between crossed and uncrossed SRT, which requires interhemispheric conduction, was significantly larger in patients than in healthy subjects (P = 0.021). The StartReact effect, which involves activation of brain stem motor pathways, was reduced significantly in patients with respect to healthy subjects (uncrossed trials: P = 0.015; crossed trials: P = 0.005). In patients, a barely significant correlation was found between SRT delay and conduction abnormalities in motor and sensory pathways (P = 0.02 and P = 0.04, respectively). The abnormalities found specifically in trials reflecting interhemispheric transfer of information, as well as the evidence for reduced subcortical motor preparation, indicate that a delay in reaction time execution in MS patients cannot be explained solely by conduction slowing in motor and sensory pathways but suggest, instead, defective sensorimotor integration mechanisms in at least the two circuits examined. © 2015 the American Physiological Society.</p>"

Glucocorticoid treatment was immediately initiated. The disease and the demyelinating lesions progressed during the following 9 years reaching Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) 8.0 (patient essentially restricted to bed, a chair or perambulated in a wheelchair). At this point, the patient began taking melatonin at doses ranging from 50 to 300 mg per day. Melatonin was her only treatment for the next 4 years; during this interval, her EDSS progressively recovered to 6.0 (the person needs intermittent or unilateral constant assistance such as cane, crutch, or brace to walk 100 meters with or without resting). This long-lasting improvement is likely due to melatonin usage since it is related in time and because of its exceptionally long duration. © 2014 John Wiley &amp; Sons A/S.

However, the pathology of axonal damage in MS is not fully understood. In this study, histological analysis of morphological changes of axonal organelles during demyelination in murine models was investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) using an osmium-maceration method. In cuprizone-induced demyelination, SEM showed typical morphology of demyelination in the corpus callosum of mouse brain. In contrast, SEM displayed variations in ultrastructural abnormalities of myelin structures and axonal organelles in spinal cord white matter of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mice, an animal model of MS. Myelin detachment and excessive myelin formation were observed as typical morphological myelin abnormalities in EAE. In addition, well-developed axoplasmic reticulum-like structures and accumulated mitochondria were observed in tortuous degenerating/degenerated axons and the length of mitochondria in axons of EAE spinal cord was shorter compared with naïve spinal cord. Immunohistochemistry also revealed dysfunction of mitochondrial fusion/fission machinery in EAE spinal cord axons. Moreover, the number of Y-shaped mitochondria was significantly increased in axons of the EAE spinal cord. Axonal morphologies in myelin basic protein-deficient shiverer mice were similar to those in EAE. However, shiverer mice had ""tortuous"" (S-curve shaped mitochondria) and larger mitochondria compared with wild-type and EAE mice. Lastly, analysis of human MS patient autopsied brains also demonstrated abnormal myelin structures in demyelinating lesions. These results indicate that morphological abnormalities of myelin and axonal organelles play important role on the pathogenesis of axonal injury in demyelinating diseases. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.</p>"
754,2-s2.0-84921526817,Oligodendroglial maturation is dependent on intracellular protein shuttling,"<p>Multiple sclerosis is an autoimmune disease of the CNS resulting in degeneration of myelin sheaths and loss of oligodendrocytes, which means that protection and electrical insulation of axons and rapid signal propagation are impaired, leading to axonal damage and permanent disabilities. Partial replacement of lost oligodendrocytes and remyelination can occur as a result of activation and recruitment of resident oligodendroglial precursor cells. However, the overall remyelination capacity remains inefficient because precursor cells often fail to generate new oligodendrocytes. Increasing evidence points to the existence of several molecular inhibitors that act on these cells and interfere with their cellular maturation. The p57kip2 gene encodes one such potent inhibitor of oligodendroglial differentiation and this study sheds light on the underlying mode of action. We found that subcellular distribution of the p57kip2 protein changed during differentiation of rat, mouse, and human oligodendroglial cells both in vivo and in vitro. Nuclear export of p57kip2 was correlated with promoted myelin expression, higher morphological phenotypes, and enhanced myelination in vitro. In contrast, nuclear accumulation of p57kip2 resulted in blocked oligodendroglial differentiation. Experimental evidence suggests that the inhibitory role of p57kip2 depends on specific interactions with binding proteins such as LIMK-1, CDK2, Mashl, and Hes5 either by controlling their site of action or their activity. Because functional restoration in demyelinating diseases critically depends on the successful generation of oligodendroglial cells, a therapeutic need that is currently unmet, the regulatory mechanism described here might be of particular interest for identifying suitable drug targets and devising novel therapeutic approaches. © 2015 the authors.</p>"
755,2-s2.0-84920909935,Corpus Callosum Atrophy Correlates with Gray Matter Atrophy in Patients with Multiple Sclerosis,"<p>OBJECTIVE: Atrophy of the corpus callosum is a recognized characteristic of multiple sclerosis (MS). We describe a new reliable method for measuring corpus callosum atrophy and correlate this with global cerebral atrophy measures. METHODS: Whole brain 3T MRI was performed in 38 relapsing-remitting MS subjects and 21 healthy controls (HC). Brain global gray and white matter volumes were segmented with SPM8. The contour of the corpus callosum was outlined on the midline of 3-D T1-weighted images by a semiautomated edge-detection technique to determine the corpus callosum area (CCA). Normalized CCA was correlated with other brain atrophy measures in MS subjects. RESULTS: CCA was disproportionately lower in MS subjects vs. HC (20.1% mean decrease; P &lt; .001), with a large effect size (d = .62) when compared with global atrophy measures. In MS subjects, CCA correlated with brain parenchymal fraction (r = .55; P &lt; .001) and gray matter fraction (r = .45; P = .005) but not white matter fraction (r = .18; P = .29). An inverse correlation with FLAIR hyperintense lesion volume (r = -.40; P = .01) was detected for CCA. CONCLUSION: Measurement of atrophy of the corpus callosum can have sensitivity as a useful imaging biomarker in patients with MS, even in patients with low disability levels. Both gray and white matter involvement in MS contribute to corpus callosum atrophy. © 2014 by the American Society of Neuroimaging.</p>"
756,2-s2.0-84920622579,Integrity of hypothalamic fibers and cognitive fatigue in multiple sclerosis,"<p>Cognitive fatigue is a common and disabling symptom of multiple sclerosis (MS), but little is known about its pathophysiology. The present study investigated whether the posterior hypothalamus, which is considered as the waking center, is associated with MS-related cognitive fatigue. We analyzed the integrity of posterior hypothalamic fibers in 49 patients with relapsing-remitting MS and 14 healthy controls. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) parameters were calculated for fibers between the posterior hypothalamus and, respectively, the mesencephalon, pons and prefrontal cortex. In addition, DTI parameters were computed for fibers between the anterior hypothalamus and these regions and for the corpus callosum. Cognitive fatigue was assessed using the Fatigue Scale for Motor and Cognitive Functions. Analyses of variance with repeated measures were performed to investigate the impact of cognitive fatigue on diffusion parameters. Cognitively fatigued patients (75.5%) showed a significantly lower mean axial and radial diffusivity for fibers between the posterior hypothalamus and the mesencephalon than cognitively non-fatigued patients (Group<sup>∗</sup>Target area<sup>∗</sup>Diffusion orientation: F=4.047; p=0.023). For fibers of the corpus callosum, MS patients presented significantly higher axial and radial diffusivity than healthy controls (Group<sup>∗</sup>Diffusion orientation: F=9.904; p&lt;0.001). Depressive mood, used as covariate, revealed significant interaction effects for anterior hypothalamic fibers (Target area<sup>∗</sup>Diffusion orientation<sup>∗</sup>Depression: F=5.882; p=0.021; Hemisphere<sup>∗</sup>Diffusion orientation<sup>∗</sup> Depression: F=8.744; p=0.008). Changes in integrity of fibers between the posterior hypothalamus and the mesencephalon appear to be associated with MS-related cognitive fatigue. These changes might cause an altered modulation of hypothalamic centers responsible for wakefulness. Furthermore, integrity of anterior hypothalamic fibers might be related to depression in MS. ©2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.</p>"

Here, we evaluated the potential of an agonist at this receptor, FTY720 (fingolimod), to activate the promyelinating pathways within the brain to encourage remyelination and neuroprotection. Experimental Approach In this study, we used the cuprizone model in male C57BL/6 mice and tested the promyelinating and neuroprotective effects of FTY720 after acute and chronic toxin-induced experimental demyelination. We used histological, immunohistochemical and gene expression methods. Key Results The midline of the corpus callosum was severely demyelinated after acute and chronic cuprizone-induced demyelination. Robust endogenous remyelination was evident after acute, but impaired after chronic, demyelination. FTY720 treatment modestly accelerated myelin recovery after acute but not chronic cuprizone exposure. Markers of gliosis (astrocyte and microglia activation) were not affected by FTY720 treatment. Remarkably, the accumulation of amyloid precursor protein-positive spheroids in axons was less distinct in FTY720-treated animals, indicating that this compound alleviated ongoing axonal damage. Conclusions and Implications We show that even during endogenous remyelination, axonal degeneration continued at a low level, accumulating over time. This continuous neurodegenerative process was ameliorated by FTY720 treatment. FTY720 preserved CNS integrity by direct interaction with brain resident cells, the actions of which are still to be defined. © 2014 The British Pharmacological Society.</p>"

Current therapies are limited to immunomodulators and antiinflammatory drugs, but there is no efficient treatment for stimulating the endogenous capacity of myelin repair. Progesterone and synthetic progestins have been shown in animal models of demyelination to attenuate myelin loss, reduce clinical symptoms severity, modulate inflammatory responses and partially reverse the age-dependent decline in remyelination. Moreover, progesterone has been demonstrated to promote myelin formation in organotypic cultures of cerebellar slices. In the present study, we show that progesterone and the synthetic 19-nor-progesterone derivative Nestorone® promote the repair of severe chronic demyelinating lesions induced by feeding cuprizone to female mice for up to 12 weeks. Progesterone and Nestorone increase the density of NG2<sup>+</sup> oligodendrocyte progenitor cells and CA II<sup>+</sup> mature oligodendrocytes and enhance the formation of myelin basic protein (MBP)- and proteolipid protein (PLP)-immunoreactive myelin. However, while demyelination in response to cuprizone was less marked in corpus callosum than in cerebral cortex, remyelination appeared earlier in the former. The remyelinating effect of progesterone was progesterone receptor (PR)-dependent, as it was absent in PR-knockout mice. Progesterone and Nestorone also decreased (but did not suppress) neuroinflammatory responses, specifically astrocyte and microglial cell activation. Therefore, some progestogens are promising therapeutic candidates for promoting the regeneration of myelin. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p>"
760,2-s2.0-84911925338,The relationship between regional microstructural abnormalities of the corpus callosum and physical and cognitive disability in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis,"<p>Significant corpus callosum (CC) involvement has been found in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS), even if conventional magnetic resonance imaging measures have shown poor correlation with clinical disability measures. In this work, we tested the potential of multimodal imaging of the entire CC to explain physical and cognitive disability in 47 patients with RRMS. Values of thickness, fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) were extracted from 50 regions of interest (ROIs) sampled along the bundle. The relationships between clinical, neuropsychological and imaging variables were assessed by using Spearman's correlation. Multiple linear regression analysis was employed in order to identify the relative importance of imaging metrics in modeling different clinical variables. Regional fiber composition of the CC differentially explained the response variables (Expanded Disability Status Scale [EDSS], cognitive impairment). Increases in EDSS were explained by reductions in CC thickness and MD. Cognitive impairment was mainly explained by FA reductions in the genu and splenium. Regional CC imaging properties differentially explained disability within RRMS patients revealing strong, distinct patterns of correlation with clinical and cognitive status of patients affected by this specific clinical phenotype. © 2014 The Authors.

Forty-four MS patients and 30 healthy subjects underwent optical coherence tomography. DTI was analysed with a voxel-based whole brain and region-based analysis of optic radiation, corpus callosum and further white matter. Correlations between RNFL, fractional anisotropy (FA) and other DTI-based parameters were assessed in patients and controls. RNFL correlated with optic radiation FA, but also with corpus callosum and remaining white matter FA.

762,2-s2.0-84919587900,Restoration of axon conduction and motor deficits by therapeutic treatment with glatiramer acetate,"<p>Glatiramer acetate (GA; Copaxone) is an approved drug for the treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS). The underlying multifactorial anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective effect of GA is in the induction of reactive T cells that release immunomodulatory cytokines and neurotrophic factors at the injury site. These GA-induced cytokines and growth factors may have a direct effect on axon function. Building on previous findings that suggest a neuroprotective effect of GA, we assessed the therapeutic effects of GA on brain and spinal cord pathology and functional correlates using the chronic experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mouse model of MS. Therapeutic regimens were utilized based on promising prophylactic efficacy. More specifically, C57BL/6 mice were treated with 2 mg/mouse/day GA for 8 days beginning at various time points after EAE post-induction day 15, yielding a thorough, clinically relevant assessment of GA efficacy within the context of severe progressive disease. Therapeutic treatment with GA significantly decreased clinical scores and improved rotorod motor performance in EAE mice. These functional improvements were supported by an increase in myelinated axons and fewer amyloid precursor protein-positive axons in the spinal cords of GA-treated EAE mice. Furthermore, therapeutic GA decreased microglia/macrophage and T cell infiltrates and increased oligodendrocyte numbers in both the spinal cord and corpus callosum of EAE mice. Finally, GA improved callosal axon conduction and nodal protein organization in EAE. Our results demonstrate that therapeutic GA treatment has significant beneficial effects in a chronic mouse model of MS, in which its positive effects on both myelinated and non-myelinated axons results in improved axon function. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p>"

The approach decomposes the observed variability of repeatedly measured high-dimensional observations into three additive components: a subject-specific imaging random intercept that quantifies the cross-sectional variability, a subject-specific imaging slope that quantifies the dynamic irreversible deformation over multiple realizations, and a subject-visit-specific imaging deviation that quantifies exchangeable effects between visits. The proposed method is very fast, scalable to studies including ultrahigh-dimensional data, and can easily be adapted to and executed on modest computing infrastructures. The method is applied to the longitudinal analysis of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data of the corpus callosum of multiple sclerosis (MS) subjects. The study includes 176 subjects observed at 466 visits. For each subject and visit the study contains a registered DTI scan of the corpus callosum at roughly 30,000 voxels. © Institute of Mathematical Statistics, 2014.</p>"

766,2-s2.0-84907275709,"Establishment and characterization of an optimized mouse model of multiple sclerosis-induced neuropathic pain using behavioral, pharmacologic, histologic and immunohistochemical methods","<p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS) that causes debilitating central neuropathic pain in many patients. Although mouse models of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) have provided insight on the pathobiology of MS-induced neuropathic pain, concurrent severe motor impairments confound quantitative assessment of pain behaviors over the disease course. To address this issue, we have established and characterized an optimized EAE-mouse model of MS-induced neuropathic pain. Briefly, C57BL/6 mice were immunized with MOG<sub>35-55</sub>(200 μg) and adjuvants comprising Quil A (45 μg) and pertussis toxin (2 × 250 ng). The traditionally used Freund's Complete Adjuvant (FCA) was replaced with Quil A, as FCA itself induces CNS neuroinflammation. Herein, EAE-mice exhibited a mild relapsing-remitting clinical disease course with temporal development of mechanical allodynia in the bilateral hindpaws. Mechanical allodynia was fully developed by 28-30 days post-immunization (p.i.) and was maintained until study completion (52-60 days p.i.), in the absence of confounding motor deficits. Single bolus doses of amitriptyline (1-7 mg/kg), gabapentin (10-50 mg/kg) and morphine (0.1-2 mg/kg) evoked dose-dependent analgesia in the bilateral hindpaws of EAE-mice; the corresponding ED<sub>50</sub>s were 1.5, 20 and 1 mg/kg respectively. At day 39 p.i. in EAE-mice exhibiting mechanical allodynia in the hindpaws, there was marked demyelination and gliosis in the brain and lumbar spinal cord, mirroring these pathobiologic hallmark features of MS in humans. Our optimized EAE-mouse model of MS-associated neuropathic pain will be invaluable for future investigation of the pathobiology of MS-induced neuropathic pain and for efficacy profiling of novel molecules as potential new analgesics for improved relief of this condition. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.</p>"

To investigate the effects of PGF<sub>2α</sub>/FP receptor signaling on demyelination, we administrated FP receptor agonist and antagonist to cuprizone-exposed mice, a model of multiple sclerosis. Mice were fed a diet containing 0.2% cuprizone for 5 weeks, which induces severe demyelination, glial activation, proinflammatory cytokine expression, and motor dysfunction. Administration of the FP receptor antagonist AL-8810 attenuated cuprizone-induced demyelination, glial activation, and TNFα expression in the corpus callosum, and also improved the motor function. These data suggest that during cuprizone-induced demyelination, PGF<sub>2α</sub>/FP receptor signaling contributes to glial activation, neuroinflammation, and demyelination, resulting in motor dysfunction. Thus, FP receptor inhibition may be a useful symptomatic treatment in multiple sclerosis. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.</p>"

In addition to the part played by the lymphocytes, the underlying mechanisms could, in part, be also attributed to activation mediated by astrocytes. Macrophage inflammatory protein-1α (MIP-1α) has been implicated in a number of pathological conditions, specifically attributable to its potent chemottractant effects. Its modulation by IL-17, however, has received very little attention. In the present study, we demonstrated IL-17-mediated induction of MIP-1α in rat primary astroctyes through its binding to the cognate IL-17RA. Furthermore, this effect was mediated via the activation of Src, mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), PI3K/Akt and NF-kB pathways, culminating ultimately into increased expression of MIP-1α. Exposure of primary mouse astrocytes to IL-17 resulted in increased expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein and, this effect was abrogated in cells cultured in presence of the MIP-1α neutralizing antibody, thus underscoring its role in the activation of astrocytes. In vivo relevance of these findings was further corroborated in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis mice that demonstrated significantly increased activation of astrocytes with concomitant increased expression of MIP-1α in the corpus callosum compared with control group. Understanding the regulation of MIP-1α expression may provide insights into the development of potential therapeutic targets for neuroinflammation associated with multiple sclerosis. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.</p>"
773,2-s2.0-84921057340,"Rapid, high-resolution, whole-brain, susceptibility-based MRI of multiple sclerosis","<p>Background: Susceptibility-based MRI offers a unique opportunity to study neurological diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS). In this work, we assessed a three-dimensional segmented echo-planar-imaging (3D-EPI) sequence to rapidly acquire high-resolution T2-weighted and phase contrast images of the whole brain. We also assessed if these images could depict important features of MS at clinical field strength, and we tested the effect of a gadolinium-based contrast agent (GBCA) on these images. Materials and methods: The 3D-EPI acquisition was performed on four healthy volunteers and 15 MS cases on a 3T scanner. The 3D sagittal images of the whole brain were acquired with a voxel size of 0.55 × 0.55 × 0.55 mm3 in less than 4 minutes. For the MS cases, the 3D-EPI acquisition was performed before, during, and after intravenous GBCA injection. Results: Both T2-weighted and phase-contrast images from the 3D-EPI acquisition were sensitive to the presence of lesions, parenchymal veins, and tissue iron. Conspicuity of the veins was enhanced when images were obtained during injection of GBCA. Conclusions: We propose this rapid imaging sequence for investigating, in a clinical setting, the spatiotemporal relationship between small parenchymal veins, iron deposition, and lesions in MS patient brains. © The Author(s) 2014.</p>"

Positron-emission tomography (PET) imaging, using specific tracers, may be an adequate technique to monitor these events in vivo and therefore may become a tool for monitoring disease progression in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. Objectives: The objective of this paper is to evaluate the potential of PET imaging in monitoring local lesions, using [11C] MeDAS, [11C]PK11195 and [18F]FDG as PET tracers for myelin density, microglia activation and glucose metabolism, respectively. Methods: Sprague-Dawley rats were stereotactically injected with either 1% lysolecithin or saline in the corpus callosum and striatum of the right brain hemisphere. PET imaging was performed three days, one week and four weeks after injection. Animals were terminated after PET imaging and the brains were explanted for (immuno)histochemical analysis. Results: PET imaging was able to detect local demyelination induced by lysolecithin in the corpus callosum and striatum with [11C]MeDAS and concomitant microglia activation and monocyte recruitment with [11C]PK11195. [18F]FDG imaging demonstrated that glucose metabolism was maintained in the demyelinated lesions. Conclusion: PET imaging with multiple tracers allows simultaneous in vivo monitoring of myelin density, neuroinflammation and brain metabolism in small MS-like lesions, indicating its potential to monitor disease progression in MS patients. © The Author(s) 2014.</p>"

Methods: Brain dual-echo, 3D T1-weighted and DT MRI scans were acquired from 147 MS patients and 90 gender- and age-matched healthy controls (HCs). Patients were stratified by the presence of depression (92 depressed (D), 55 not depressed (nD)) and fatigue (81 fatigued (F), 66 not fatigued (nF)). Sixty-five patients had co-occurrence of depression and fatigue (DF). Whole-brain voxel-wise comparisons of WM DT MRI abnormalities were performed using tract-based-spatial-statistics (TBSS). Tract-specific analyses were run in brain WM tracts using standard-space templates. Results: Whole-brain voxel-wise analysis yielded no significant differences between patient subgroups. At tract-specific analysis, DF patients had reduced fractional anisotropy (FA) of the forceps minor. Reduced FA of the right anterior thalamic radiation and right uncinate fasciculus was found in F-MS vs not F-MS patients after correcting for depression. No significant differences were found between D vs not D-MS patients, after correcting for fatigue. Conclusions: This study provides evidence for partially overlapping damage to frontal and fronto-temporal pathways underlying depression and fatigue in MS. © The Author(s) 2014.</p>"

Concomitant brain developmental abnormalities have been described. Our aim was to investigate Kallmann syndrome-related brain changes with conventional and novel quantitative MR imaging analyses. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-five male patients with Kallmann syndrome (mean age, 30.7 years; range, 9-55 years) and 23 age-matched male controls underwent brain MR imaging. The MR imaging study protocol included 3D-T1, FLAIR, and diffusion tensor imaging (32 noncollinear gradient-encoding directions; b-value = 800 s/mm<sup>2</sup>). Voxel-based morphometry, sulcation, curvature, and cortical thickness analyses and tract-based spatial statistics were performed by using Statistical Parametric Mapping 8, FreeSurfer, and the fMRI of the Brain Software Library. RESULTS: Corpus callosum partial agenesis, multiple sclerosis-like white matter abnormalities, and acoustic schwannoma were found in 1 patient each. The total amount of gray and white matter volume and tract-based spatial statistics measures (fractional anisotropy and mean, radial, and axial diffusivity) did not differ between patients with Kallmann syndrome and controls. By specific analyses, patients with Kallmann syndrome presented with symmetric clusters of gray matter volume increase and decrease and white matter volume decrease close to the olfactory sulci; reduced sulcal depth of the olfactory sulci and deeper medial orbitalfrontal sulci; lesser curvature of the olfactory sulcus and sharper curvature close to the medial orbital-frontal sulcus; and increased cortical thickness within the olfactory sulcus. CONCLUSIONS: This large MR imaging study on male patients with Kallmann syndrome featured significant morphologic and structural brain changes, likely driven by olfactory bulb hypo-/aplasia, selectively involving the basal forebrain cortex.</p>"
781,2-s2.0-84905010647,Cognitive dysfunction in pediatric multiple sclerosis,"<p>Cognitive and neuropsychological impairments are well documented in adult multiple sclerosis (MS). Research has only recently focused on cognitive disabilities in pediatric cases, highlighting some differences between pediatric and adult cases. Impairments in several functions have been reported in children, particularly in relation to attention, processing speed, visual-motor skills, and language. Language seems to be particularly vulnerable in pediatric MS, unlike in adults in whom it is usually preserved. Deficits in executive functions, which are considered MS-specific in adults, have been inconsistently reported in children. In children, as compared to adults, the relationship between cognitive dysfunctions and the two other main symptoms of MS, fatigue and psychiatric disorders, was poorly explored. Furthermore, data on the correlations of cognitive impairments with clinical and neuroimaging features are scarce in children, and the results are often incongruent; interestingly, involvement of corpus callosum and reduced thalamic volume differentiated patients identified as having a cognitive impairment from those without a cognitive impairment. Further studies about pediatric MS are needed in order to better understand the impact of the disease on brain development and the resulting effect on cognitive functions, particularly with respect to different therapeutic strategies. © 2014 Suppiej and Cainelli.</p>"
782,2-s2.0-84940094081,A new model of Cuprizone-Mediated demyelination/remyelination,"<p>In the central nervous system, demyelinating diseases, such as multiple sclerosis, result in devastating long-term neurologic damage, in part because of the lack of effective remyelination in the adult human brain. One model used to understand the mechanisms regulating remyelination is cuprizone-induced demyelination, which allows investigation of remyelination mechanisms in adult animals following toxin-induced demyelination. Unfortunately, the degree of demyelination in the cuprizone model can vary, which complicates understanding the process of remyelination. Previous work in our laboratory demonstrated that the Akt/mTOR pathway regulates active myelination. When given to young postnatal mice, the mTOR inhibitor, rapamycin, inhibits active myelination. In the current study, the cuprizone model was modified by the addition of rapamycin during cuprizone exposure. When administered together, cuprizone and rapamycin produced more complete demyelination and provided a longer time frame over which to investigate remyelination than treatment with cuprizone alone. The consistency in demyelination will allow a better understanding of the mechanisms initiating remyelination. Furthermore, the slower rate of remyelination provides a longer window of time in which to investigate the diverse contributing factors that regulate remyelination. This new model of cuprizone-induced demyelination could potentially aid in identification of new therapeutic targets to enhance remyelination in demyelinating diseases. © The Author(s) 2014.</p>"

Diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases is increasingly based on biomarkers. Although lumbar puncture is routinely performed during the diagnostic workup of HDLS, reports on alterations of neurodegeneration-specific biochemical markers have not been documented so far. We report a 35-year-old woman with clinical, radiological and neuropathological signs of HDLS. She suffered from a rapidly progressive frontal lobe syndrome. Brain MRI revealed diffuse leucoencephalopathy with predominant involvement of the periventricular white matter and corpus callosum. Although she was severely impaired and leucoencephalopathy was prominent, only cerebrospinal fluid total-τ was moderately elevated. Other markers of neuronal (NSE) and astrocytic (S100B) damage were within normal range. Therefore, biochemical markers of central nervous system damage are not helpful in the diagnosis of HDLS.

Patients may have motor and sensory involvement, but generally motor involvement may be more prominent and more severe in lower extremities. CIDP is a treatable neuropathy that is challenging to diagnose and has a broad spectrum of presentations. When ranked by the descending frequency, postural tremor in the arms, peripheral nerve thickening, papilledema and facial or bulbar weakness, respiratory failure and autonomic dysfunction can be seen in patients with CIDP. Demyelinating neuropathy predominantly affects spinal roots, plexuses and proximal nerve trunks and thickened nerves can be palpable in about 10% of the patients. In patients with atypical presentation, the diagnosis of CIDP may be delayed and hypertrophic nerve roots have been reported in CIDP patients with delayed diagnosis. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) may be helpful in the diagnosis of CIDP by excluding the compressive or structural lesions that may lead to polyradiculopathy and MRI may also show hypertrophy of nerve roots and inflammatory processes in CIDP. We presented a patient with CIDP who had MRI findings of diffuse enlargement and mild enhancement of roots and extraforaminal segments of nerves in all segments. © 2014 OMU.</p>"

However, one of the important parameters affecting diffusion is the water exchange rate between the intra- and extra-axonal space, which has not been fully investigated and is a crucial marker of brain injury such as multiple sclerosis (MS), stroke, and traumatic brain injury (TBI). To our knowledge, there is no diffusion analytical model which includes the Water eXchange Rate (WXR) without the requirement of short gradient pulse (SGP) approximation. We therefore propose a new analytical model by deriving the diffusion signal for a permeable cylinder, assuming a clinically feasible pulse gradient spin echo (PGSE) sequence. Simulations based on Markov Random Walk confirm that the exchange parameter included in our model has a linear correlation (R<sup>2</sup>&gt;0.88) with the actual WXR. Moreover, increasing WXR causes the estimated values of diameter and volume fraction of the cylinders to increase and decrease, respectively, which is consistent with our findings from histology measurements in tissues near TBI regions. This model was also applied to the diffusion signal acquired from ex vivo brains of 14 male (10 TBI and 4 normal) rats using hybrid diffusion imaging. The estimated values of axon diameter and axonal volume fraction are in agreement with their corresponding histological measurements in normal brains, with 0.96 intra-class correlation coefficient value resulting from consistency analysis. Moreover, a significant increase (p = 0.001) in WXR and diameter and decrease in axonal volume fraction in the TBI boundary were detected in the TBI rats compared with the normal rats. © 2014 Davoodi-Bojd et al.</p>"

Other reported adverse events have included melanoma, primary central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma, and gastrointestinal cryptosporidiosis. An MS exacerbation may occur after discontinuation and immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS), particularly in the setting of PML, is also possible. We present the first case of cryptococcal meningitis in a patient taking natalizumab. Managements of both cryptococcal meningitis and MS after discontinuation of natalizumab are the focus of this report. Observations This is a case report describing a 49-year old Caucasian man with relapsing-remitting MS (RR-MS) on natalizumab. On the twenty-fourth month of natalizumab treatment, he developed cryptococcal meningitis, prompting its discontinuation. Two months later, off natalizumab, while on antifungal treatment, he developed an MS exacerbation. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) JC virus polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) serology were repeatedly negative. Conclusions and relevance Although specific recommendations for treating natalizumab-associated cryptococcal meningitis do not exist, our patient discontinued natalizumab and started conventional anti-fungal treatment. Two months later, he was treated with steroids due to worsening neurologic status from a presumed MS attack. Subsequently, he improved with successful treatment of the cryptococcal meningitis, with no new clinical or radiographic exacerbations. © 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.</p>"

To explore early signs of altered connectivity in MS from a structural and functional perspective, the morphology of corpus callosum (CC) was correlated with a dynamic inter-hemispheric connectivity index.Twenty mildly disabled patients affected by a relapsing-remitting (RR) form of MS (EDSS. ≤. 3.5) and 15 healthy subjects underwent structural MRI to measure CC thickness over 100 sections and electroencephalography to assess a spectral coherence index between primary regions devoted to hand control, at rest and during an isometric handgrip.In patients, an overall CC atrophy was associated with increased lesion load. A less efficacious inter-hemispheric coherence (IHCoh) during movement was associated with CC atrophy in sections interconnecting homologous primary motor areas (anterior mid-body). In healthy controls, less efficacious IHCoh at rest was associated with a thinner CC splenium.Our data suggest that in mildly disabled RR-MS patients a covert impairment may be detected in the correlation between the structural (CC thickness) and functional (IHCoh) measures of homologous networks, whereas these two counterparts do not yet differ individually from controls. © 2014 IBRO.</p>"

The regional distribution of white matter (WM) and gray matter (GM) damage was assessed using voxel-wise analyses. Default mode network (DMN) RS functional connectivity (FC) was also measured. Results: Sixteen patients (45%) were classified as cognitively impaired. Compared to cognitively preserved (CP) patients, cognitively impaired patients with MS had higher occurrence of T2 lesions as well as more severe damage to the WM and GM, as measured by atrophy and diffusivity abnormalities, in the posterior regions of the parietal lobes close to the midline (precuneus, posterior cingulum, and corpus callosum). Compared to the other study groups, they also showed reduced RS FC of the precuneus, whereas CP patients experienced an increased RS FC of the anterior cingulate cortex. A multivariable model identified diffusivity abnormalities of the cingulum and corpus callosum and RS FC of the precuneus as the covariates more strongly associated with cognitive impairment (C-index = 0.99). Conclusions: In pediatric patients with MS, cognitive dysfunction is associated with structural and functional abnormalities of the posterior core regions of the DMN. WM structural abnormalities co-occurring at this level are likely to be the substrate of such modifications. © 2014 American Academy of Neurology.</p>"

790,2-s2.0-84893544622,Upper limb motor rehabilitation impacts white matter microstructure in multiple sclerosis,"<p>Upper limb impairments can occur in patients with multiple sclerosis, affecting daily living activities; however there is at present no definite agreement on the best rehabilitation treatment strategy to pursue. Moreover, motor training has been shown to induce changes in white matter architecture in healthy subjects.This study aimed at evaluating the motor behavioral and white matter microstructural changes following a 2-month upper limb motor rehabilitation treatment based on task-oriented exercises in patients with multiple sclerosis.Thirty patients (18 females and 12 males; age. = 43.3. ±. 8.7. years) in a stable phase of the disease presenting with mild or moderate upper limb sensorimotor deficits were randomized into two groups of 15 patients each. Both groups underwent twenty 1-hour treatment sessions, three times a week. The ""treatment group"" received an active motor rehabilitation treatment, based on voluntary exercises including task-oriented exercises, while the ""control group"" underwent passive mobilization of the shoulder, elbow, wrist and fingers.Before and after the rehabilitation protocols, motor performance was evaluated in all patients with standard tests. Additionally, finger motor performance accuracy was assessed by an engineered glove.In the same sessions, every patient underwent diffusion tensor imaging to obtain parametric maps of fractional anisotropy, mean diffusivity, axial diffusivity, and radial diffusivity. The mean value of each parameter was separately calculated within regions of interest including the fiber bundles connecting brain areas involved in voluntary movement control: the corpus callosum, the corticospinal tracts and the superior longitudinal fasciculi.The two rehabilitation protocols induced similar effects on unimanual motor performance, but the bimanual coordination task revealed that the residual coordination abilities were maintained in the treated patients while they significantly worsened in the control group (p. = 0.002). Further, in the treatment group white matter integrity in the corpus callosum and corticospinal tracts was preserved while a microstructural integrity worsening was found in the control group (fractional anisotropy of the corpus callosum and corticospinal tracts: p. = 0.033 and p. = 0.022; radial diffusivity of the corpus callosum and corticospinal tracts: p. = 0.004 and p. = 0.008). Conversely, a significant increase of radial diffusivity was observed in the superior longitudinal fasciculi in both groups (p. = 0.02), indicating lack of treatment effects on this structure, showing damage progression likely due to a demyelination process.All these findings indicate the importance of administering, when possible, a rehabilitation treatment consisting of voluntary movements. We also demonstrated that the beneficial effects of a rehabilitation treatment are task-dependent and selective in their target; this becomes crucial towards the implementation of tailored rehabilitative approaches. © 2013 The Authors.</p>"

Management of multiple sclerosis during pregnancy is a difficult issue because of pregnancy-related complications and fear of congenital anomalies due to exposure to diseasemodifying therapy. In different series, INF therapy was withdrawn before or after variable periods of exposure. This case illustrates a 26-year-old woman diagnosed with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis who was treated with a weekly regimen of intramuscular INF-β 1a (Avonex). She had received this treatment throughout her pregnancy without any further exacerbations of symptoms or any untoward pregnancy-related complications. In contrast to different series, our patient had the longest exposure to INF-β during pregnancy. Copyright 2014 BMJ Publishing Group. All rights reserved.</p>"

The response given the functional predictor is assumed to come from the distribution of an exponential family. A penalized likelihood approach is proposed to estimate the unknown intercept and coefficient function in the model. Inference tools such as point-wise confidence intervals of the coefficient function and prediction intervals are derived. The minimax rate of convergence for the error in predicting the mean response is established. It is shown that the penalized likelihood estimator attains the optimal rate of convergence. Our simulations demonstrate a competitive performance against the existing approach. The method is further illustrated in the use of the DTI tractography to distinguish corpus callosum tracts with multiple sclerosis from normal tracts.</p>
793,2-s2.0-84893816749,Accelerated repair of demyelinated CNS lesions in the absence of non-muscle myosin IIB,"<p>The oligodendrocyte (OL), the myelinating cell of the central nervous system, undergoes dramatic changes in the organization of its cytoskeleton as it differentiates from a precursor (oligodendrocyte precursor cells) to a myelin-forming cell. These changes include an increase in its branching cell processes, a phenomenon necessary for OL to myelinate multiple axon segments. We have previously shown that levels and activity of non-muscle myosin II (NMII), a regulator of cytoskeletal contractility, decrease as a function of differentiation and that inhibition of NMII increases branching and myelination of OL in coculture with neurons. We have also found that mixed glial cell cultures derived from NMIIB knockout mice display an increase in mature myelin basic protein-expressing OL compared with wild-type cultures. We have now extended our studies to investigate the role of NMIIB ablation on myelin repair following focal demyelination by lysolecithin. To this end, we generated an oligodendrocyte-specific inducible knockout model using a Plp-driven promoter in combination with a temporally activated CRE-ER fusion protein. Our data indicate that conditional ablation of NMII in adult mouse brain, expedites lesion resolution and remyelination by Plp+ oligodendrocyte-lineage cells when compared with that observed in control brains. Taken together, these data validate the function of NMII as that of a negative regulator of OL myelination in vivo and provide a novel target for promoting myelin repair in conditions such as multiple sclerosis. © 2014 The Authors Glia Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p>"

Onset of multiple sclerosis is extremely uncommon in early childhood, particularly before 6years of age. We report the case of a 5-year-old girl admitted to the hospital for altered consciousness and rapid onset of right hemiparaplegia. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain showed multifocal white matter disease with T2 hyperintense oval lesions in subcortical, periventricular, and cerebellar hemispheres. Treatment with high dose intravenous methylprednisolone (30. mg/kg/day for 3days) improved symptoms. Intravenous corticosteroid therapy was followed by 1. mg/kg/day of oral prednisone. A second MRI, 40days later, revealed new disseminated T2 hyperintense lesions in the frontal periventricular white matter, corpus callosum, left middle cerebellar peduncle, and dorsal spinal cord, leading to the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis. Azathioprine (2.5. mg/kg/day) was started and the steroid dose was tapered before being stopped after 3months. After 2years of follow-up, the patient has remained asymptomatic with a normal neurological exam and with no relapse or side effects of azathioprine.

Methods: Forty CIS patients were administered tests of verbal short-term/working memory and passage learning. Using dynamic susceptibility contrast MRI cerebral blood volume (CBV), cerebral blood flow and mean transit time values were estimated in 20 cerebral regions of interest, placed in normal appearing white matter (NAWM) and normal appearing deep gray matter structures, bilaterally. Results: CIS patients showed significantly impaired scores on working memory and secondary verbal memory that correlated inversely with elevated CBV values in the left frontal and periventricular NAWM, thalamus, right caudate and corpus callosum. Conclusions: Verbal memory in CIS correlates inversely with elevated CBV values of brain structures involved in memory. As these hemodynamic changes, detected in CIS, are indicative of inflammation, the observed cognitive disturbances may relate to widespread brain inflammatory processes that prevail in early multiple sclerosis. © 2013 The Author(s).

796,2-s2.0-84893392360,CLIPPERS: Chronic lymphocytic inflammation with pontine perivascular enhancement responsive to steroids. Review of an increasingly recognized entity within the spectrum of inflammatory central nervous system disorders,"<p>Summary: Chronic lymphocytic inflammation with pontine perivascular enhancement responsive to steroids (CLIPPERS) is a recently defined inflammatory central nervous system (CNS) disorder, prominently involving the brainstem and in particular the pons. The condition features a combination of clinical symptoms essentially referable to brainstem pathology and a characteristic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) appearance with punctate and curvilinear gadolinium enhancement 'peppering' the pons. The radiological distribution is focused in the pons and adjacent rhombencephalic structures such as the cerebellar peduncles, cerebellum, medulla and the midbrain. While the lesion burden with a perivascular pattern is typically most dense in these pontine and peripontine regions, enhancing lesions may additionally extend into the spinal cord and supratentorial structures such as the thalamus, basal ganglia, capsula interna, corpus callosum and the cerebral white matter. Another core feature is clinical and radiological responsiveness to glucocorticosteroid (GCS)-based immunosuppression. As withdrawal of GCS treatment results commonly in disease exacerbation, long-term immunosuppressive therapy appears to be mandatory for sustained improvement. Diagnosis of CLIPPERS is challenging, and requires careful exclusion of alternative diagnoses. A specific serum or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarker for the disorder is currently not known. Pathogenesis of CLIPPERS remains poorly understood, and the nosological position of CLIPPERS has still to be established. Whether CLIPPERS represents an independent, actual new disorder or a syndrome that includes aetiologically heterogeneous diseases and/or their prestages remains a debated and not finally clarified issue. Clinicians and radiologists should be aware of this condition and its differential diagnoses, given that CLIPPERS constitutes a treatable condition and that patients may benefit from an early introduction of GCS ensued by long-term immunosuppression. Based on previous reports in literature-currently encompassing more than 50 reported cases of CLIPPERS-this review addresses clinical features, diagnostic criteria, differential diagnoses and therapeutic management of this peculiar disorder. © 2013 British Society for Immunology.</p>"

PET imaging using specific myelin radioligands might solve the lack of a specific imaging tool for diagnosing and monitoring demyelination and remyelination in MS patients. In recent years, a few tracers have been developed for in vivo PET imaging of myelin, but they have not been fully evaluated yet. In this study, we compared [<sup>11</sup>C]CIC and [<sup>11</sup>C]MeDAS as PET tracers for monitoring demyelination and remyelination in cuprizone-fed mice. The ex vivo biodistribution of [<sup>11</sup>C]CIC showed decreased tracer uptake in mice fed with 0.2% cuprizone diet for 5weeks, as compared to control mice. However, tracer uptake did not increase again after normal diet was restored for 5weeks (remyelination). Surprisingly, in vivo PET imaging with [<sup>11</sup>C]CIC in cuprizone-fed mice revealed a significant reduction in whole brain tracer uptake after 5weeks of remyelination. No correlation between ex vivo biodistribution and in vivo imaging data was found for [<sup>11</sup>C]CIC (r<sup>2</sup>=0.15, p=0.11). However, a strong correlation was found for [<sup>11</sup>C]MeDAS (r<sup>2</sup>=0.88, p&lt;0.0001). [<sup>11</sup>C]MeDAS ex vivo biodistribution revealed significant decreased brain uptake in the demyelination group, as compared to controls and increased the tracer uptake after 5weeks of remyelination. [<sup>11</sup>C]MeDAS images showed a low background signal and clear uptake in the brain white matter and spinal cord. Taken together, the results of this comparative study between [<sup>11</sup>C]CIC and [<sup>11</sup>C]MeDAS clearly show that [<sup>11</sup>C]MeDAS is the preferred PET tracer to monitor myelin changes in the brain and spinal cord in vivo. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.</p>"
798,2-s2.0-84894670806,Interhemispheric cooperation in global-local visual processing in pediatric multiple sclerosis,"<p>Impairments in visuospatial abilities are commonly reported in children and adolescents with multiple sclerosis (MS). Corpus callosum (CC) pathology occurs in patients with MS and may contribute to impairment in visuospatial perception, particularly when interhemispheric information transfer is required. This study used a global-local hierarchical letter paradigm to examine the relationship between interhemispheric information transfer and white matter integrity in the CC assessed using diffusion tensor imaging. Thirteen cognitively preserved pediatric-onset MS patients and 15 age-matched healthy controls were asked to determine whether a target letter E appeared at the attended level of the stimulus. As expected, both groups processed global and local information more slowly under divided than selective attention conditions. The MS group performed similarly to the control group with respect to reaction time and accuracy on selective and divided attention conditions, with one exception. Specifically, the presence of a global target when attending to a local target caused greater response conflict in the MS group than in controls (p =.01). Pooling both the patient and control data, greater response conflict was associated with reduced white matter integrity as indicated by lower fractional anisotropy in the anterior body of the CC (r = -.33, p &lt;.05). Results suggest that reduced white matter integrity in anterior regions of the CC may lead to less efficient inhibition of task-irrelevant global information in the hierarchal processing of visual information. © 2014 © 2014 Taylor &amp; Francis.</p>"

We aimed to assess sodium accumulation in progressive MS, known to suffer from severe neuronal injury. Materials and methods: 3D- <sup>23</sup>Na-MRI was obtained on a 3T-MR-scanner in 20 progressive MS patients [11 primary-progressive (PPMS) and nine secondary-progressive (SPMS)] and 15 controls. Total sodium concentrations (TSC) within grey matter (GM), normal-appearing white matter (WM) and lesions were extracted. Statistical mapping analyses of TSC abnormalities were also performed. Results: Progressive MS patients presented higher GM-TSC values (48.8 ± 3.1 mmol/l wet tissue vol, p &lt; 0.001) and T<sub>2</sub>lesions-TSC values (50.9 ± 2.2 mmol/l wet tissue vol, p = 0.01) compared to GM and WM of controls. Statistical mapping analysis showed TSC increases in PPMS patients confined to motor and somatosensory cortices, prefrontal cortices, pons and cerebellum. In SPMS, TSC increases were associated with areas involving: primary motor, premotor and somatosensory cortices; prefrontal, cingulate and visual cortices; the corpus callosum, thalami, brainstem and cerebellum. Anterior prefrontal and premotor cortices TSC were correlated with disability. Conclusion: Sodium accumulation is present in progressive MS patients, more restricted to the motor system in PPMS and more widespread in SPMS. Local brain sodium accumulation appears as a promising marker to monitor patients with progressive MS. © 2013 ESMRMB.</p>"
800,2-s2.0-84892476169,"A novel approach with ""skeletonised MTR"" measures tract-specific microstructural changes in early primary-progressive MS","<p>We combined tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) and magnetization transfer (MT) imaging to assess white matter (WM) tract-specific short-term changes in early primary-progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS) and their relationships with clinical progression. Twenty-one PPMS patients within 5 years from onset underwent MT and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) at baseline and after 12 months. Patients' disability was assessed. DTI data were processed to compute fractional anisotropy (FA) and to generate a common WM ""skeleton,"" which represents the tracts that are ""common"" to all subjects using TBSS. The MT ratio (MTR) was computed from MT data and co-registered with the DTI. The skeletonization procedure derived for FA was applied to each subject's MTR image to obtain a ""skeletonised"" MTR map for every subject. Permutation tests were used to assess (i) changes in FA, principal diffusivities, and MTR over the follow-up, and (ii) associations between changes in imaging parameters and changes in disability. Patients showed significant decreases in MTR over one year in the corpus callosum (CC), bilateral corticospinal tract (CST), thalamic radiations, and superior and inferior longitudinal fasciculi. These changes were located both within lesions and the normal-appearing WM. No significant longitudinal change in skeletonised FA was found, but radial diffusivity (RD) significantly increased in several regions, including the CST bilaterally and the right inferior longitudinal fasciculus. MTR decreases, RD increases, and axial diffusivity decreases in the CC and CST correlated with a deterioration in the upper limb function. We detected tract-specific multimodal imaging changes that reflect the accrual of microstructural damage and possibly contribute to clinical impairment in PPMS. We propose a novel methodology that can be extended to other diseases to map cross-subject and tract-specific changes in MTR. Hum Brain Mapp 35:723-733, 2014. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p>"

Although the cuprizone mouse model allowed elucidation of many molecular factors governing remyelination, currently very little is known about the spatial origin of the oligodendrocyte progenitor cells that initiate remyelination in this model. Therefore, we here investigated in this model whether subventricular zone (SVZ) neural stem/progenitor cells (NSPCs) contribute to remyelination of the splenium following cuprizone-induced demyelination. Experimentally, from the day of in situ NSPC labeling, C57BL/6J mice were fed a 0.2% cuprizone diet during a 4-week period and then left to recover on a normal diet for 8. weeks. Two in situ labeling strategies were employed: (i) NSPCs were labeled by intraventricular injection of micron-sized iron oxide particles and then followed up longitudinally by means of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and (ii) SVZ NSPCs were transduced with a lentiviral vector encoding the eGFP and Luciferase reporter proteins for longitudinal monitoring by means of in vivo bioluminescence imaging (BLI). In contrast to preceding suggestions, no migration of SVZ NSPC towards the demyelinated splenium was observed using both MRI and BLI, and further validated by histological analysis, thereby demonstrating that SVZ NSPCs are unable to contribute directly to remyelination of the splenium in the cuprizone model. Interestingly, using longitudinal BLI analysis and confirmed by histological analysis, an increased migration of SVZ NSPC-derived neuroblasts towards the olfactory bulb was observed following cuprizone treatment, indicative for a potential link between CNS inflammation and increased neurogenesis. © 2013 The Authors.</p>"
803,2-s2.0-84923339100,Lifespan maturation and degeneration of human brain white matter,"<p>Properties of human brain tissue change across the lifespan. Here we model these changes in the living human brain by combining quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measurements of R1 (1/T1) with diffusion MRI and tractography (N=102, ages 7-85). The amount of R1 change during development differs between white-matter fascicles, but in each fascicle the rate of development and decline are mirror-symmetric; the rate of R1 development as the brain approaches maturity predicts the rate of R1 degeneration in aging. Quantitative measurements of macromolecule tissue volume (MTV) confirm that R1 is an accurate index of the growth of new brain tissue. In contrast to R1, diffusion development follows an asymmetric time-course with rapid childhood changes but a slow rate of decline in old age. Together, the time-courses of R1 and diffusion changes demonstrate that multiple biological processes drive changes in white-matter tissue properties over the lifespan. © 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

804,2-s2.0-84922550648,Detection of reduced interhemispheric cortical communication during task execution in multiple sclerosis patients using functional near-infrared spectroscopy,"<p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) impairs brain activity through demyelination and loss of axons. Increased brain activity is accompanied by increases in microvascular hemoglobin oxygen saturation (oxygenation) and total hemoglobin, which can be measured using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). Due to the potentially reduced size and integrity of the white matter tracts within the corpus callosum, it may be expected that MS patients have reduced functional communication between the left and right sides of the brain; this could potentially be an indicator of disease progression. To assess interhemispheric communication in MS, we used fNIRS during a unilateral motor task and the resting state. The magnitude of the change in hemoglobin parameters in the motor cortex was significantly reduced in MS patients during the motor task relative to healthy control subjects. There was also a significant decrease in interhemispheric communication between the motor cortices (expressed as coherence) in MS patients compared to controls during the motor task, but not during the resting state. fNIRS assessment of interhemispheric coherence during task execution may be a useful marker in disorders with white matter damage or axonal loss, including MS. © 2014 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers.</p>"

The underlying pathophysiology is likely an autoimmune mediated occlusion of microvessels resulting in variable degrees of central nervous system (CNS) dysfunction, visual disturbances, and hearing loss. The disease manifests either with a monophasic or polycyclic course. Patients suffering from SuS are frequently misdiagnosed as having inflammatory demyelinating CNS disease, particularly multiple sclerosis because of some overlap in the clinical presentation and the paraclinical findings. Since appropriate treatment of SuS is crucial for the prognosis, a timely and sound establishment of the diagnosis is important. Here, we summarize currently available information on the clinical presentation and diagnostic procedures in SuS. In particular, we discuss the added value of advanced techniques of brain and retinal imaging such as ultrahigh field magnetic resonance imaging and optical coherence tomography in SuS with respect to its differential diagnosis and pathophysiology. Since evidence-based treatment standards will not be available in the near future, we share some experiences in terms of treatment options.

To date, detection of colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF-1R) gene mutation in HDLS gave us hint to think its pathophysiology as a microglial dysfunction, so called ""primary microgliopathy"". Clinical features of HDLS are variable. Typically, psychiatric symptoms and cognitive decline are initial features of HDLS. However, in some cases, when motor symptoms precede cognitive decline, HDLS may mimic primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS). Herein we tried to clarify MRI features of HDLS (2 women, age 22-28 years, average 25.0 years, EDSS 7.00) in comparison with PPMS (6 men and 10 women, age 29-64 years, average 33.7 years, EDSS 6.03). In consequence, our MRI findings suggesting HDLS rather than PPMS are as follows: restricted diffusivity, severe corpus callosum atrophy, and preferential involvement of deep white matter lesion compared with periventricular white matter. In contrast, characteristic features suggesting PPMS are as follows: prevailing periventricular white matter lesion, cerebellar lesions, optic neuritis, and cervical spinal cord lesion. Sagittal fluidattenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images of brain and cervical cord are highly useful to discriminate these two diseases.</p>"

Due to atrophy, the shape of disease affected CC differs distinctively from healthy ones. Therefore, atlases are used that are built from the underlying dataset and do not originate from atlas datasets of healthy brains. The atlas construction is done by clustering the patient images into subgroups of similar images and building a mean image from each cluster. During this work, the optimal number of atlases and the best label fusion method are analyzed. The method is evaluated on 100 T1-weighted brain MRI images from MS patients. Accuracy is assessed by comparing the overlap of the segmentations from the developed method against manual segmentations obtained by a medical student. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.</p>"

Methods We present an example of recurrent neurogenic pulmonary edema in an adolescent boy with multiple sclerosis who was diagnosed with pneumonia at the time of initial presentation. We also review the presenting symptoms, physiologic parameters, and imaging findings from published reports of patients with multiple sclerosis presenting with neurogenic pulmonary edema. Results Although all 11 cases found via literature review presented with respiratory symptoms, cardiac dysfunction was variable, as was the presence of other neurological findings. All but one case had a documented medullary lesion. Corticosteroids were effective in resolving symptoms. Three patients were not treated with corticosteroids, and one of these died (onset of pulmonary edema during sleep).

Timely differentiation of neuromyelitis optica from MS is imperative, determining both prognosis and treatment strategy. Early, aggressive immunosuppression is required to prevent the accrual of severe disability in neuromyelitis optica; conversely, MS-specific therapies may exacerbate the disease. The diagnosis of neuromyelitis optica requires the integration of clinical, MR imaging, and laboratory data, but current criteria are insensitive and exclude patients with limited clinical syndromes. Failure to recognize the expanding spectrum of cerebral MR imaging patterns associated with aquaporin 4 antibody seropositivity adds to diagnostic uncertainty in some patients.

It is predominantly expressed in the neural tissues and causes cellular morphological changes by activating the small GTPase Rac1. We previously reported that Dock3 overexpression protects retinal ganglion cells from excitotoxic cell death. Oligodendrocytes are the myelinating cells of axons in the central nervous system and these cells are damaged in demyelinating disorders including multiple sclerosis (MS) and optic neuritis. In this study, we examined if Dock3 is expressed in oligodendrocytes and if increasing Dock3 signals can suppress demyelination in a cuprizone-induced demyelination model, an animal model of MS. We demonstrate that Dock3 is expressed in oligodendrocytes and Dock3 overexpression protects myelin in the corpus callosum following cuprizone treatment. Furthermore, we show that cuprizone demyelinates optic nerves and the extent of demyelination is ameliorated in mice overexpressing Dock3. Cuprizone treatment impairs visual function, which was demonstrated by multifocal electroretinograms, an established non-invasive method, and Dock3 overexpression prevented this effect. In mice overexpressing Dock3, Erk activation is increased, suggesting this may at least partly explain the observed protective effects.

Besides other pathophysiological mechanisms, mitochondrial injury is crucially involved in the development and progression of this disease. Mitochondria have been identified as targets for the peptide hormone melatonin. In the present study, we sought to evaluate the impact of oxidative stress on mitochondrial density and enzyme transcription during experimentally induced demyelination and the protective influence of melatonin. Adult male mice were fed with cuprizone for 5 weeks which caused severe demyelination of the corpus callosum (CC). Animals were simultaneously treated with melatonin by daily intra-peritoneal injections. Melatonin exposure reversed cuprizone-induced demyelination and axon protection. Transmission electron microscopy demonstrated significantly increased mitochondrial numbers and slightly increased mitochondrial size within CC axons after cuprizone exposure. Melatonin antagonized these effects and, in addition, induced the expression of subunits of the respiratory chain complex over normal control values reflecting a mechanism to compensate cuprizone-mediated down-regulation of these genes. Similarly, melatonin modulated gene expression of mitochondrial fusion and fission proteins. Biochemical analysis showed that oxidative stress induced by cuprizone was regulated by melatonin. The data implicate that melatonin abolishes destructive cuprizone effects in the CC by decreasing oxidative stress, restoring mitochondrial respiratory enzyme activity and fusion and fission processes as well as decreasing intra-axonal mitochondria accumulation. © 2014 Springer-Verlag.</p>"
814,2-s2.0-84905435700,An MRI review of acquired corpus callosum lesions,"<p>Lesions of the corpus callosum (CC) are seen in a multitude of disorders including vascular diseases, metabolic disorders, tumours, demyelinating diseases, trauma and infections. In some diseases, CC involvement is typical and sometimes isolated, while in other diseases CC lesions are seen only occasionally in the presence of other typical extra-callosal abnormalities. In this review, we will mainly discuss the MRI characteristics of acquired lesions involving the CC. Identification of the origin of the CC lesion depends on the exact localisation of the lesion (s) inside the CC, presence of other lesions seen outside the CC, signal changes on different MRI sequences, evolution over time of the radiological abnormalities, history and clinical state of the patient, and other radiological and non-radiological examinations.</p>"
815,2-s2.0-84903887153,Intracranial germinoma with ventricular system dissemination,"<p>Objective: To study the clinical, neuroimaging and histopathological features of intracranial germinoma. Methods: One case of intracranial germinoma with ventricular system dissemination was reported, and related literatures were reviewed. Results: A 34-year-old male complained of progressive dizziness for 30 d and manifested unsteady gait for 45 d. Radiological examinations revealed low signal intensity on T<sub>1</sub>WI and hyperintense on T<sub>2</sub>WI in the corpus callosum, left cerebellum, around the fourth ventricle, aqueduct mesencephalon, the ventral pons and pineal region, with even or uneven enhancement after contrast. The clinical initial diagnosis was ""intracranial multiple focal lesions and high possibility of multiple sclerosis"". After well response to glucocorticoid impact and dehydration, the patient stopped taking drugs but presented relapse and exacerbation. Later, he underwent biopsy on pineal region and was diagnosed as intracranial germinoma. Microscopically, the big germ cells and lymphocytes coexisted. Tumor cells were epithelioid cells with transparent cytoplasm, prominent nuclei and mitotic activity. Lymphocytes were distributed along interstitial substance of vessel and fiber, and individual syncytiotrophoblasts were sprasely distributed. Immunohistochemical staining showed tumor cells were positive for CD117 and OCT3/4, and the syncytiotrophoblasts were positive for β-human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG). The clinical symptoms were completely alleviated after radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Conclusions: Because of the sensitivity for radiotherapy and chemotherapy, intracranial germinoma can be diagnosed and treated early to improve its prognosis. However, it is very easy to disseminate along with ventricular system and form multiple lesions, leading to atypical clinical and imaging manifestations, which is a big challenge for clinical diagnosis.</p>"
816,2-s2.0-84902546058,Connexins-mediated glia networking impacts myelination and remyelination in the central nervous system,"<p>In the central nervous system (CNS), the glial gap junctions are established among astrocytes (ASTs), oligodendrocytes (OLs), and/or between ASTs and OLs due to the expression of membrane proteins called connexins (Cxs). Together, the glial cells form a network of communicating cells that is important for the homeostasis of brain function for its involvement in the intercellular calcium wave propagation, exchange of metabolic substrates, cell proliferation, migration, and differentiation. Alternatively, Cxs are also involved in hemichannel function and thus participate in gliotransmission. In recent years, pathologic changes of oligodendroglia or demyelination found in transgenic mice with different subsets of Cxs or pharmacological insults suggest that glial Cxs may participate in the regulation of the myelination or remyelination processes. However, little is known about the underlying mechanisms. In this review, we will mainly focus on the functions of Cx-mediated gap junction channels, as well as hemichannels, in brain glial cells and discuss the way by which they impact myelination and remyelination. These aspects will be considered at the light of recent genetic and non-genetic studies related to demyelination and remyelination. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media.</p>"

However, pathologic yawning has not been previously described in NMOSD patients. Patients and methods Nine AQP4-IgG seropositive NMOSD patients experienced excessive yawning not related to sleep deprivation or fatigue. Results Patients were female, aged 19-57 years (median, 39 years) at disease onset. Excessive yawning spells were the presenting symptom of the disease in five patients, lasted 2-16 weeks, and usually occurred in association with nausea, vomiting and hiccups. Brain MRI was abnormal in all patients and most frequently showed brainstem and hypothalamic lesions.

818,2-s2.0-84901997414,Intranasal delivery of central nervous system-retargeted human mesenchymal stromal cells prolongs treatment efficacy of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis,"<p>Summary: Treatment with mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) is currently of interest for a number of diseases including multiple sclerosis. MSCs are known to target inflamed tissues, but in a therapeutic setting their systemic administration will lead to few cells reaching the brain. We hypothesized that MSCs may target the brain upon intranasal administration and persist in central nervous system (CNS) tissue if expressing a CNS-targeting receptor. To demonstrate proof of concept, MSCs were genetically engineered to express a myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein-specific receptor. Engineered MSCs retained their immunosuppressive capacity, infiltrated into the brain upon intranasal cell administration, and were able to significantly reduce disease symptoms of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Mice treated with CNS-targeting MSCs were resistant to further EAE induction whereas non-targeted MSCs did not give such persistent effects. Histological analysis revealed increased brain restoration in engineered MSC-treated mice. In conclusion, MSCs can be genetically engineered to target the brain and prolong therapeutic efficacy in an EAE model. © 2014 John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd.</p>"

In our study, fifteen relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) patients and 15 age- and gender-matched normal controls were included. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) was acquired by employing a single-shot echo planar imaging sequence on a 3.0 T MR scanner and fractional anisotropy (FA) was performed with tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) approach. Finally, widespread WM and GM abnormalities were observed in RRMS patients. Moreover, the relationships between the depressive symptoms which can be measured by Hamilton depression rating scale (HAMD) as well as clinical disabilities measured by the expanded disability status scale (EDSS) and FA changes were listed. There was a positive relation between EDSS and the FA changes in the right inferior parietal lobule, while negative relation was located in the left anterior cingulate cortex and hippocampus. Also a positive relation between HAMD and FA changes was found in the right posterior middle cingulate gyrus, the right hippocampus, the left hypothalamus, the right precentral gyrus, and the posterior cingulate which demonstrated a link between the depressive symptoms and clinically relevant brain areas in RRMS patients. © 2014 Yujuan Shen et al.</p>"

Evidence of cortical thinning in childhood MS is scant. Aims This study aimed to assess cortical thickness in paediatric patients during the initial attack of remitting-relapsing MS. Methods We report two cases of remitting-relapsing MS, with initial attacks at 12 and 16 years of age. We analysed brain cortical thickness (CTh) in these patients and compared these data to the CTh of a control group comprised of six 12-year-old females and six 16-year-old males. Results Both cases exhibited a total brain CTh significantly below that of the control group. This difference was also observed when analysing the CTh of all lobes except the left parietal lobe in one of the cases. Conclusions Cortical atrophy is already present at the time of onset of MS. Studies with larger patient populations that have a more homogenous clinical presentation could identify the time of onset of cortical atrophy and use this parameter as a prognostic and/or treatment marker of MS. © 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of European Paediatric Neurology Society.</p>"

823,2-s2.0-84899087141,The usefulness of brain MRI at onset in the differentiation of multiple sclerosis and seropositive neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders,"<p>Background: Although neuromyelitis optica (NMO) is a central nervous system (CNS) autoimmune disease distinct from multiple sclerosis (MS). NMO and NMO spectrum disorder (NMOSD) sometimes show asymptomatic lesions on brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at onset, and even present with symptomatic brain involvement. Objectives: We investigated whether brain MRI at onset can be helpful for the differentiation of MS and NMOSD. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed initial brain MRIs, performed within three months of onset, in patients with MS (n = 51) and anti-aquaporin4-antibody-positive patients with NMOSD (n = 67). Results: NMOSD patients met the Paty (37%) and Barkhof (13%) criteria, and the criteria of the European Magnetic Imaging in MS (MAGNIMS) study group (9%), for MS. Ovoid lesions perpendicular to the lateral ventricle, isolated juxtacortical lesions in U-fibers and isolated ovoid/round cortical lesions were found only in MS patients, whereas longitudinal corticospinal tract lesions, extensive hemispheric lesions, periependymal lesions surrounding the lateral ventricle and cervicomedullary lesions were found only in NMOSD patients. Conclusions: Our study suggests that it is difficult to differentiate MS from NMOSD by the fulfillment of the MRI criteria for MS on brain MRI at onset; however, the characteristic morphology of brain lesions is highly useful for the early differentiation of the two disorders.© The Author(s) 2013.</p>"

Pharmacokinetic modelling was performed to determine the best method to quantify tracer uptake. Methods: Sprague-Dawley rats were stereotactically injected with either 1 % lysolecithin or saline into the corpus callosum and striatum of the right brain hemisphere. Dynamic PET imaging with simultaneous arterial blood sampling was performed 7 days after saline injection (control group), 7 days after lysolecithin injection (demyelination group) and 4 weeks after lysolecithin injection (remyelination group). Results: The kinetics of [<sup>11</sup>C]CIC, [<sup>11</sup>C]MeDAS and [<sup>11</sup>C]PIB was best fitted by Logan graphical analysis, suggesting that tracer binding is reversible. Compartment modelling revealed that all tracers were fitted best with the reversible two-tissue compartment model. Tracer uptake and distribution volume in lesions were in agreement with myelin status. However, the slow kinetics and homogeneous brain uptake of [<sup>11</sup>C]CIC make this tracer less suitable for in vivo PET imaging. [<sup>11</sup>C]PIB showed good uptake in the white matter in the cerebrum, but [<sup>11</sup>C]PIB uptake in the cerebellum was low, despite high myelin density in this region.

The clinical presentationand pathological features were investigated in a large single institution series of gliomatosis cerebri patients. Methods: Thirty-seven consecutive gliomatosis cerebri cases admitted to Xuanwu Hospital between 2005 and 2009 were retrospectively reviewed. Inclusion criteria included the involvement of at least three cerebral lobes, lack of a single discrete mass and pathological confirmation of diffuse glioma. Clinical information included patient' s age, sex, radiological characters. Pathologic features included the hematoxylin and eosin stain (HE) and immunohistological study. Results: Thirty-seven patients (25 men and 12 women) were aged between 9 and 70 years (average 33.2 ± 2.6). Patients presented with seizures (8/37), intracranial hypertension/headache/nausea (12/37), behavioral and cognitive abnormalities (3/37), focal neurologic deficits (10/37) and non-clinical symptom (4/37). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed in the patients and demonstrated a diffuse infiltrative process with hypointensity signal on T<sub>1</sub>-weighted images and hyperintensity signal on both T<sub>2</sub>-weighted images and fluid attenuated inversion recovery images. Some enhancement on MRI was observed in 16 patients. Twenty-one patients had bilateral involvement, and the other had unilateral involvement; The involved regions included corpus callosum (9/37), supratentorial (32/37), both supratentorial and subratentoral (5/37). Conclusions: For clinicians, the cases of gliomatosis cerebri are easily mistaken on MRI for other more common conditions that cause intracranial diffuse lesions, including those due to multiple sclerosis, viral encephalitis, vascular etiologies. We must combine the brain biopsy, clinical manifestations and the imaging closely, to increase the accurate diagnosis of gliomatosis cerebri. Copyright © 2014 by the Chinese Medical Association.</p>"
826,2-s2.0-84898647255,Intermittent alien hand syndrome and callosal apraxia in multiple sclerosis: Implications for interhemispheric communication,"<p>We report a case of a 47-year-old woman with 35-year history ofmultiple sclerosis, who showed alien hand signs, a rare behavioural disorder that involves unilateral goal-directed movements that are contrary to the individual's intention. Alien hand syndrome has been described in multiple sclerosis (MS) only occasionally and is generally suggestive of callosal disconnection. The patient presented also with bilateral limb apraxia and left hand agraphia, raising the possibility of cortical dysfunction or disconnection, in addition to corpus callosum and white matter involvement. Her specific pattern of symptoms supports the role of the corpus callosum in interhemispheric communication for complex as well as fine motor activities and may indicate that it can serve as both an inhibitory and excitatory function depending on task demands.

827,2-s2.0-84897543565,Evaluation of GABAergic transmission modulation as a novel functional target for management of multiple sclerosis: Exploring inhibitory effect of GABA on glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity,"<p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune inflammatory disease of the central nervous system (CNS) where the communication ability of nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord with each other gets impaired. Some current findings suggest the role of glutamate excitotoxicity in the development and progression of MS. An excess release of glutamate leads to the activation of ionotropic and metabotropic receptors, thus resulting in accumulation of toxic cytoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup> and cell death. However, it has been observed that gamma-aminobutyric acid-A (GABA<sub>A</sub>) receptors located in the nerve terminals activate presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent signaling to inhibit depolarization-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and glutamate release from isolated nerve terminals, which suggest a potential implication of GABA <sub>A</sub> receptor in management of MS. With this proof of concept, we tried to explore the potential of selective GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor agonists or positive allosteric modulators (diazepam and phenobarbitone sodium) and GABA<sub>A</sub> level enhancer (sodium valproate) for management of MS by screening them for their activity in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model in rats and cuprizone-induced demyelination model in mice. In this study, sodium valproate was found to show the best activity in the animal models whereas phenobarbitone sodium showed moderate activity.

828,2-s2.0-84897540764,Application of indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescence for endoscopic biopsy of intraventricular tumors,"<p>Background: Many reports have already indicated the benefit of pathological diagnosis of intra- and periventricular tumors with neuroendoscopic biopsy. However, it is also well known that studies can be occasionally inconclusive because of the small and/or inadequate samples for identification of abnormal tissues. The application of indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescence for endoscopical tumor biopsy under the intraventricular surroundings is a new area not previously reported. We attempted visual differentiation of intraventricular lesions from the surrounding structure using ICG fluorescence and considered the most appropriate region for biopsy. Methods: Three cases (13-14 year-old boys) with secondary hydrocephalus caused by intra- and periventricular tumors were operated for endoscopic transventricular biopsy combined with endoscopic third ventriculostomy. Final pathological diagnoses were suprasellar malignant lymphoma and germ cell tumors in two patients, both associated with intraventricular dissemination. Enhanced tumor visualization with 12.5 mg of ICG administration was obtained using the D-light P light equipment and ICG telescope 5.8 mm/19 cm. Results: It was possible to identify the tumor mass margins themselves and detect the differences of intratumoral ICG accumulation. The areas of tumor dissemination were identifiable by neuroendoscopy but unable to be visualized by ICG fluorescence. Conclusions: We were able to obtain an ICG fluorescence imaging inside the cerebral ventricles by new D-light P system comprised of a camera head telescope. ICG fluorescence with neuroendoscopy can provide useful information for choosing the point of biopsy of intra- and periventricular tumors. However, we need to assess if the ICG accumulation site is the most appropriate for biopsy. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.</p>"

To investigate phenotypic perturbations in neurons in this model, we used apoptotic markers and immunohistochemistry with antibodies to NeuN and other surrogate markers known to be expressed by adult pyramidal Layer V somas, including annexin V, encephalopsin, and Emx1. We found no consistent evidence of chronic loss of Layer V neurons but detected both reversible and chronic decreases in the expression of these markers in conjunction with evidence of cortical demyelination and presynaptic loss. These phenotypic perturbations were present in, but not restricted to, the neocortical Layer V. We also investigated inflammatory responses in the cortex and subcortical white matter of the corpus callosum and spinal dorsal funiculus and found that those in the cortex and corpus callosum were delayed compared with those in the spinal cord. Inflammatory infiltrates initially included T cells, neutrophils, and Iba1-positive microglia/macrophages in the corpus callosum, whereas only Iba1-positive cells were present in the cortex. These data indicate that we have identified a new temporal pattern of subtle phenotypic perturbations in neocortical neurons in this chronic multiple sclerosis model. © 2014 by the American Association of Neuropathologists, Inc.</p>"

There was a history of upper respiratory tract infection 10 days before. On neurologic examination, paraparesia and fall a sleep were identified. On magnetic resonance imaging, the symetric signal increases were seen in biparieto-occipital white matter intented to corpus callosum at T2-weighted sequences and cytotoxic edema was seen at diffusion-weighted images. Heterogeneous contrast enhancement was seen on these areas. In addition, at the C7-Th5 vertebrae levels, spinal cord had diffuse increased signal intensity and contrast enhancement. Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis was thought based on clinical and radiological findings. Steroid therapy was started. Significant improvement was shown after treatment. On 2-year follow-up, there was no recurrence. In conclusion, it must be kept in mind that acute disseminated encephalomyelitis can rarely present with biparieto-occipital involvement which extends to corpus callosum and can mimic adrenoleukodystrophy.

833,2-s2.0-84896319455,Genetic inactivation of PERK signaling in mouse oligodendrocytes: Normal developmental myelination with increased susceptibility to inflammatory demyelination,"<p>The immune-mediated central nervous system (CNS) demyelinating disorder multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common neurological disease in young adults. One important goal of MS research is to identify strategies that will preserve oligodendrocytes (OLs) in MS lesions. During active myelination and remyelination, OLs synthesize large quantities of membrane proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), which may result in ER stress. During ER stress, pancreatic ER kinase (PERK) phosphorylates eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2α (elF2α), which activates the integrated stress response (ISR), resulting in a stress-resistant state. Previous studies have shown that PERK activity is increased in OLs within the demyelinating lesions of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a model of MS. Moreover, our laboratory has shown that PERK protects OLs from the adverse effects of interferon-γ, a key mediator of the CNS inflammatory response. Here, we have examined the role of PERK signaling in OLs during development and in response to EAE. We generated OL-specific PERK knockout (OL-PERK<sup>ko/ko</sup>) mice that exhibited a lower level of phosphorylated elF2α in the CNS, indicating that the ISR is impaired in the OLs of these mice. Unexpectedly, OL-PERK<sup>ko/ko</sup> mice develop normally and show no myelination defects. Nevertheless, EAE is exacerbated in these mice, which is correlated with increased OL loss, demyelination, and axonal degeneration. These data indicate that although not needed for developmental myelination, PERK signaling provides protection to OLs against inflammatory demyelination and suggest that the ISR in OLs could be a valuable target for future MS therapeutics. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p>"
834,2-s2.0-84896301689,Brain MRI of nasal MOG therapeutic effect in relapsing-progressive EAE,"<p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the central nervous system (CNS) considered to be a T cell-mediated autoimmune disease. Mucosally administered antigens induce regulatory T cells that secrete anti-inflammatory cytokines at the anatomic site where the mucosally administered Ag is located. We have previously reported in a mouse model of stroke that nasal treatment with MOG<sub>35-55</sub> peptide reduces ischemic infarct size and improves behavior, by inducing IL-10-secreting T cells. We have also demonstrated that an experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model in non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice leads to a relapsing progressive disease and that brain lesions can be visualized noninvasively by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Here, we investigated whether nasal treatment with 25μg of MOG<sub>35-55</sub> after the first attack affects clinical progression and MRI outcome in the NOD model. We found that nasal MOG<sub>35-55</sub> treatment administered three times after the first attack and then weekly reduced both the peak clinical disease score and clinical score during remission. Pathology revealed less infiltration of cells and reduction in white-matter damage as measured by Luxol blue staining in treated animals. This model is unique in that there are lesions in the corpus callosum, external capsule, fimbria, internal capsule and thalamus, which is analogous to what is observed in MS. MRI of individual animals using fractional anisotropy (FA) and T1-gadolinum (T1-Gd) imaging was able to identify lesions in all of these anatomic areas, and we found lower levels of brain pathology by MRI in treated mice with both methods. Our results indicate a beneficial effect of nasal MOG on relapsing-progressive EAE and demonstrate that non-invasive MRI imaging may be used to monitor treatment of ongoing disease in this model for testing new therapies for MS. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.</p>"
835,2-s2.0-84895743885,"The relationship between total and regional corpus callosum atrophy, cognitive impairment and fatigue in multiple sclerosis patients","<p>Objective: The objective of this paper is to investigate the relationship between total and regional corpus callosum (CC) atrophy, neuropsychological test performance and fatigue in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study in 113 MS patients: mean age 48±11 years, 75/113 women, 84/113 relapsing-remitting MS, mean disease duration 21±9 years, mean Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score 3.2±1.7. All patients underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging, standardised neurological assessment and comprehensive cognitive testing including assessments for fatigue and depression. Total and regional CC atrophy was assessed using the corpus callosum index (CCI). Results: CCI correlated more strongly with T2- and T1-lesion volume and whole brain volume than with disease duration or EDSS score. CCI correlated strongly with the verbal fluency test (VFT), Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) and Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT). Multivariate regression analysis revealed that atrophy of the posterior CC segment was significantly associated with poor outcome in the PASAT, VFT and SDMT. In contrast, atrophy of the anterior CC segment was significantly associated with fatigue severity and poor outcome in the long-term memory test. Conclusions: Atrophy of the CC is associated with cognitive impairment and fatigue. Regional CCI results indicate that these associations are partially spatially segregated. © 2014 The Author(s).</p>"
836,2-s2.0-84894444993,Graph theoretical analysis indicates cognitive impairment in MS stems from neural disconnection,"<p>Background The mechanisms underlying cognitive impairment in MS are still poorly understood. However, due to the specific pathology of MS, one can expect alterations in connectivity leading to physical and cognitive impairment. Aim In this study we aimed at assessing connectivity differences in EEG between cognitively impaired (CI) and cognitively preserved (CP) MS patients. We also investigated the influence of the measures used to construct networks. Methods We included 308 MS patients and divided them into two groups based on their cognitive score. Graph theoretical network analyses were conducted based on networks constructed using different connectivity measures, i.e. correlation, correlation in the frequency domain, coherence, partial correlation, the phase lag index and the imaginary part of coherency. The most commonly encountered network parameters were calculated and compared between the two groups using Wilcoxon's rank test. Clustering coefficients and path lengths were normalized to a randomized mean clustering coefficient and path length for each patient. False discovery rate was used to correct for the multiple comparisons and Cohen's d effect sizes are reported. Results Coherence analysis suggests that theta and delta connectivity is significantly smaller in cognitively impaired patients. Small-worldness differences are found in networks based on correlation, theta and delta coherence and correlation in the frequency domain. Modularity was related to age but not to cognition. Conclusion Cognitive deterioration in MS is a symptom that seems to be caused by neural disconnections, probably the white matter tracts connecting both hemispheres, and leads to a wide range in network differences which can be assessed by applying GTA to EEG data. In the future, these results may lead to cheaper and more objective assessments of cognitive impairment in MS. © 2014 The Authors.</p>"

OBSERVATIONS: We describe the case of a woman in her late 30s with a diagnosis of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis, who continued to accumulate neurological disability despite long-term natalizumab treatment. The patient continued to have visual symptoms, left leg weakness, and gait instability. In addition, she subacutely developed an encephalopathy. Our investigations revealed that the patient had a long-standing history of chewing on toilet bowl deodorizing cakes. The main ingredient in this product is 99.9% paradichlorobenzene, which is also used in mothballs. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This case illustrates that environmental causes for neurological deterioration should be investigated in patients with multiple sclerosis who display a rapidly progressive disease course and in whom potent pharmacotherapies fail. One possible cause is the ingestion of paradichlorobenzene-containing mothballs and toilet cleaners. © Copyright 2014 American Medical Association. All rights reserved.</p>"

839,2-s2.0-84890878730,Assessment of trace elements in human brain using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry,"<p>Recent brain research reveals a major role of trace elements in various diseases such as multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's and Wilson's disease. The majority of published tissue concentrations dates back decades, and was assessed with various methods. Little is known about hemispherical differences, the correlation of trace elements or age-dependent changes in the human brain. Thus, the aim of this study was to examine trace element concentrations in different human brain regions after whole brain formalin fixation.549 samples of 13 brain regions were investigated in 11 deceased subjects without known history of brain pathology. Regional wet-to-dry mass ratios and concentrations of iron, copper, magnesium, manganese, calcium and zinc were determined using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry.Cortical gray matter revealed higher water content (wet-to-dry mass ratios 5.84-6.40) than white matter regions (wet-to-dry mass ratios 2.95-3.05). Element concentrations displayed specific regional differences. Good linear correlation of concentrations between elements was found for iron/copper as well as for manganese/magnesium (Spearman's rank correlation coefficient 0.74 and 0.65, respectively). Significant inter-hemispherical differences were found for copper in occipital white matter, for magnesium and calcium in putamen and for iron and copper in temporal white matter. An age dependent increase was seen in cortical gray matter for calcium, for magnesium in all regions except in cortical gray matter, for copper in substantia nigra and for zinc in occipital cortex.The presented trace element concentrations can serve as a fundamental basis for further brain research. Wet-to-dry mass ratios allow a comparison with reference data from other studies. © 2013 Elsevier GmbH.</p>"
840,2-s2.0-84893576920,Deep gray matter demyelination detected by magnetization transfer ratio in the cuprizone model,"<p>In multiple sclerosis (MS), the correlation between lesion load on conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and clinical disability is weak. This clinico-radiological paradox might partly be due to the low sensitivity of conventional MRI to detect gray matter demyelination. Magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) has previously been shown to detect white matter demyelination in mice. In this study, we investigated whether MTR can detect gray matter demyelination in cuprizone exposed mice. A total of 54 female C57BL/6 mice were split into one control group () and eight cuprizone exposed groups (Ns = 6). The mice were exposed to 0:2% (w/w) cuprizone for up to six weeks. MTR images were obtained at a 7 Tesla Bruker MR-scanner before cuprizone exposure, weekly for six weeks during cuprizone exposure, and once two weeks after termination of cuprizone exposure. Immunohistochemistry staining for myelin (anti-Proteolopid Protein) and oligodendrocytes (anti-Neurite Outgrowth Inhibitor Protein A) was obtained after each weekly scanning. Rates of MTR change and correlations between MTR values and histological findings were calculated in five brain regions. In the corpus callosum and the deep gray matter a significant rate of MTR value decrease was found, 0:96% per week (p &lt; .0001) and 0:39% per week (p &lt; .0001) respectively. The MTR values correlated to myelin loss as evaluated by immunohistochemistry (Corpus callosum: R<sup>2</sup> = .43, p &lt; .0001. Deep gray matter: R<sup>2</sup> = .21, p &lt; .001), but did not correlate to oligodendrocyte density. Significant results were not found in the cerebellum, the olfactory bulb or the cerebral cortex. This study shows that MTR can be used to detect demyelination in the deep gray matter, which is of particular interest for imaging of patients with MS, as deep gray matter demyelination is common in MS, and is not easily detected on conventional clinical MRI. © 2013 Fjær et al.</p>"
841,2-s2.0-84890668327,Potential involvement of the extracranial venous system in central nervous system disorders and aging,"<p>Background: The role of the extracranial venous system in the pathology of central nervous system (CNS) disorders and aging is largely unknown. It is acknowledged that the development of the venous system is subject to many variations and that these variations do not necessarily represent pathological findings. The idea has been changing with regards to the extracranial venous system.Discussion: A range of extracranial venous abnormalities have recently been reported, which could be classified as structural/morphological, hemodynamic/functional and those determined only by the composite criteria and use of multimodal imaging. The presence of these abnormalities usually disrupts normal blood flow and is associated with the development of prominent collateral circulation. The etiology of these abnormalities may be related to embryologic developmental arrest, aging or other comorbidities. Several CNS disorders have been linked to the presence and severity of jugular venous reflux. Another composite criteria-based vascular condition named chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency (CCSVI) was recently introduced. CCSVI is characterized by abnormalities of the main extracranial cerebrospinal venous outflow routes that may interfere with normal venous outflow.Summary: Additional research is needed to better define the role of the extracranial venous system in relation to CNS disorders and aging. The use of endovascular treatment for the correction of these extracranial venous abnormalities should be discouraged, until potential benefit is demonstrated in properly-designed, blinded, randomized and controlled clinical trials.Please see related editorial: http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7015/11/259. © 2013 Zivadinov and Chung; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.</p>"

This ability called as mentalization (Theory of Mind) may become deficient and contribute to everyday life difficulties in multiple sclerosis. We aimed to explore the impact of brain pathology on mentalization performance in multiple sclerosis. Mentalization performance of 49 patients with multiple sclerosis was compared to 24 age- and gender matched healthy controls. T1- and T2-weighted three-dimensional brain MRI images were acquired at 3Tesla from patients with multiple sclerosis and 18 gender- and age matched healthy controls. We assessed overall brain cortical thickness in patients with multiple sclerosis and the scanned healthy controls, and measured the total and regional T1 and T2 white matter lesion volumes in patients with multiple sclerosis. Performances in tests of recognition of mental states and emotions from facial expressions and eye gazes correlated with both total T1-lesion load and regional T1-lesion load of association fiber tracts interconnecting cortical regions related to visual and emotion processing (genu and splenium of corpus callosum, right inferior longitudinal fasciculus, right inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, uncinate fasciculus). Both of these tests showed correlations with specific cortical areas involved in emotion recognition from facial expressions (right and left fusiform face area, frontal eye filed), processing of emotions (right entorhinal cortex) and socially relevant information (left temporal pole). Thus, both disconnection mechanism due to white matter lesions and cortical thinning of specific brain areas may result in cognitive deficit in multiple sclerosis affecting emotion and mental state processing from facial expressions and contributing to everyday and social life difficulties of these patients. © 2013 Mike et al.</p>"
843,2-s2.0-84893789796,Modifications of electrophysiological parameters in patients with multiple sclerosis,"<p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most frequent disabling disease of the young adult. Progression of the disease must be documented in order to properly conduct the treatment. Transcranial magnetical stimulation is able to assess the function of the motor system. Corpus callosum lesions are relatively specific and frequent in MS. As transcallosal inhibition (TI) is able to evaluate interhemispheric interactions, it might be useful in assessing cortico-spinal function in MS patients. We have evaluated the central motor conduction time (CMCT), transcallosal inhibition latency (LTI) and duration (DTI) in 40 patients with MS and 18 healthy subjects. Both LTI and DTI showed significant changes in MS patients, proportionate to the degree of clinical impairment. DTI was more sensitive in detecting motor pathway pathology than CMCT (increased CMCT in 80% of patients while DTI was increased in 92.5% of patients). Analysis of TI is a useful and sensitive tool in evaluating motor involvement in MS. © 2013 IEEE.</p>"
844,2-s2.0-84890120483,The notch signaling pathway: Its role in focal CNS demyelination and apotransferrin-induced remyelination,"<p>Oligodendroglial damage and demyelination are common pathological features characterizing white matter and neurodegenerative disorders. Identifying the signaling pathways involved in myelin repair through oligodendroglial progenitor maturation is essential for the development of new therapies. This article investigated the role of the Notch signaling pathway in CNS demyelination and apotransferrin-induced remyelination in a focal lysolecithin-induced demyelination model in rats. Notch was found activated in Nestin-expressing neural progenitor cells and in NG2-expressing oligodendroglial precursor cells in the subventricular zone and corpus callosum of lysolecithin-demyelinated rats. Notch activation seemed to be driven by Jagged1, which led to a high expression of downstream gene Hes5 in the subventricular zone of demyelinated rats. Apotransferrin injection induced remyelination, while the injection of the γ-secretase inhibitor reversed this effect. In addition, 24 h after apotransferrin injection, evidence showed Notch activation concomitantly with an increase in F3/contactin levels and the up-regulation of the myelin-associated glycoprotein gene in the subventricular zone and corpus callosum of demyelinated rats. Collected evidence supports the participation of both canonical and non-canonical Notch signaling pathways in demyelination/remyelination. Notch activation was found to trigger Hes5 expression as a consequence of focal demyelination, which might promote oligodendroglial precursor cell proliferation. During apotransferrin-induced remyelination, Notch activation seemed to be mediated by the expression of F3/contactin, which might induce apotransferrin-mediated oligodendroglial maturation. Evidence of the participation of Notch signaling in the demyelination/remyelination process will help further understand demyelinating disorders such as Multiple Sclerosis and the use of aTf should be taken into consideration as a possible therapeutic intervention.

845,2-s2.0-84890059695,Cavitary lesions in multiple sclerosis: Multicenter study on twenty patients,"<p>Introduction Cavitary white matter changes are mainly described in leukodystrophies and especially in vanishing white matter disease. Large cavitary lesions are not typical for multiple sclerosis (MS). Methods We studied MS patients with large cavitary brain lesions. Patient characteristics, disease onset/duration/subtype, expanded disability status scale (EDSS), mini mental state (MMS), vanishing white matter disease genetic analysis, and MRI characteristics of the cavitary lesions were analyzed. Results Twenty patients were analyzed (6 men and 14 women). Mean age at disease onset was 37.6 (range 17-58). Mean disease duration was 10 years (range 2-20). Five patients had initial relapsing-remitting MS and nine patients had primary-progressive MS. Mean EDSS was 5.5 (range 2-8). Mean MMS was 20/30. Vanishing white matter disease genetic analysis was performed and negative in seven patients. Inferior corpus callosum lesions were seen in all patients with available sagittal FLAIR sequences. Cavitary lesions were strictly supratentorial, and located inside the diffuse leukoencephalopathy, with often a posterior predominance. Conclusion MS patients with large cavitary lesions seem to represent a MS subgroup, predominantly women, with relatively late disease onset, predominantly primary-progressive type, relatively high EDSS scores, and severe cognitive dysfunction. © 2013 Elsevier Masson SAS.

847,2-s2.0-84887472017,Molecular architecture of myelinated nerve fibers: Leaky paranodal junctions and paranodal dysmyelination,"<p>Myelinated nerve fibers have evolved to optimize signal propagation. Each myelin segment is attached to the axon by the unique paranodal axoglial junction (PNJ), a highly complex structure that serves to define axonal ion channel domains and to direct nodal action currents through adjacent nodes. Surprisingly, this junction does not entirely seal the paranodal myelin sheath to the axon and thus does not entirely isolate the perinodal space from the internodal periaxonal space. Rather the paranode is penetrated by extracellular pathways between the myelin sheath and the axolemma for movement of molecules and the flow of current to and from the internodal axon. This review summarizes past and current studies demonstrating these pathways and considers what functional roles they subserve. In addition, modern genetic engineering methods permit modification of individual PNJ constituents, which provides an opportunity to define their specific functions. One component in particular, the transverse bands, plays a key role in maintaining the structure and function of the PNJ. Loss of transverse bands results not in frank demyelination but rather in subtle dysmyelination, which causes significant functional impairment. The consequences of such subtle defects in the PNJ are considered along with the relevance of these studies to human diseases of myelin. © The Author(s) 2013.</p>"
848,2-s2.0-84887150064,Mobilization of progenitors in the subventricular zone to undergo oligodendrogenesis in the Theiler's virus model of multiple sclerosis: Implications for remyelination at lesions sites,"<p>Remyelination involves the generation of new myelin sheaths around axons, as occurs spontaneously in many multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions and other demyelinating diseases. When considering repairing a diseased brain, the adult mouse subventricular zone (SVZ) is of particular interest since the stem cells in this area can migrate and differentiate into the three major cell types in the central nervous system (CNS). In Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus-induced demyelinating disease (TMEV-IDD), we assessed the relative contribution of the SVZ to the remyelination in the corpus callosum at preclinical stages in this MS model. CNPase, MBP and Luxol Fast Blue staining revealed prominent demyelination 35days post-infection (dpi), concomitant with a strong staining in GFAP<sup>+</sup> type B astrocytes in the SVZ and the increased proliferation in this area. The migration of oligodendrocyte progenitors from the SVZ contributed to the remyelination observed at 60 dpi, evident through the number of APC<sup>+</sup>/BrdU<sup>+</sup> mature oligodendrocytes in the corpus callosum of infected animals. These data suggest that the inflammation induced by the Theiler's virus not only provokes strong preclinical demyelination but also, it is correlated with oligodendrocyte generation in the adult SVZ, cells that along with resident progenitor cells contribute to the prompt remyelination observed in the corpus callosum. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.</p>"
849,2-s2.0-84887131602,SPatial REgression Analysis of Diffusion tensor imaging (SPREAD) for longitudinal progression of neurodegenerative disease in individual subjects,"<p>Objectives: To develop a novel statistical method for analysis of longitudinal DTI data in individual subjects. Materials and Methods: The proposed SPatial REgression Analysis of Diffusion tensor imaging (SPREAD) method incorporates a spatial regression fitting of DTI data among neighboring voxels and a resampling method among data at different times. Both numerical simulations and real DTI data from healthy volunteers and multiple sclerosis (MS) patients were used in the study to evaluate this method. Results: Statistical inference based on SPREAD was shown to perform well through both group comparisons among simulated DTI data of individuals (especially when the group size is smaller than 5) and longitudinal comparisons of human DTI data within the same individual. Conclusions: When pathological changes of neurodegenerative diseases are heterogeneous in a population, SPREAD provides a unique way to assess abnormality during disease progression at the individual level. Consequently, it has the potential to shed light on how the brain has changed as a result of disease or injury. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.</p>"
850,2-s2.0-84880333102,Diffusion tensor imaging based network analysis detects alterations of neuroconnectivity in patients with clinically early relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis,"<p>Although it is inarguable that conventional MRI (cMRI) has greatly contributed to the diagnosis and assessment of multiple sclerosis (MS), cMRI does not show close correlation with clinical findings or pathologic features, and is unable to predict prognosis or stratify disease severity. To this end, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) with tractography and neuroconnectivity analysis may assist disease assessment in MS. We, therefore, attempted this pilot study for initial assessment of early relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS). Neuroconnectivity analysis was used for evaluation of 24 early RRMS patients within 2 years of presentation, and compared to the network measures of a group of 30 age-and-gender-matched normal control subjects. To account for the situation that the connections between two adjacent regions may be disrupted by an MS lesion, a new metric, network communicability, was adopted to measure both direct and indirect connections. For each anatomical area, the brain network communicability and average path length were computed and compared to characterize the network changes in efficiencies. Statistically significant (P &lt; 0.05) loss of communicability was revealed in our RRMS cohort, particularly in the frontal and hippocampal/parahippocampal regions as well as the motor strip and occipital lobes. Correlation with the 25-foot Walk test with communicability measures in the left superior frontal (r = -0.71) as well as the left superior temporal gyrus (r = -0.43) and left postcentral gyrus (r = -0.41) were identified. Additionally identified were increased communicability between the deep gray matter structures (left thalamus and putamen) with the major interhemispheric and intrahemispheric white matter tracts, the corpus callosum, and cingulum, respectively. These foci of increased communicability are thought to represent compensatory changes. The proposed DTI-based neuroconnectivity analysis demonstrated quantifiable, structurally relevant alterations of fiber tract connections in early RRMS and paves the way for longitudinal studies in larger patient groups. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p>"
851,2-s2.0-84888096779,Encephalopathic Susac's Syndrome associated with livedo racemosa in a young woman before the completion of family planning,"<p>Background: Susac's Syndrome (SS) consists of the triad of encephalopathy, branch retinal artery occlusions (BRAO) and hearing loss (HL). Histopathologically, SS is characterised by a microangiopathy, and some observations suggest that an immune-mediated damage of endothelial cells might play a role. These findings also implicate a similarity between SS and other autoimmune diseases, most notably juvenile dermatomyositis (JDM). However, SS and JDM are commonly thought to affect distinct and non-overlapping sets of organs, and it is currently not clear how these specificities arise. Moreover, in the absence of clinical trials, some authors suggest that therapeutic approaches in SS should rely on the model of other autoimmune diseases such as JDM.Case presentation: Here, we report a case of SS in a 32-year-old pregnant woman. She initially was admitted to the hospital with subacute severe encephalopathy and multifocal neurologic signs. As cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed multifocal white matter lesions including the corpus callosum, erroneously a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis (MS) was made, and intravenous methylprednisolone (IVMP) therapy was initiated. A few days later, an exanthema appeared on the trunk and extremities, which was diagnosed as livedo racemosa (LR). Several weeks later, the patient was readmitted to the clinic with an obscuration of her left visual hemifield and a bilateral HL. Ophthalmologic examination revealed extensive ischemic damage to both retinae. Now the correct diagnosis of SS was established, based on the above triad of clinical symptoms in conjunction with typical MRI and fundoscopic findings. When SS was diagnosed, the standard therapy with intravenous cyclophosphamide (IVCTX) was not instituted because of a significant risk of permanent infertility. Instead, sustained control of disease activity could be achieved with a therapeutic regime combining prednisolone, intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG), mycophenylate mofetil (MM), and methotrexate (MTX).Conclusions: An association with LR has only been described in very few cases of SS before and further underlines the pathogenetic relationship between SS and other autoimmune diseases such as JDM. In young women with SS and the desire for a child the combination of MM and MTX may represent a reasonable alternative to IVCTX. © 2013 Engeholm et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.</p>"
852,2-s2.0-84887251187,"Enhanced accumulation of Kir4.1 protein, but not mRNA, in a murine model of cuprizone-induced demyelination","<p>Two channel proteins, inwardly rectifying potassium channel 4.1 (Kir4.1) and water channel aquaporin-4 (AQP4), were recently identified as targets of an autoantibody response in patients with multiple sclerosis and neuromyelitis optica, respectively. In the present study, we examined the expression patterns of Kir4.1 and AQP4 in a mouse model of demyelination induced by cuprizone, a copper chelator. Demyelination was confirmed by immunohistochemistry using an anti-proteolipid protein antibody in various brain regions, including the corpus callosum, of cuprizone-fed mice. Activation of microglial and astroglial cells was also confirmed by immunohistochemistry, using an anti-ionized calcium binding adapter molecule and a glial fibrillary acidic protein antibody. Western blot analysis revealed the induction of Kir4.1 protein, but not AQP4, in the cortex of cuprizone-fed mice. Immunohistochemical analysis confirmed the Kir4.1 protein induction in microvessels of the cerebral cortex. Real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed that mRNA levels of Kir4.1 and AQP4 in the cortex did not change during cuprizone administration. These findings suggest that enhanced accumulation of Kir4.1 protein in the brain with an inflammatory condition facilitates the autoantibody formation against Kir4.1 in patients with multiple sclerosis. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.</p>"
853,2-s2.0-84893507025,"Therapeutic laquinimod treatment decreases inflammation, initiates axon remyelination, and improves motor deficit in a mouse model of multiple sclerosis","<p>Background: Therapeutic strategies that induce effective neuroprotection and enhance intrinsic repair mechanisms are central goals for future treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS), as well as other diseases. Laquinimod (LQ) is an orally administered, central nervous system (CNS)-active immunomodulator with demonstrated efficacy in MS clinical trials and a favorable safety and tolerability profile. Aims: We aimed to explore the pathological, functional, and behavioral consequences of prophylactic and therapeutic (after presentation of peak clinical disease) LQ treatment in the chronic experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mouse model of MS. Materials and methods: Active EAE-induced 8-week-old C57BL/6 mice were treated with 5 or 25 mg/kg/day LQ via oral gavage beginning on EAE post-immunization day 0, 8, or 21. Clinical scores and rotorod motor performance were assessed throughout the disease course. Immune analysis of autoantigen-stimulated splenocytes, electrophysiological conduction of callosal axons, and immunohistochemistry of white matter-rich corpus callosum and spinal cord were performed. Results: Prophylactic and therapeutic treatment with LQ significantly decreased mean clinical disease scores, inhibited Th1 cytokine production, and decreased the CNS inflammatory response. LQ-induced improvement in axon myelination and integrity during EAE was functional, as evidenced by significant recovery of callosal axon conduction and axon refractoriness and pronounced improvement in rotorod motor performance. These improvements correlate with LQ-induced attenuation of EAE-induced demyelination and axon damage, and improved myelinated axon numbers. Discussion: Even when initiated at peak disease, LQ treatment has beneficial effects within the chronic EAE mouse model. In addition to its immunomodulatory effects, the positive effects of LQ treatment on oligodendrocyte numbers and myelin density are indicative of significant, functional neuroprotective and neurorestorative effects. Conclusions: Our results support a potential neuroprotective, in addition to immunomodulatory, effect of LQ treatment in inhibiting ongoing MS/EAE disease progression. © 2013 The Authors.</p>"
854,2-s2.0-84890806300,Longitudinal positron emission tomography imaging for monitoring myelin repair in the spinal cord,"<p>Objective Novel therapeutic interventions aimed at myelin repair are now under development for neuroprotection as well as functional recovery of patients with multiple sclerosis. However, development of myelin repair therapy necessitates a noninvasive approach for measuring changes in myelin content in vivo in a quantitative fashion not yet possible using magnetic resonance imaging. For this reason, we developed a novel positron emission tomography (PET) probe, termed [<sup>11</sup>C]MeDAS, that is capable of longitudinally imaging central nervous system myelin content. Methods The binding properties of [<sup>11</sup>C]MeDAS for myelin were systematically evaluated by in vitro and in situ fluorescent staining of the spinal cord and the brain, and by in vivo competitive blocking studies. Longitudinal PET studies were conducted in 3 rat models involving acute focal neuroinflammation in the brain, lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC)-induced focal demyelination in the spinal cord, and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Image-guided myelin repair therapy was conducted in an LPC rat model using a mesenchymal stem cell-based hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). Biodistribution and acute toxicity studies of [<sup>11</sup>C]MeDAS were also conducted. Results MeDAS selectively stains myelin in the spinal cord and brain. Neuroinflammation did not affect [ <sup>11</sup>C]MeDAS uptake in the brain as long as the myelin sheaths remained intact. Longitudinal PET studies in LPC and EAE rat models demonstrate that [<sup>11</sup>C]MeDAS uptake changes correlate with associated myelin loss in the spinal cord. Furthermore, using [<sup>11</sup>C]MeDAS-PET, the efficacy of myelin repair therapy with HGF was longitudinally monitored in vivo. Interpretation [<sup>11</sup>C]MeDAS-PET is a promising imaging marker for monitoring myelin pathology in vivo, future applications of which in humans should be achievable. © 2013 American Neurological Association.</p>"
855,2-s2.0-84885949111,Quantitative MRI and ultrastructural examination of the cuprizone mouse model of demyelination,"<p>The cuprizone mouse model of demyelination was used to investigate the influence that white matter changes have on different magnetic resonance imaging results. In vivo T<sub>2</sub>-weighted and magnetization transfer images (MTIs) were acquired weekly in control (n=5) and cuprizone-fed (n=5) mice, with significant increases in signal intensity in T<sub>2</sub>-weighted images (p&lt;0.001) and lower magnetization transfer ratio (p&lt;0.001) in the corpus callosum of the cuprizone-fed mice starting at 3weeks and peaking at 4 and 5weeks, respectively. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), quantitative MTI (qMTI), and T<sub>1</sub>/T<sub>2</sub> measurements were used to analyze freshly excised tissue after 6weeks of cuprizone administration. In multicomponent T<sub>2</sub> analysis with 10ms echo spacing, there was no visible myelin water component associated with the short T<sub>2</sub> value. Quantitative MTI metrics showed significant differences in the corpus callosum and external capsule of the cuprizone-fed mice, similar to previous studies of multiple sclerosis in humans and animal models of demyelination. Fractional anisotropy was significantly lower and mean, axial, and radial diffusivity were significantly higher in the cuprizone-fed mice. Cellular distributions measured in electron micrographs of the corpus callosum correlated strongly to several different quantitative MRI metrics. The largest Spearman correlation coefficient varied depending on cellular type: T<sub>1</sub> versus the myelinated axon fraction (ρ=-0.90), the bound pool fraction (f{hook}) versus the myelin sheath fraction (ρ=0.93), and axial diffusivity versus the non-myelinated cell fraction (ρ=0.92). Using Pearson's correlation coefficient, f{hook} was strongly correlated to the myelin sheath fraction (r=0.98) with a linear equation predicting myelin content (5.37f{hook}-0.25). Of the calculated MRI metrics, f{hook} was the strongest indicator of myelin content, while longitudinal relaxation rates and diffusivity measurements were the strongest indicators of changes in tissue structure. copy; 2013 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.</p>"

The definitions of multiple sclerosis (MS) and of the related clinically isolated syndromes (CIS) and acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) have been recently revised leading to a new consensus definition. However, other entities with similarities to these diseases may also develop with monophasic or relapsing white matter inflammation. These conditions include congenital immunogenetic diseases (such as hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis), vasculitis, and autoantibody-mediated encephalopathies (Hashimoto encephalopathy, encephalitis with anti-N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antibodies and neuromyelitis optica). Moreover, infectious diseases, such as Lyme disease, tumors (oligodendroglioma and lymphoma), and even genetic or metabolic diseases should also be considered if the clinical course of the disease does not follow the typical pattern for ADEM or MS. This short review describes these different entities and provides information for the differential diagnosis of inflammatory diseases of the white matter. © 2013 Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart.</p>"

In general MS patients with progressive disease respond poorly to anti-inflammatory therapies. In order to better understand the mechanism by which methotrexate is protective in progressive MS, we analyzed its impact on the non-inflammatory cuprizone-induced demyelination model. When low-dose methotrexate was administered intracerebroventricularly it reduced demyelination and accumulation of GFAP+ reactive astrocytes in the corpus callosum. Administration of methotrexate after the withdrawal of cuprizone neither delayed remyelination nor influenced the number of astrocytes in the corpus callosum suggesting that methotrexate does not interfere with repair processes in the CNS. Moreover, methotrexate increased the expression of IGF1 in vitro and in vivo, a factor known to protect oligodendrocytes and limit the activation of astrocytes. Our studies show that methotrexate has an impact on pathogenic process in a demyelination model whose pathophysiological basis is not primarily related to inflammatory mechanisms, similar to neurodegenerative mechanisms associated with progressive MS. The pronounced inhibitory influence of methotrexate on the accumulation of astrocytes in the corpus callosum suggests that intrathecal methotrexate modulates astroglial activation in progressive MS possibly by promoting CNS production of IGF1. © 2013 Mueller, Nassery, Conlon, Liu, Jun, Yoon, Cristofanilli and Sadiq.</p>"

A clinical and 3 tesla MRI study,"<p>Background: Executive dysfunction in multiple sclerosis varies in relation to the course of the disease and therapy and could be correlated with 3- tesla MRI. Objective: Compare aspects of executive dysfunction and memory in RRMS and SPMS and interferon and non interferon treated patients correlating findings with 3 -tesla MRI brain images. Methods: Thirty MS patients were included [25 RRMS and 5SPMS] 16 of them receive interferon were subjected to neurological, EDSS, fatigue severity scale, Beck depression Inventory assessment. In addition, neuropsychological assessment of memory, learning and executive dysfunctions. A 3- tesla MRI brain imaging within 48 hours of the assessment. Ten healthy age, sex and educational level matched controls were selected for comparison of the psychometric results. Results: Patients with RRMS showed no significant change in memory tests while those with SPMS showed significant worse performance in the executive functions test.Patients on interferon therapy showed preserved good performance in verbal and visuospatial learning when compared with the non treated patients. The corpus callosum thickness was significantly correlated with processing speed, verbal learning and verbal fluency. The brain parenchyma was significantly correlated with ability to display flexibility in the face of changing schedules. The 3<sup>rd</sup> ventricle width was significantly negatively correlated with visuospatial learning. Conclusion: Patients with MS exhibit different patterns of affection of their executive functions and memory in different courses of the disease.

For colitis, cysteamine (400 mg/kg intrarectally (1 ml/rat)) and colon-colon anastomosis (sacrifice at day 3, 5, 7, and 14) were used. BPC 157 (10 μg/kg, 10 ng/kg) was applied either intraperitoneally once time daily (first application immediately after surgery, last at 24 hours before sacrifice) or per-orally in drinking water (0.16 μg/ml/12 ml/day till the sacrifice) while controls simultaneously received an equivolume of saline (5 ml/kg) intraperitoneally or drinking water only (12 ml/day). A multiple sclerosis suited toxic rat model, cuprizone (compared with standard, a several times higher regimen, 2.5% of diet regimen + 1 g/kg intragastrically/day) was combined with BPC 157 (in drinking water 0.16 μg or 0.16 ng/ml/12 ml/day/rat + 10 μg or 10 ng/kg intragastrically/day) till the sacrifice at day 4. In general, the controls could not heal cysteamine colitis and colon-colon anastomosis. BPC 157 induced an efficient healing of both at the same time. Likewise, cuprizone-controls clearly exhibited an exaggerated and accelerated damaging process; nerve damage appeared in various brain areas, with most prominent damage in corpus callosum, laterodorsal thalamus, nucleus reunions, anterior horn motor neurons. BPC 157-cuprizone rats had consistently less nerve damage in all damaged areas, especially in those areas that otherwise were most affected. Consistently, BPC 157 counteracted cerebellar ataxia and impaired forelimb function. Thereby, this experimental evidence advocates BPC 157 in both inflammatory bowel disease and multiple sclerosis therapy.</p>"

Methods: Twenty-seven patients who met diagnostic criteria for RIS were collected. Sixteen age-and sex-matched healthy controls with normal neurologic examination findings and no history of neurologic or psychopathic disorders were included. All subjects were examined by both conventional scan and DTI scan on GE Signa 3. 0 T MRI. All the images were transmitted to the Advantage Workstation 4. 2P and postprocessed using functool software. Anisotropic maps and average diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps were reconstructed. Two ROIs were selected in the genu and splenium of the corpus callosum separately at the trigone of lateral ventricle level. Other 2 ROIs were selected in the anterior and posterior body of the corpus callosum separately at the level of the lateral ventricle body, and 1 ROI was selected in the white matter of bilateral frontal and occipital lobe separately, then the FA and MD values were measured. The diffusion indices (FA and MD) were analysed by SPSS 13.0. Independent-sample t test was performed to examine the group differences in each subregion. Intraclass correlation coefficient analysis was performed to assess the diffusion indices of two measurements in each subregion. Results: The ICC of 2 measurements was 0.934-0.989 (P &lt; 0.01), which showed favorable consistency. The FA values were decreased obviously in the genu, anterior and posterior body of the corpus callosum of the RIS patients compared with controls (0.705 ± 0.040 vs 0.738 ± 0.045, 0.632 ± 0.043 vs 0.675 ± 0.042, 0.628 ± 0.043 vs 0.666 ± 0.045, t = -3.526, -4.487, -3.890, P &lt; 0.01), but the FA values of the two groups did not show any significant difference in the splenium, the white matter of the frontal and occipital lobe respectively (t = -1.387, -0.683, -1.243, P &gt; 0.05). In comparison with controls, the RIS patients had increased MD values in the genu, anterior and posterior body of the corpus callosum.

862,2-s2.0-84887206057,Regional regulation of glutamate signaling during cuprizone-induced demyelination in the brain,"<p>Glutamate excitotoxicity is associated with a wide range of neurodegenerative disorders and also seems to be involved in the pathology of demyelinating disorders such as multiple sclerosis (MS). Cuprizone-induced toxic demyelination shows clear characteristics of MS such as demyelination and axonal damage without the involvement of the innate immune system. In this study, we have evaluated glutamate signaling during cuprizone-induced demyelination in the white and gray matter of mouse brain by studying the expression of ionotropic and metabotropic glutamate-receptors and -transporters by Affymetrix gene array analysis, followed by real-time PCR and western blot analysis. Cellular localization of glutamate transporters was investigated by fluorescence double-labeling experiments. Comparing white and gray matter areas, the expression of glutamate receptors was region-specific. Among NMDA receptor subunits, NR2A was up-regulated in the demyelinated corpus callosum (CC), whereas the metabotropic glutamate receptor mGluR2 was down-regulated in demyelinated gray matter. Glutamate-aspartate transporter (GLAST) co-localizing with GFAP<sup>+</sup> astrocytes was increased in both demyelinated CC and telencephalic cortex, whereas Slc1a4 transporter was up-regulated only in CC. Our data indicate that cuprizone treatment affects glutamate-receptors and -transporters differently in gray and white matter brain areas revealing particularly regulation of GLAST and Slc1a4 compared with other genes. This might have an important influence on brain-region selective sensitivity to neurotoxic compounds and the progression of demyelination as has been reported for MS and other demyelinating neurological diseases. © 2013 Elsevier GmbH.</p>"

In this study, we employed the murine cuprizone model of demyelination, in which remyelination occurs after removal of the toxin from the diet, to examine the cellular and molecular changes during demyelination and remyelination. Microglia accumulated in the corpus callosum during weeks 2-4 of the cuprizone diet, and these cells remained activated 2 weeks after the change to the normal diet. To examine the role of microglia in remyelination, mice were treated with minocycline to inactivate these cells after cuprizone-induced demyelination. Minocycline treatment reduced the number of CC1-positive oligodendrocytes, as well as levels of myelin basic protein (MBP) and CNPase in the remyelination phase. The expression of CNTF mRNA in the corpus callosum increased after 4 weeks on the cuprizone diet and remained high 2 weeks after the change to the normal diet. Minocycline suppressed CNTF expression during the remyelination phase on the normal diet. Primary culture experiments showed that CNTF was produced by microglia in addition to astrocytes. In vitro, CNTF directly affected the differentiation of oligodendrocytic cells. These findings suggest that minocycline reduces remyelination by suppressing CNTF expression by microglia after cuprizone-induced demyelination. To examine the role of microglia in remyelination, mice were treated with minocycline after cuprizone-induced demyelination.

864,2-s2.0-84885396979,Early white matter changes in childhood multiple sclerosis: A diffusion tensor imaging study,"<p>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Loss of integrity in nonlesional white matter occurs as a fundamental feature of multiple sclerosis in adults. The purpose of our study was to evaluate DTI-derived measures of white matter microstructure in children with MS compared with age- and sex-matched controls by using tract-based spatial statistics. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fourteen consecutive pediatric patients with MS (11 female/3 male; mean age, 15.1 ± 1.6 years; age range, 12-17 years) and age- and sex-matched healthy subjects (11 female/3 male; mean age, 14.8 ± 1.7 years) were included in the study. After we obtained DTI sequences, data processing was performed by using tract-based spatial statistics. RESULTS: Compared with healthy age- and sex-matched controls, children with multiple sclerosis showed a global decrease in mean fractional anisotropy (P ≤ .001), with a concomitant increase in mean (P &lt; .001), radial (P &lt; .05), and axial diffusivity (P &lt; .001). The most pronounced fractional anisotropy value decrease in patients with MS was found in the splenium of the corpus callosum (P &lt; .001). An additional decrease in fractional anisotropy was identified in the right temporal and right and left parietal regions (P &lt; .001). Fractional anisotropy of the white matter skeleton was related to disease duration and may, therefore, serve as a diagnostic marker. CONCLUSIONS: The microstructure of white matter is altered early in the disease course in childhood multiple sclerosis.</p>"
865,2-s2.0-84885190381,Cuprizone-induced demyelination as a tool to study remyelination and axonal protection,"<p>In the brain of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients, the conduction block of axons due to demyelination and inflammation underlies early neurological symptoms, whereas axonal transection accounts for permanent deficits occurring during later disease stages. The beneficial function of myelin for the protection of the axonal compartment and network stability between neurons has been shown in numerous studies. Thus, rapid and adequate remyelination is an important factor for axonal patronage during neuroinflammatory conditions. In this review article, we discuss frequently used experimental in vivo and in vitro animal models to examine remyelination and repair in MS. The focus of the discussion is the relevance of the toxin model 'cuprizone' to study the pathology of demyelination and the physiology of remyelination. This also includes recent findings in this animal model which implicate that axonal damage is an ongoing process independent of the initiation of endogenous remyelination. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.</p>"

867,2-s2.0-84884232199,Segmented corpus callosumdiffusivity correlateswith the Expanded Disability Status Scale score in the early stages of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis,"<p>Objective: The aim of this study was to characterize the microscopic damage to the corpus callosum in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) with diffusion tensor imaging and to investigate the correlation of this damage with disability. The diffusion tensor imaging parameters of fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity provide information about the integrity of cell membranes, offering two more specific indices, namely the axial and radial diffusivities, which are useful for discriminating axon loss from demyelination. Method: Brain magnetic resonance imaging exams of 30 relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis patients and 30 age- and sex-matched healthy controls were acquired in a 3T scanner. The axial diffusivities, radial diffusivities, fractional anisotropy, and mean diffusivity of five segments of the corpus callosum, correlated to the Expanded Disability Status Scale score, were obtained. Results: All corpus callosum segments showed increased radial diffusivities and mean diffusivity, as well as decreased fractional anisotropy, in the relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis group. The axial diffusivity was increased in the posterior midbody and splenium. The Expanded Disability Status Scale scores correlated more strongly with axial diffusivities and mean diffusivity, with an isolated correlation with radial diffusivities in the posterior midbody of the corpus callosum. There was no significant correlation with lesion loads. Conclusion: Neurological dysfunction in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis can be influenced by commissural disconnection, and the diffusion indices of diffusion tensor imaging are potential biomarkers of disability that can be assessed during follow-up. © 2013 CLINICS.</p>"

Normal-appearing white matter and GM, despite seeming normal in conventional mangnetic resonance imaging (MRI), are important loci of widespread inflammation, neuronal damage, and source of progressive disability in multiple sclerosis (MS). Dynamic PET imaging using A2AR-specific [ 11 C]TMSX and brain MRI with diffusion tensor imaging were performed to eight SPMS patients and seven healthy controls. Distribution volumes (V T) of [ 11 C]TMSX were analyzed from 13 regions of interest using Logan plot with arterial plasma input. The SPMS patients had significantly increased [ 11 C]TMSX-V T in NAWM compared with controls (mean (s.d.): 0.55 (±0.08) vs. 0.45 (±0.05); P=0.036). Both the increased V T and the decreased fractional anisotropy (FA) in NAWM were associated with higher expanded disability status scale (EDSS) scores (P=0.030 and P=0.012, respectively), whereas the T2-lesion load of SPMS patients did not correlate with EDSS. This study shows, that A2ARs are increased in the brain of SPMS patients, and that [ 11 C]TMSX-PET provides a novel approach to learn about central nervous system pathology in SPMS in vivo. © 2013 ISCBFM.</p>"
870,2-s2.0-84880135775,FGF2 and FGFR1 signaling regulate functional recovery following cuprizone demyelination,"<p>In demyelinating diseases, such as multiple sclerosis, remyelination offers the potential to recover function of viable denuded axons by restoring saltatory conduction and/or protecting from further damage. Mice with genetic reduction of fibroblast growth factor 2 (Fgf2) or Fgf receptor 1 (Fgfr1) exhibit dramatically improved remyelination following experimental demyelination with cuprizone. The current studies are the first to test neurobehavioral outcomes with these gene deletions that improved remyelination. The cuprizone protocols used did not produce overt abnormalities but did reduce bilateral sensorimotor coordination (complex wheel task) and increase sociability (two chamber apparatus with novel mouse). A significant effect of genotype was observed on the complex wheel task but not in the sociability apparatus. Specifically, complex wheel velocities for Fgf2 nulls improved significantly after removal of cuprizone from the diet. This improvement in Fgf2 null mice occurred following either acute (6 weeks) or chronic (12 weeks) demyelination. Plp/CreERT:Fgfr1<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice administered tamoxifen at 10 weeks of cuprizone treatment to induce Fgfr1 knockdown also showed improved recovery of running velocities on the complex wheels. Therefore, constitutive deletion of Fgf2 or Fgfr1 knockdown in oligodendrocyte lineage cells is sufficient to overcome impairment of sensorimotor coordination after cuprizone demyelination. © 2013 The Authors.</p>"

872,2-s2.0-84881639011,Current and new directions in MRI in multiple sclerosis,"<p>Purpose of Review: This article summarizes the use of MRI in the diagnosis and treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS). Current and emerging imaging techniques are reviewed pertaining to their utility in MS. Recent Findings: Conventional T1-weighted and T2-weighted sequences are used to identify and characterize disease pathology in MS. T2 lesion burden, postcontrast enhancement, T1 hypointensities, and regional and global atrophy are all informative and correlate to clinical measures, such as disease disability, to a variable extent. Newer techniques such as diffusion tensor imaging, magnetization transfer imaging, and MR spectroscopy are increasingly being incorporated into clinical trials and may provide improved specificity to the underlying pathology. Double inversion recovery and ultrahigh-field-strength MRI have direct application in MS for evaluating cortical pathology. Newer functional MRI techniques such as resting-state functional connectivity are increasingly being applied in MS. Summary: Conventional and emerging imaging techniques greatly inform our understanding of MS. These techniques are integral in diagnosis, in evaluating new treatments for MS, and for following patients in the clinical setting. © 2013, American Academy of Neurology.</p>"
873,2-s2.0-84881543062,Investigating the role of the corpus callosum in regulating motor overflow in multiple sclerosis,"<p>Abstract: The corpus callosum (CC) is commonly affected in multiple sclerosis (MS), however, sensitive behavioral measures of MS-related CC pathology are lacking. The CC is considered a key structure in the mediation of a type of involuntary movement known as motor overflow. In this study, we sought to characterize the impact of CC damage on motor overflow in MS. Twenty MS participants and 20 controls performed a unilateral force production task. Motor overflow (involuntary force) in the non-active hand was measured while the active hand performed the task. CC volume and lesion load were calculated for MS participants using T2-weighted MRI. We found no group differences in motor overflow; however, motor overflow correlated significantly with MS disease severity [Expanded disability status scale (EDSS)]. CC damage (lesions and decreased volume) did not correlate with motor overflow. This study suggests that CC damage may not directly lead to changes in the regulation of motor overflow. Rather, findings support the notion that a wider network of structures may mediate the production and suppression of motor overflow. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.</p>"
874,2-s2.0-84880697263,Astrogliopathy and oligodendrogliopathy are early events in CNS demyelination,"<p>We examined the phenotypic composition of cells and the underlying mechanisms of demyelination following injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) into the corpus callosum of rats. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay showed fragmented DNA, which co-localized with oligodendrocytes in areas of demyelination following intracerebral injection with LPS. Immunostaining showed the presence of caspase 3 in cells which expressed the oligodendrocyte markers, suggesting activation of the apoptotic pathway. Commensurate reduction in glial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP)+/ gap junction protein connexin43+ (Cx43) cells, was also seen in the corpus callosum prior to histochemical evidence of demyelination. Expression of mRNA for proinflammatory cytokines was maximal 3 day postinjection, at a time when the numbers of TUNEL positive cells in the corpus callosum were declining and the total number of CD68+ cells peaked at day 14 postinjection. Our studies suggest that death of oligodendrocytes is an early event in LPS model of demyelination. We believe that the innate immune model of oligodendrocyte death will be useful in the development of neuroprotective agents capable of rescuing oligodendrocytes from apoptosis. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc., a Wiley company.</p>"

Using experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a mouse model of MS, we have previously shown that prophylactic administration of the estrogen receptor (ER) β ligand 2,3-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)-propionitrile (DPN) decreases clinical disease, is neuroprotective, stimulates endogenous myelination, and improves axon conduction without altering peripheral cytokine production or reducing central nervous system (CNS) inflammation. Here, we assessed the effects of therapeutic DPN treatment during peak EAE disease, which represents a more clinically relevant treatment paradigm. In addition, we investigated the mechanism of action of DPN treatment-induced recovery during EAE. Given that prophylactic and therapeutic treatments with DPN during EAE improved remyelination-induced axon conduction, and that ER (α and β) and membrane (m)ERs are present on oligodendrocyte lineage cells, a direct effect of treatment on oligodendrocytes is likely. DPN treatment of EAE animals resulted in phosphorylated ERβ and activated the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/serine-threonine-specific protein kinase (Akt)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway, a pathway required for oligodendrocyte survival and axon myelination. These results, along with our previous studies of prophylactic DPN treatment, make DPN and similar ERβ ligands immediate and favorable therapeutic candidates for demyelinating disease. © 2013 Elsevier Inc..</p>"

Involvement of the central nervous system is seen in 4-13% of patients with brucellosis. A 13-year-old girl was admitted because of gait disturbance, diplopia, and dizziness. Her complaints began about 1.5 years ago. The second symptomatic episode repeated about three months ago and the third two months ago. In total, attacks repeated 3 times over 1.5 years. The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and the clinical features mimicked multiple sclerosis. The patient was given pulse steroid treatments. After steroid treatment, her gait disturbance and diplopia improved over the short term. Following positive developments, her symptoms recurred. The tests were repeated; the MRI showed increasingly high signal abnormalities, and Brucella melitensis was grown in cerebrospinal fluid. The patient was started on an oral combination of rifampin, doxycycline, and ciprofloxacin. MRI findings improved markedly after nine months of treatment. Although neurobrucellosis is associated rarely with demyelination in adults, this finding has not been reported previously in children or adolescents. Additionally, this case is the first in terms of involvement of the corpus callosum in neurobrucellosis. In this article, we present an unusual case of neurobrucellosis.</p>"
877,2-s2.0-84880562650,Intra-individual variability in information processing speed reflects white matter microstructure in multiple sclerosis,"<p>Slowed information processing speed is commonly reported in persons with multiple sclerosis (MS), and is typically investigated using clinical neuropsychological tests, which provide sensitive indices of mean-level information processing speed. However, recent studies have demonstrated that within-person variability or intra-individual variability (IIV) in information processing speed may be a more sensitive indicator of neurologic status than mean-level performance on clinical tests. We evaluated the neural basis of increased IIV in mildly affected relapsing-remitting MS patients by characterizing the relation between IIV (controlling for mean-level performance) and white matter integrity using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Twenty women with relapsing-remitting MS and 20 matched control participants completed the Computerized Test of Information Processing (CTIP), from which both mean response time and IIV were calculated. Other clinical measures of information processing speed were also collected. Relations between IIV on the CTIP and DTI metrics of white matter microstructure were evaluated using tract-based spatial statistics. We observed slower and more variable responses on the CTIP in MS patients relative to controls. Significant relations between white matter microstructure and IIV were observed for MS patients. Increased IIV was associated with reduced integrity in more white matter tracts than was slowed information processing speed as measured by either mean CTIP response time or other neuropsychological test scores. Thus, despite the common use of mean-level performance as an index of cognitive dysfunction in MS, IIV may be more sensitive to the overall burden of white matter disease at the microstructural level. Furthermore, our study highlights the potential value of considering within-person fluctuations, in addition to mean-level performance, for uncovering brain-behavior relationships in neurologic disorders with widespread white matter pathology. © 2013 The Authors.</p>"

879,2-s2.0-84880849959,Effects of Murine and Human Bone Marrow-Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells on Cuprizone Induced Demyelination,"<p>For the treatment of patients with multiple sclerosis there are no regenerative approaches to enhance remyelination. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) have been proposed to exert such regenerative functions. Intravenous administration of human MSC reduced the clinical severity of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model mimicking some aspects of multiple sclerosis. However, it is not clear if this effect was achieved by systemic immunomodulation or if there is an active neuroregeneration in the central nervous system (CNS). In order to investigate remyelination and regeneration in the CNS we analysed the effects of intravenously and intranasally applied murine and human bone marrow-derived MSC on cuprizone induced demyelination, a toxic animal model which allows analysis of remyelination without the influence of the peripheral immune system. In contrast to EAE no effects of MSC on de- and remyelination and glial cell reactions were found. In addition, neither murine nor human MSC entered the lesions in the CNS in this toxic model. In conclusion, MSC are not directed into CNS lesions in the cuprizone model where the blood-brain-barrier is intact and thus cannot provide support for regenerative processes. © 2013 Nessler et al.</p>"
880,2-s2.0-84880162763,The benefits and detriments of macrophages/microglia in models of multiple sclerosis,"<p>The central nervous system (CNS) is immune privileged with access to leukocytes being limited. In several neurological diseases, however, infiltration of immune cells from the periphery into the CNS is largely observed and accounts for the increased representation of macrophages within the CNS. In addition to extensive leukocyte infiltration, the activation of microglia is frequently observed. The functions of activated macrophages/microglia within the CNS are complex. In three animal models of multiple sclerosis (MS), namely, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) and cuprizone- and lysolecithin-induced demyelination, there have been many reported detrimental roles associated with the involvement of macrophages and microglia. Such detriments include toxicity to neurons and oligodendrocyte precursor cells, release of proteases, release of inflammatory cytokines and free radicals, and recruitment and reactivation of T lymphocytes in the CNS. Many studies, however, have also reported beneficial roles of macrophages/microglia, including axon regenerative roles, assistance in promoting remyelination, clearance of inhibitory myelin debris, and the release of neurotrophic factors. This review will discuss the evidence supporting the detrimental and beneficial aspects of macrophages/microglia in models of MS, provide a discussion of the mechanisms underlying the dichotomous roles, and describe a few therapies in clinical use in MS that impinge on the activity of macrophages/microglia. © 2013 Khalil S.

Objective To investigate the association between micro-structural damage in the anterior thalamic (AT) tracts and in the corpus callosum (CC), as measured by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) tractography, and fatigue and cognitive deficits. Methods DTI data were acquired from 26 BMS patients and 24 sex- and age-matched healthy controls. Results General and mental fatigue scores were significantly impaired in patients compared with controls (p ≤ 0.05 for both) and 38% of patients resulted cognitively impaired. Mean diffusivity (MD) of the AT and CC tracts was significantly higher and fractional anisotropy (FA) was lower in patients compared with controls (p &lt; 0.001 for all). Fatigue was associated with increased MD (p = 0.01) of the AT tracts whereas deficit of executive functions and verbal learning were associated with decreased FA in the body (p = 0.004) and genu (p = 0.008) of the CC. Deficits in processing speed and attention were associated with the T2 lesion volume of the AT tracts (p &lt; 0.01 for all). Discussion These findings suggest that fatigue and cognitive impairment are quite frequent in BMS patients and are, at least in part, related to micro-structural damage and T2LV of WM tracts connecting the brain cortical and sub-cortical regions of the two hemispheres. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.</p>"
882,2-s2.0-84880201366,"The relationship between executive functioning, processing speed, and white matter integrity in multiple sclerosis","<p>The primary purpose of the current study was to examine the relationship between performance on executive tasks and white matter integrity, assessed by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in multiple sclerosis (MS). A second aim was to examine how processing speed affects the relationship between executive functioning and fractional anisotropy (FA). This relationship was examined in two executive tasks that rely heavily on processing speed: the Color-Word Interference Test and the Trail Making Test (Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System). It was hypothesized that reduced FA is related to poor performance on executive tasks in MS, but that this relationship would be affected by the statistical correction of processing speed from the executive tasks. A total of 15 healthy controls and 25 persons with MS participated. Regression analyses were used to examine the relationship between executive functioning and FA, both before and after processing speed was removed from the executive scores. Before processing speed was removed from the executive scores, reduced FA was associated with poor performance on the Color-Word Interference Test and Trail Making Test in a diffuse network including corpus callosum and superior longitudinal fasciculus. However, once processing speed was removed, the relationship between executive functions and FA was no longer significant on the Trail Making Test, and significantly reduced and more localized on the Color-Word Interference Test. © 2013 Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC.</p>"
883,2-s2.0-84878844269,Loss of branched O-mannosyl glycans in astrocytes accelerates remyelination,"<p>In demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis, a critical problem is failure of remyelination, which is important for protecting axons against degeneration and restoring conduction deficits. However, the underlying mechanism of demyelination/remyelination remains unclear. N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase-IX (GnT-IX; also known as GnT-Vb) is a brain-specific glycosyltransferase that catalyzes the branched formation of O-mannosyl glycan structures. O-Mannosylation of α-dystroglycan is critical for its function as an extracellular matrix receptor, but the biological significance of its branched structures, which are exclusively found in the brain, is unclear. In this study, we found that GnT-IX formed branched O-mannosyl glycans on receptor protein tyrosine phosphataseβ (RPTPβ) in vivo. Since RPTPβ is thought to play a regulatory role in demyelinating diseases, GnT-IX-deficient mice were subjected to cuprizoneinduced demyelination. Cuprizone feeding for 8 weeks gradually promoted demyelination in wild-type mice. In GnT-IX-deficient mice, the myelin content in the corpus callosum was reduced after 4 weeks of treatment, but markedly increased at 8 weeks, suggesting enhanced remyelination under GnT-IX deficiency. Furthermore, astrocyte activation in the corpus callosum of GnT-IX-deficient mice was significantly attenuated, and an oligodendrocyte cell lineage analysis indicated that more oligodendrocyte precursor cells differentiated into mature oligodendrocytes. Together, branched O-mannosyl glycans in the corpus callosum in the brain are a necessary component of remyelination inhibition in the cuprizone-induced demyelination model, suggesting that modulation of O-mannosyl glycans is a likely candidate for therapeutic strategies. ©2013 the authors.</p>"
884,2-s2.0-84878474040,Ascl1/Mash1 promotes brain oligodendrogenesis during myelination and remyelination,"<p>Oligodendrocytes are the myelin-forming cells of the CNS. They differentiate from oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) that are produced from progenitors throughout life but more actively during the neonatal period and in response to demyelinating insults. An accurate regulation of oligodendrogenesis is required to generate oligodendrocytes during these developmental or repair processes. We hypothesized that this regulation implicates transcription factors, which are expressed by OPCs and/or their progenitors. Ascl1/Mash1 is a proneural transcription factor previously implicated in embryonic oligodendrogenesis and operating in genetic interaction with Olig2, an essential transcriptional regulator in oligodendrocyte development. Herein, we have investigated the contribution of Ascl1 to oligodendrocyte development and remyelination in the postnatal cortex. During the neonatal period, Ascl1 expression was detected in progenitors of the cortical subventricular zone and in cortical OPCs. Different genetic approaches to delete Ascl1 in cortical progenitors or OPCs reduced neonatal oligodendrogenesis, showing that Ascl1 positively regulated bothOPCspecification from subventricular zone progenitors as well as the balance betweenOPCdifferentiation and proliferation. Examination of remyelination processes, both in themousemodel for focal demyelination of the corpus callosum and in multiple sclerosis lesions in humans, indicated that Ascl1 activity was upregulated along with increased oligodendrogenesis observed in remyelinating lesions.

Recent work by Mani et al.1 describes a Riemannian framework in which these joint feature spaces are considered. In this paper, we use the tools and metrics defined within this mathematical framework to study morphological changes due to disease progression.

886,2-s2.0-84906303624,Promotion of remyelination by adipose mesenchymal stem cell transplantation in a cuprizone model of multiple sclerosis,"<p>Objective: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an immune-mediated demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS). Stem cell transplantation is a new therapeutic approach for demyelinating diseases such as MS which may promote remyelination. In this study, we evaluate the remyelinating potential of adipose mesenchymal stem cells (ADSCs) and their effect on neural cell composition in the corpus callosum in an experimental model of MS. Materials and Methods: This experimental study used adult male C57BL/6 mice. Cultured ADSCs were confirmed to be CD73<sup>+</sup>,CD90<sup>+</sup>, CD31<sup>-</sup>,CD45<sup>-</sup>, and labeled by PKH26. Animals were fed with 0.2% w/w cuprizone added to ground breeder chow ad libitum for six weeks. At day 0 after cuprizone removal, mice were randomly divided into two groups: the ADSCs-transplanted group and the control vehicle group (received medium alone). Some mice of the same age were fed with their normal diet to serve as healthy control group. Homing of ADSCs in demyelinated lesions was examined by flourescent microscope. At ten days after transplantation, the mice were euthanized and their cells analyzed by luxol fast blue staining (LFB), transmission electron microscopy and flow cytometry. Results were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Results: According to Fluorescent cell labeling, transplanted ADSCs appeared to survive and exhibited homing specifity. LFB staining and transmission electron microscope evaluation revealed enhanced remyelination in the transplanted group compared to the control vehicle group. Flow cytometry analysis showedan increase in Olig2 and O4 cells and a decrease in GFAP and Iba-1 cells in the transplanted group. Counclusion: Our results indicate that ADSCs may provide a feasible, practical way for remyelination in diseases such as MS.</p>"
887,2-s2.0-84878902187,Multiple sclerosis susceptibility loci do not alter clinical and MRI outcomes in clinically isolated syndrome,"<p>It has not yet been established whether genetic predictors of multiple sclerosis (MS) susceptibility also influence disease severity and accumulation of disability. Our aim was to evaluate associations between 16 previously validated genetic susceptibility markers and MS phenotype. Patients with clinically isolated syndrome verified by positive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and cerebrospinal fluid findings (n=179) were treated with interferon-β. Disability and volumetric MRI parameters were evaluated regularly for 2 years. Sixteen single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) previously validated as predictors of MS susceptibility in our cohort and their combined weighted genetic risk score (wGRS) were tested for associations with clinical (conversion to MS, relapses and disability) and MRI disease outcomes (whole brain, grey matter and white matter volumes, corpus callosum cross-sectional area, brain parenchymal fraction, T2 and T1 lesion volumes) 2 years from disease onset using mixed-effect models. We have found no associations between the tested SNPs and the clinical or MRI outcomes. Neither the combined wGRS predicted MS activity and progression over 2-year follow-up period. Power analyses confirmed 90% power to identify clinically relevant changes in all outcome variables. We conclude that the most important MS susceptibility loci do not determine MS phenotype and disease outcomes. © 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.</p>"

889,2-s2.0-84877810365,Assessing the Correlation between Grey and White Matter Damage with Motor and Cognitive Impairment in Multiple Sclerosis Patients,"<p>Background: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is characterized by demyelinating and degenerative processes within the central nervous system. Unlike conventional MRI,new advanced imaging techniques improve pathological specificity and better highlight the relationship between anatomical damage and clinical impairment. Objective: To investigate the relationship between clinical disability and both grey (GM) and white matter (WM) regional damage in MS patients. Methods: Thirty-six relapsing remitting-MS patients and 25 sex- and age-matched controls were enrolled. All patients were clinically evaluated by the Expanded Disability Status Scale and the Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite (MSFC) scale, which includes the 9-hole peg test (9HPT), the timed 25-feet walking test (T25FW) and the paced auditory serial addition test (PASAT). All subjects were imaged by a 3.0 T scanner: dual-echo fast spin-echo, 3DT1-weighted and diffusion-tensor imaging (DTI) sequences were acquired. Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) analyses were run for regional GM and WM assessment, respectively. T2 lesion volumes were also calculated, by using a semi-automated technique. Results: Brain volumetric assessment of GM and DTI measures revealed significant differences between patients and controls. In patients, different measures of WM damage correlated each-other (p&lt;0.0001), whereas none of them correlated with GM volume. In patients, focal GM atrophy and widespread WM damage significantly correlated with clinical measures. In particular, VBM analysis revealed a significant correlation (p&lt;0.05) between GM volume and 9HPT in cerebellum and between GM volume and PASAT in orbito-frontal cortex. TBSS showed significant correlations between DTI metrics with 9HPT and PASAT scores in many WM bundles (p&lt;0.05), including corpus callosum, internal capsule, posterior thalamic radiations, cerebral peduncles. Conclusions: Selective GM atrophy and widespread WM tracts damage are associated with functional impairment of upper-limb motion and cognition. The combined analysis of volumetric and DTI data may help to better understand structural alterations underlying physical and cognitive dysfunction in MS. © 2013 Sbardella et al.</p>"

891,2-s2.0-84877076020,Investigation of Sequential Growth Factor Delivery during Cuprizone Challenge in Mice Aimed to Enhance Oligodendrogliogenesis and Myelin Repair,"<p>Repair in multiple sclerosis involves remyelination, a process in which axons are provided with a new myelin sheath by new oligodendrocytes. Bone morphogenic proteins (BMPs) are a family of growth factors that have been shown to influence the response of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) in vivo during demyelination and remyelination in the adult brain. We have previously shown that BMP4 infusion increases numbers of OPCs during cuprizone-induced demyelination, while infusion of Noggin, an endogenenous antagonist of BMP4 increases numbers of mature oligodendrocytes and remyelinated axons following recovery. Additional studies have shown that insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) promotes the survival of OPCs during cuprizone-induced demyelination. Based on these data, we investigated whether myelin repair could be further enhanced by sequential infusion of these agents firstly, BMP4 to increase OPC numbers, followed by either Noggin or IGF-1 to increase the differentiation and survival of the newly generated OPCs. We identified that sequential delivery of BMP4 and IGF-1 during cuprizone challenge increased the number of mature oligodendrocytes and decreased astrocyte numbers following recovery compared with vehicle infused mice, but did not alter remyelination. However, sequential delivery of BMP4 and Noggin during cuprizone challenge did not alter numbers of oligodendrocytes or astrocytes in the corpus callosum compared with vehicle infused mice. Furthermore, electron microscopy analysis revealed no change in average myelin thickness in the corpus callosum between vehicle infused and BMP4-Noggin infused mice. Our results suggest that while single delivery of Noggin or IGF-1 increased the production of mature oligodendrocytes in vivo in the context of demyelination, only Noggin infusion promoted remyelination. Thus, sequential delivery of BMP4 and Noggin or IGF-1 does not further enhance myelin repair above what occurs with delivery of Noggin alone. © 2013 Sabo et al.</p>"
892,2-s2.0-84875900854,Corpus callosum damage predicts disability progression and cognitive dysfunction in primary-progressive MS after five years,"<p>We aim to identify specific areas of white matter (WM) and grey matter (GM), which predict disability progression and cognitive dysfunction after five years in patients with primary-progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS). Thirty-two patients with early PPMS were assessed at baseline and after five years on the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), and EDSS step-changes were calculated. At year five, a subgroup of 25 patients and 31 healthy controls underwent a neuropsychological assessment. Baseline imaging consisted of dual-echo (proton density and T2-weighted), T1-weighted volumetric, and diffusion tensor imaging. Fractional anisotropy (FA) maps were created, and fed into tract-based spatial statistics. To compensate for the potential bias introduced by WM lesions, the T1 volumes underwent a lesion-filling procedure before entering a voxel-based morphometry protocol. To investigate whether FA and GM volume predicted EDSS step-changes over five years and neuropsychological tests scores at five years, voxelwise linear regression analyses were performed. Lower FA in the splenium of the corpus callosum (CC) predicted a greater progression of disability over the follow-up. Lower FA along the entire CC predicted worse verbal memory, attention and speed of information processing, and executive function at five years. GM baseline volume did not predict any clinical variable. Our findings highlight the importance of damage to the interhemispheric callosal pathways in determining physical and cognitive disability in PPMS. Disruption of these pathways, which interconnect motor and cognitive networks between the two hemispheres, may result in a disconnection syndrome that contributes to long-term physical and cognitive disability. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p>"

During the latest attack of MS, she suffered from long-lasting paroxysmal dystonia in her left hand. Despite treatment with pulse high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone, interferon, and baclofen, along with occupational therapy, the dystonia persisted and significantly bothered her daily activities. Finally, she was treated with oral acetazolamide (250 mg, three times a day for 4 days), which was very effective for the control of her dystonia.

Objective and methods: Information processing speed in cognitive (Symbol Digit Modalities Test, SDMT), sensory (visual and auditory reaction time) and motor (finger-tapping speed, FT; right and left hand) tasks as well as auditory inter-hemispheric transfer (verbal dichotic listening, VDL) was related to CCA, measured by MRI at baseline and at follow-up after nine years in 22 patients with MS. Possible confounding by demographic (age, gender and education), clinical (symptom onset, duration, severity of disease) and relative brain volume (RBV) as well as T2 lesion load was taken into account. Results: The smaller the CCA at baseline, the slower was SDMT performance at baseline. In a similar way, CCA at follow-up was associated with poor SDMT result at follow-up. Furthermore, the higher the annual rate of change in CCA, the poorer was performance in VDL on the left ear and the more pronounced was the right ear advantage. A positive relationship between performance in VDL right ear and annual rate of change in RBV was also seen. Sensory-motor tests were not significantly associated with CCA. T2 lesion load at baseline was associated with FT performance at baseline. Demographic, clinical and radiological (RBV and T2 lesion load) characteristics did not confound the significant relation between CCA and SDMT. Conclusions: CCA unlike RBV and T2 lesion load was associated with SDMT, which indicated a marked cognitive rather than perceptual-motor component. © 2012 John Wiley &amp; Sons A/S.</p>"
896,2-s2.0-84876233538,"Cognitive impairment in MS: Impact of white matter integrity, gray matter volume, and lesions","<p>Objective: To investigate whether extent and severity of white matter (WM) damage, as measured with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), can distinguish cognitively preserved (CP) from cognitively impaired (CI) multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. Methods: Conventional MRI and DTI data were acquired from 55 MS patients (35 CP, 20 CI) and 30 healthy controls (HC). Voxelwise analyses were used to investigate fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity, radial diffusivity, and axial diffusivity of a WM skeleton. Regional gray matter volume was quantified and lesion probability maps were generated. Results: Compared to HCs, decreased FA was found in 49% of the investigated WM skeleton in CP patients and in 76% of the investigated WM in CI patients. Several brain areas that showed reduced FA in both patient groups were significantly worse in CI patients, i.e, corpus callosum, superior and inferior longitudinal fasciculus, corticospinal tracts, forceps major, cingulum, and fornices. In CI patients, WM integrity damage was additionally seen in cortical brain areas, thalamus, uncinate fasciculus, brainstem, and cerebellum. These findings were independent of lesion location and regional gray matter volume, since no differences were found between the groups. Conclusion: CI patients diverged from CP patients only on DTI metrics. WM integrity changes were found in areas that are highly relevant for cognition in the CI patients but not in the CP patients. These WM changes are therefore thought to be related to the cognitive deficits and suggest that DTI might be a powerful tool when monitoring cognitive impairment in MS. © 2013 American Academy of Neurology.</p>"

Her symptoms included a progressive 11-month history of vertigo, gait ataxia, and right thalamic stroke. A diagnosis of CNS Rosai-Dorfman disease was made following open dural biopsy, and later confirmed on autopsy studies. The autopsy demonstrated widespread dural infiltration by inflammatory cells, principally large histiocytes, many of which exhibited emperipolesis, a characteristic finding in Rosai-Dorfman disease. A second pathological finding on autopsy was the presence of multiple demyelinating plaques (with preservation of axons), located in the corpus callosum, periventricular white matter, and multiple brainstem segments. These were consistent with a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis. This case description serves to remind clinicians that CNS Rosai-Dorfman disease-although uncommon-may present as a focal, dural-based, hemispheric mass lesion, or as diffuse pachymeningeal inflammation. Our case was also unusual due to the co-existence of CNS Rosai-Dorfman disease, multiple sclerosis, and polycythemia vera (all rare diseases) in a single patient. Although the overlap of disorders may have been co-incidental, one could raise the question whether all three disorders were triggered by the same underlying dysimmune state. © 2013 International Society of Neuropathology.</p>"

The therapeutic effect has been shown in animal models of multiple sclerosis, in which the myelin sheath is specifically destroyed in the central nervous system. However, it remains unproven whether estrogen is directly involved in remyelination via the myelin producing cells, oligodendrocytes, or which estrogen receptors are involved. In this study, we found that the membrane-associated estrogen receptor, the G protein-coupled receptor 30 (GPR30), also known as GPER, was expressed in oligodendrocytes in rat spinal cord and corpus callosum. Moreover, GPR30 was expressed throughout oligodendrocyte differentiation and promyelinating stages in primary oligodendrocyte cultures derived from rat spinal cords and brains. To evaluate the role of signaling via GPR30 in promyelination, a specific agonist for GPR30, G1, was administered to a rat model of demyelination induced by cuprizone treatment. Histological examination of the corpus callosum with oligodendrocyte differentiation stage-specific markers showed that G1 enhanced oligodendrocyte maturation in corpus callosum of cuprizone-treated animals. It also enhanced oligodendrocyte ensheathment of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons in co-culture and myelination in cuprizone-treated animals. This study is the first evidence that GPR30 signaling promotes remyelination by oligodendrocytes after demyelination. GPR30 ligands may provide a novel therapy for the treatment of multiple sclerosis. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p>"

ALSP is a rare adult-onset leukodystrophy, which encompasses hereditary diffuse leukoencephalopathy with axonal spheroids and pigmentary orthochromatic leukodystrophy. This was a retrospective chart review and literature review. Five previously healthy women presented with a rapidly progressive neurological disorder at ages 39, 37, 40, 30, and 47, respectively. All five individuals were initially diagnosed as suffering from multiple sclerosis. The clinical courses of the five patients were dominated by progressive spastic quadriparesis (patient 5, newly diagnosed, has paraparesis at this time) and dementia. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed diffuse cerebral atrophy, corpus callosal atrophy, and diffuse T2 hyperintensities in the subcortical and periventricular white matter with no gadolinium enhancing lesions. Three patients showed involvement of pyramidal tracts from motor cortex to the brainstem. Cerebrospinal fluid was normal in all cases. Diagnosis of ALSP was established by biopsy (two cases) and autopsy (two cases). Histopathology showed the presence of neuroaxonal spheroids in all four cases and pigmented glia in three. In the fifth case, diagnosis was established by genetic analysis alone that showed a disease-causing mutation in the colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) gene. Genetic analysis was done in three patients with available DNA, and identified the disease-causing mutation in all three, including a novel mutation F828S. ALSP may be suspected in adults with rapid to subacute progression of neurological disease when (1) MRI shows corpus callosal atrophy on a background of generalized brain atrophy and diffuse white matter disease without postcontrast enhancement, (2) CSF studies are normal, and (3) studies for systemic inflammatory diseases and specific leukodystrophies are normal. Diagnosis may be made without histopathological evidence when a disease-causing mutation is demonstrated in the CSF1R gene. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.</p>"
901,2-s2.0-84878826326,Tract-specific quantitative MRI better correlates with disability than conventional MRI in multiple sclerosis,"<p>Although diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and the magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) have been extensively studied in multiple sclerosis (MS), it is still unclear if they are more effective biomarkers of disability than conventional MRI. MRI scans were performed on 117 participants with MS in addition to 26 healthy volunteers. Mean values were obtained for DTI indices and MTR for supratentorial brain and three white matter tracts of interest. DTI and MTR values were tested for correlations with measures of atrophy and lesion volume and were compared with these more conventional indices for prediction of disability. All DTI and MTR values correlated to an equivalent degree with lesion volume and cerebral volume fraction (CVF). Thalamic volumes correlated with all indices in the optic radiations and with mean and perpendicular diffusivity in the corpus callosum. Nested model regression analysis demonstrated that, compared with CVF, DTI indices in the optic radiations were more strongly correlated with Expanded Disability Status Scale and were also more strongly correlated than both CVF and lesion volume with low-contrast visual acuity. Abnormalities in DTI and MTR are equivalently linked with brain atrophy and inflammatory lesion burden, suggesting that for practical purposes they are markers of multiple aspects of MS pathology. Our findings that some DTI and MTR indices are more strongly linked with disability than conventional MRI measures justifies their potential use as targeted, functional system-specific clinical trial outcomes in MS. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.</p>"
902,2-s2.0-84874511180,"Differential diagnosis of multiple sclerosis, is Moyamoya in?","<p>Background and purpose: The pleomorphic presentation of multiple sclerosis underscores the importance of the differential diagnosis with several other pathologies, namely cerebral vascular disease. Summary of case: A 37-year-old woman without any previous relevant pathology presented 3 years ago with two episodes of motor deficit. The first on the right upper extremity with improvement following rehabilitation and a second with left hemiparesis also with improvement in less than a week. After routine etiological investigation and with a brain MRI suggestive of multiple sclerosis the patient initiated β-interferon remaining symptom free. Present day examination revealed bilateral loss of hand dexterity, decreased paleasthesia on the inferior limbs and hyperactive reflexes on the left with a left Babinski response. MRI of the brain showed multiple bilateral T2 lesions in the periventricular white matter. Significantly, there was no infra-tentorial or corpus callosum involvement. There was also no associated restricted diffusion. CSF analysis was normal. Based on this findings and with positive familiar history for Moyamoya the patient underwent a four-vessel angiogram that demonstrated bilateral ICA occlusion with formation of distal collateral circulation through extra-cranial and posterior circulation, consistent with Moyamoya disease. Conclusion: Moyamoya disease should be considered in multiple sclerosis differential especially with atypical imaging findings on MRI. Also, the improvement experienced with imunomodulatory treatment highlights the need to better understand the pathophysiology of Moyamoya disease. © 2012 Elsevier GmbH.</p>"

In control and MS normal-appearing white matter (NAWM), nuclear VDR immunostaining was observed in oligodendrocyte-like cells, humanleukocyte antigen (HLA)-positive microglia, and glial fibrillary acidic protein-positive astrocytes. There was a 2-fold increase in VDR transcripts in MS NAWM versus control white matter (p = 0.03). In chronic active MS lesions, HLA-positive microglia/macrophages showed nuclear VDR staining; astrocytes showed nuclear and cytoplasmic VDR staining. Staining for 24-OHase was restricted to astrocytes.VDR and CYP27B1 mRNA expressions were increased in active MS lesions versus NAWM (p &lt; 0.01, p = 0.04, respectively). In primary human astrocytes in vitro, the active formof vitamin D, 1,25(OH)2D3, induced upregulation of VDR and CYP24A1. Tumor necrosis factor and interferon-γ upregulated CYP27B1 mRNA in primary human microglia and astrocytes. IncreasedVDR expression in MS NAWM and inflammatory cytokine-induced amplified expression of VDR and CYP27B1 in chronic active MS lesions suggest increased sensitivity to vitamin D in NAWM and a possible endogenous role for vitamin D metabolism in the suppression of active MS lesions. © 2013 by the American Association of Neuropathologists, Inc.</p>"
904,2-s2.0-84872417196,White matter volume is decreased in the brain of patients with neuromyelitis optica,"<p>Background: Neuromyelitis optica (NMO) is an inflammatory disease involving predominantly the spinal cord and optic nerves. Whether patients with NMO have a loss in white or grey matter (GM) volumes remains to be determined. Methods: Thirty patients with NMO, 30 healthy subjects matched for age and gender, 21 patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) and 20 patients with a clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) were studied. We applied a SIENAX post-treatment software. We compared white matter (WM) and GM volumes between groups and explored correlations of changes in NMO patients with age, gender, duration, disease severity, visual acuity and T2 hyperintensities. We also performed a voxel-based morphometry (VBM) analysis to identify the regions affected by loss of volume. Results: White matter volume was significantly reduced in patients with NMO (764.4 ± 58.3 cm<sup>3</sup>) compared to healthy subjects (843.1 ± 49.3 cm<sup>3</sup>) (P &lt; 0.001), whereas no difference was observed for the GM. Patients with CIS also presented an elective atrophy of WM and MS an atrophy of both WM and GM. We did not find any predictive factors of brain atrophy. The decrease in WM volume in NMO was noted even in the absence of visible MRI hypersignals. The VBM analysis found a few regions of WM atrophy (corpus callosum and optic radiations, P &lt; 0.005, uncorrected) and a few regions of GM atrophy (thalamus and prefrontal cortex, P &lt; 0.001, uncorrected). Conclusion: These results suggest a significant brain involvement in NMO, especially an involvement of WM which appears not to be limited to secondary degeneration after spinal cord and optic nerve damage. © 2012 The Author(s) European Journal of Neurology © 2012 EFNS.</p>"

Here, we analyze SD of neural progenitors in 6-8 weeks and 6-8 months normal C57BL/6, SJL/J, and BALB/c mice in the subventricular zone (SVZ), dorsolateral horn (DLC), corpus callosum (CC), and parenchyma. With a short 2-h bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) pulse, no gender and strain differences are present at 6-8 weeks. At 6-8 months, the number of BrdU<sup>+</sup> cells decreases twofold in each sex, strain, and region, indicating that a common aging mechanism regulates BrdU incorporation. Strikingly, 2× more BrdU<sup>+</sup> cells are found in all brain regions in 6-8 months C57BL/6 females versus males, no gender differences in 6-8 months SJL/J, and fewer BrdU<sup>+</sup> cells in females versus males in BALB/cs. The number of BrdU<sup>+</sup> cells modestly fluctuates throughout the estrous cycle in C57BL/6 and SJLs. Castration causes a dramatic increase in BrdU<sup>+</sup> cells in SVZ and DLC. These findings indicate that testosterone is a major regulator of adult neural proliferation. At 6-8 months, the ratio of PDGFRα<sup>+</sup> cells in the CC to BrdU<sup>+</sup> cells in the DLC of both strains, sexes, estrous cycle, and castrated mice was essentially the same, suggesting that BrdU<sup>+</sup> cells in the DLC differentiate into CC oligodendrocytes. The ratio of TUNEL<sup>+</sup> to BrdU<sup>+</sup> cells does not match proliferation, indicating that these events are differentially regulated. Differential regulation of these two processes leads to the variation in glial numbers between gender and strain. Explanations of neural proliferation based upon data from one sex or strain may be very misleading. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p>"
906,2-s2.0-84873042949,The antiaging protein klotho enhances oligodendrocyte maturation and myelination of the CNS,"<p>We have previously shown that myelin abnormalities characterize the normal aging process of the brain and that an age-associated reduction in Klotho is conserved across species. Predominantly generated in brain and kidney, Klotho overexpression extends life span, whereas loss of Klotho accelerates the development of aging-like phenotypes. Although the function of Klotho in brain is unknown, loss of Klotho expression leads to cognitive deficits. We found significant effects of Klotho on oligodendrocyte functions, including induced maturation of rat primary oligodendrocytic progenitor cells (OPCs) in vitro and myelination. Phosphoprotein analysis indicated that Klotho's downstream effects involve Akt and ERK signal pathways. Klotho increased OPC maturation, and inhibition of Akt or ERK function blocked this effect on OPCs. In vivo studies of Klotho knock-out mice and control littermates revealed that knock-out mice have a significant reduction in major myelin protein and gene expression. By immunohistochemistry, the number of total and mature oligodendrocytes was significantly lower in Klotho knock-out mice. Strikingly, at the ultrastructural level, Klotho knock-out mice exhibited significantly impaired myelination of the optic nerve and corpus callosum. These mice also displayed severe abnormalities at the nodes of Ranvier. To decipher the mechanisms by which Klotho affects oligodendrocytes, we used luciferase pathway reporters to identify the transcription factors involved. Together, these studies provide novel evidence for Klotho as a key player in myelin biology, which may thus be a useful therapeutic target in efforts to protect brain myelin against age-dependent changes and promote repair in multiple sclerosis. © 2013 the authors.</p>"
907,2-s2.0-84873681297,Location of brain lesions predicts conversion of clinically isolated syndromes to multiple sclerosis,"<p>Objectives: To assess in a large population of patients with clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) the relevance of brain lesion location and frequency in predicting 1-year conversion to multiple sclerosis (MS). Methods: In thismulticenter, retrospective study, clinical andMRI data at onset and clinical follow-up at 1 year were collected for 1,165 patients with CIS. On T2-weighted MRI, we generated lesion probability maps of white matter (WM) lesion location and frequency. Voxelwise analyses were performed with a nonparametric permutation-based approach (p &lt; 0.05, cluster-corrected). Results: In CIS patients with hemispheric, multifocal, and brainstem/cerebellar onset, lesion probability map clusters were seen in clinically eloquent brain regions. Significant lesion clusters were not found in CIS patients with optic nerve and spinal cord onset. At 1 year, clinically definite MS developed in 26% of patients. The converting group, despite a greater baseline lesion load compared with the nonconverting group (7 ± 8.1 cm<sup>3</sup> vs 4.6 ± 6.7 cm<sup>3</sup>, p &lt; 0.001), showed less widespread lesion distribution (18% vs 25% of brain voxels occupied by lesions). High lesion frequency was found in the converting group in projection, association, and commissural WM tracts, with larger clusters being in the corpus callosum, corona radiata, and cingulum. Conclusions: Higher frequency of lesion occurrence in clinically eloquent WM tracts can characterize CIS subjects with different types of onset. The involvement of specific WM tracts, in particular those traversed by fibers involved in motor function and near the corpus callosum, seems to be associated with a higher risk of clinical conversion to MS in the short term. © 2013 American Academy of Neurology.</p>"

It is often misdiagnosed as acute disseminated encephalomyelitis or multiple sclerosis. We report the case of a 25-year-old male with Susac syndrome who developed the clinical triad of encephalopathy, visual and hearing problems over the course of a year. The characteristic MRI findings including central corpus callosal involvement and brain infarctions were supported by branch retinal arterial/arteriolar occlusions on fluorescein retinal angiography. Most patients with Susac syndrome will not have the complete clinical triad initially. A very high index of suspicion is required by the clinician and radiologist in patients with any component of the clinical triad so as not to misdiagnose the MRI findings for demyelination. Even if initial ophthalmologic examinations are normal, these patients should be followed up for later development of branch retinal artery occlusions.</p>"
910,2-s2.0-84900205132,Multiple sclerosis presenting initially with a worsening of migraine symptoms.,"<p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic autoimmune disease that targets myelinated axons in the central nervous system. Headache has been reported as a subtle symptom of the onset of MS, with a variable frequency of 1.6-28.5%; however, it remains unclear whether headache is a true symptom of MS onset. Here, we report the case of a female patient who had a history of migraine without aura and experienced worsening of migraine-headache symptoms as the initial manifestation of MS. Three similar cases were reported previously; however, unlike this case, those cases had no history of migraine without aura. In our case, we excluded factors that could trigger migraine attacks, such as changes in weather, drugs, alcohol, caffeine withdrawal, stress, fatigue, lack of sleep, hormonal therapy, diet, and hunger. The patient had one episode of MS attack with the simultaneous presence of asymptomatic gadolinium-enhancing and non-enhancing lesions, including hyperintense lesions in the bilateral periventricular white matter, body of the corpus callosum, and periaqueductal grey matter, as observed on the T2-weighted images obtained at the first brain magnetic resonance imaging. In addition, after the injection of gadolinium contrast, ring enhancement over these lesions was noted in T1-weighted images, which was suggestive of active demyelination. MS was diagnosed according to the McDonald criteria (2010 revision). We conclude that MS with periaqueductal grey matter involvement may present with worsening migraine. It is important to be cautious if any secondary causes exist, especially when the patient has a history of migraine without aura. MS should be one of the differential diagnoses in young women showing a change in headache pattern or poor clinical drug response to migraine treatment accompanied by episodes of focal neurological deficit. Failure to recognize MS may lead to inappropriate treatment and worse prognosis; early diagnosis in patients with MS is essential to improve their clinical outcomes and quality of life.</p>"

By making measurements over a range of field strengths and scan parameters, we tested the key assumptions and the robustness of the method. The measurements confirm that a consistent quantitative estimate of MTV can be obtained across a range of scanners. MTV estimates are sufficiently precise to enable a comparison between data obtained from an individual subject with control population data. We describe two applications. First, we show that MTV estimates can be combined with T1 and diffusion measurements to augment our understanding of the tissue properties. Second, we show that MTV provides a sensitive measure of disease status in individual patients with multiple sclerosis. The MTV maps are obtained using short clinically appropriate scans that can reveal how tissue changes influence behavior and cognition. © 2013 Nature America, Inc.</p>"

914,2-s2.0-84880533093,Anatomical brain connectivity can assess cognitive dysfunction in multiple sclerosis,"<p>Background: Brain disconnection plays a major role in determining cognitive disabilities in multiple sclerosis (MS). We recently developed a novel diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) tractography approach, namely anatomical connectivitity mapping (ACM), that quantifies structural brain connectivity. Objective: Use of ACM to assess structural connectivity modifications in MS brains and ascertain their relationship with the patients' Paced-Auditory-Serial-Addition-Test (PASAT) scores. Methods: Relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) patients (n = 25) and controls (n = 25) underwent MRI at 3T, including conventional images, T1-weighted volumes and DW-MRI. Volumetric scans were coregistered to fractional anisotropy (FA) images, to obtain parenchymal FA maps for both white and grey matter. We initiated probabilistic tractography from all parenchymal voxels, obtaining ACM maps by counting the number of streamlines passing through each voxel, then normalizing by the total number of streamlines initiated. The ACM maps were transformed into standard space, for statistical use. Results: RRMS patients had reduced grey matter volume and FA, consistent with previous literature. Also, we showed reduced ACM in the thalamus and in the head of the caudate nucleus, bilaterally. In our RRMS patients, ACM was associated with PASAT scores in the corpus callosum, right hippocampus and cerebellum. Conclusions: ACM opens a new perspective, clarifying the contribution of anatomical brain disconnection to clinical disabilities in MS. © The Author(s) 2013.</p>"

Methods: All subjects were examined using a Siemens Antares duplex ultrasound machine. The internal jugular, vertebral and intracranial veins were studied in subjects in both supine and sitting postures. The sonographer was blind to the subject's clinical status. Measures included the criteria proposed by Zamboni and volume flow. Presence of CCSVI was defined as ≥2 Zamboni criteria. Results: Seventy patient-control pairs were recruited, with 11 males and 59 females in each group. Only one subject, a control, satisfied the Zamboni definition of CCSVI; however, 19 patients and 13 controls had abnormalities as defined by Zamboni, the difference largely caused by a higher prevalence in patients of internal jugular vein (IJV) stenosis, defined as a cross-sectional area ≤0.3cm<sup>2</sup>. This difference disappeared with a more rigorous stenosis definition. Further analysis revealed there was IJV valve variation in seven patients and one control. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that CCSVI, as defined by the Zamboni ultrasound criteria, is not present in CIS and mild RRMS (EDSS ≤2), providing further evidence that CCSVI does not have a causal role in MS; however, we found an apparent increase in IJV variation in patients with CIS or mild MS that would warrant further investigation. © The Author(s) 2012.</p>"

917,2-s2.0-84873333551,Targeting ASIC1 in primary progressive multiple sclerosis: Evidence of neuroprotection with amiloride,"<p>Neurodegeneration is the main cause for permanent disability in multiple sclerosis. The effect of current immunomodulatory treatments on neurodegeneration is insufficient. Therefore, direct neuroprotection and myeloprotection remain an important therapeutic goal. Targeting acid-sensing ion channel 1 (encoded by the ASIC1 gene), which contributes to the excessive intracellular accumulation of injurious Na<sup>+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> and is over-expressed in acute multiple sclerosis lesions, appears to be a viable strategy to limit cellular injury that is the substrate of neurodegeneration. While blockade of ASIC1 through amiloride, a potassium sparing diuretic that is currently licensed for hypertension and congestive cardiac failure, showed neuroprotective and myeloprotective effects in experimental models of multiple sclerosis, this strategy remains untested in patients with multiple sclerosis. In this translational study, we tested the neuroprotective effects of amiloride in patients with primary progressive multiple sclerosis. First, we assessed ASIC1 expression in chronic brain lesions from post-mortem of patients with progressive multiple sclerosis to identify the target process for neuroprotection. Second, we tested the neuroprotective effect of amiloride in a cohort of 14 patients with primary progressive multiple sclerosis using magnetic resonance imaging markers of neurodegeneration as outcome measures of neuroprotection. Patients with primary progressive multiple sclerosis underwent serial magnetic resonance imaging scans before (pretreatment phase) and during (treatment phase) amiloride treatment for a period of 3 years. Whole-brain volume and tissue integrity were measured with high-resolution T <inf>1</inf>-weighted and diffusion tensor imaging. In chronic brain lesions of patients with progressive multiple sclerosis, we demonstrate an increased expression of ASIC1 in axons and an association with injury markers within chronic inactive lesions. In patients with primary progressive multiple sclerosis, we observed a significant reduction in normalized annual rate of whole-brain volume during the treatment phase, compared with the pretreatment phase (P = 0.018, corrected). Consistent with this reduction, we showed that changes in diffusion indices of tissue damage within major clinically relevant white matter (corpus callosum and corticospinal tract) and deep grey matter (thalamus) structures were significantly reduced during the treatment phase (P = 0.02, corrected). Our results extend evidence of the contribution of ASIC1 to neurodegeneration in multiple sclerosis and suggest that amiloride may exert neuroprotective effects in patients with progressive multiple sclerosis. This pilot study is the first translational study on neuroprotection targeting ASIC1 and supports future randomized controlled trials measuring neuroprotection with amiloride in patients with multiple sclerosis. © (2012) The Author.</p>"
918,2-s2.0-84872004163,Regional heterogeneity of cuprizone-induced demyelination: Topographical aspects of the midline of the corpus callosum,"<p>The cuprizone model is a suitable animal model of de- and remyelination secondary to toxin-induced oligodendrogliopathy. From a pharmaceutical point of view, the cuprizone model is a valuable tool to study the potency of compounds which interfere with toxin-induced oligodendrocyte cell death or boost/inhibit remyelinating pathways and processes. The aim of this study was to analyze the vulnerability of neighboring white mater tracts (i.e., the fornix and cingulum) next to the midline of the corpus callosum which is the region of interest of most studies using this model. Male mice were fed cuprizone for various time periods. Different white matter areas were analyzed for myelin (anti-PLP), microglia (anti-IBA1), and astrocyte (anti-GFAP) responses by means of immunohistochemistry. Furthermore, Luxol fast blue-periodic acid Schiff stains were performed to validate loss of myelin-reactive fibers in the different regions. Cuprizone induced profound demyelination of the midline of the corpus callosum and medial parts of the cingulum that was paralleled by a significant astrocyte and microglia response. In contrast, lateral parts of the corpus callosum and the cingulum, as well as the fornix region which is just beneath the midline of the corpus callosum appeared to be resistant to cuprizone exposure. Furthermore, resistant areas displayed reduced astrogliosis and microgliosis. This study clearly demonstrates that neighboring white matter tracts display distinct vulnerability to toxin-induced demyelination. This important finding has direct relevance for evaluation strategies in this frequently used animal model for multiple sclerosis. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media New York.</p>"

Objective: To clarify MRI abnormalities in callosal lesions of NMO. Methods: Japanese patients with NMO (n=28) or MS (n=22) were assessed. The distributions and appearances of callosal lesions were evaluated on a brain mid-sagittal T2-weighted image (T2WI) or a fluid-attenuated inversion recovery image with a 1.5T MRI scanner. Logistic regression analysis identified which characteristics of the callosal lesions were useful for discriminating NMO from MS. Results: Callosal lesions were present in 79% of NMO and 82% of MS patients. Callosal abnormalities of NMO, including splenial lesions (57% in NMO versus 27% in MS, odds ratio (OR)=4.23, p=0.04), diffusely spreading lesions from the lower to upper edges of the corpus callosum (71% versus 23%, OR=7.18, p=0.0024), and heterogeneous T2 hyperintense lesions (71% versus 9%, OR=44.3, p=0.0006), were feasible for discriminating NMO from MS.

922,2-s2.0-84892780233,MR diffusion tensor imaging in multiple sclerosis: A regional and statistical analysis of microstructural alterations,"<p>Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) became the first radiological examination that is essential to the diagnosis of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), and most informative for the understanding of the illness and the patient care. If conventional MRI shows the lesion load reflecting mainly the inflammatory aspect of the disease, the lack of clinico-radiological correlation has led to the research of new markers for monitoring and predicting the progression of the disease to better adapt the medical treatment to each patient. Therefore, quantitative MR methods have been developed to better access these alterations that were undetectable by conventional MRI such as diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). DTI is a very promising technique for fiber tracking the cerebral white matter (WM) as well as to provide accurate quantification of biophysic markers reflecting microstructure alterations of axonal/neuronal integrity and connectivity. This information can be obtained through the measurement of several parameters such as the fractional anisotropy (FA), the mean diffusivity (MD) and the axial and radial diffusivities (λa and λr) by selecting regions of interest (ROI) in lesions, normal appearing WM or structures such as the corpus callosum. More recently, the ability to analyze DTI data in a voxelwise approach using statistic techniques such ""Tract-Based Spatial Statistics"" (TBSS) allowed us to localize alterations in an observer-independent manner in the whole WM of patients with different clinical forms.Therefore, to investigate the role of DTI for better characterizing the pathological processes in different clinical forms of MS, we performed a study on 69 patients with Relapsing Remitting (RR), primary (PP) and secondary progressive (SP) and 29 control subjects. The quantification of DTI metrics demonstrated significant increases of MD, λa, and λr, and a decrease of FA in MS patients of any clinical form compared to control subjects. Moreover, these alterations were significantly greater in progressive forms such SP and PP compared to RR. Compared to FA and λa, the radial diffusivity showed the best sensitivity to detect alterations. This result may suggest a better specificity of this marker to the demyelinating and inflammatory processes. As shown by both ROI and TBSS approaches, the corpus callosum appeared the most and earliest damaged structure in RR patients, probably due to inflammatory attacks as confirmed by the good correlation obtained between DTI values and the lesion load. Therefore, DTI metrics constitute an early and sensitive marker to follow-up the white matter alterations and better understand the disease progression. © 2012 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

923,2-s2.0-84878344856,Astrocyte TNFR2 is required for CXCL12-mediated regulation of oligodendrocyte progenitor proliferation and differentiation within the adult CNS,"<p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is characterized by episodes of inflammatory demyelination with progressive failure of remyelination. Prior studies using murine models of MS indicate that remyelination within the adult central nervous system (CNS) requires the expression and activity of TNFR2 and CXCR4 by oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs), promoting their proliferation and differentiation into mature oligodendrocytes. Here, we extend these studies by examining the role of TNFR2 in the expression of the CXCR4 ligand, CXCL12, within the corpus callosum (CC) during cuprizone (CPZ) intoxication and by demonstrating that lentiviral-mediated gene delivery of CXCL12 to the demyelinated CC improves OPC proliferation and myelin expression during remyelination. Activated astrocytes and microglia express both TNFR1 and TNFR2 within the demyelinated CC. However, CPZ intoxicated TNFR2-/- mice exhibit loss of up-regulation of CXCL12 in astrocytes with concomitant decreases in numbers of CXCR4+ NG2+ OPCs within the CC. While CXCR4 antagonism does not affect OPC migration from subventricular zones into the CC, it decreases their proliferation and differentiation within the CC. Stereotactic delivery of lentivirus expressing CXCL12 protein into the CC of acutely demyelinated TNFR2-/- mice increases OPC proliferation and expression of myelin. In contrast, chronically demyelinated wild-type mice, which exhibit significant loss of astrocytes and OPCs, are unable to be rescued via CXCL12 lentivirus alone but instead required engraftment of CXCL12-expressing astrocytes for increased myelin expression. Our results show that TNFR2 activation induces CXCL12 expression in the demyelinated CC via autocrine signaling specifically within astrocytes, which promotes OPC proliferation and differentiation. In addition, gene delivery of critical pro-myelinating proteins might be a feasible approach for the treatment of remyelination failure in MS. © 2012 The Author(s).</p>"

The aim of this study was to examine the effects of co-administration of 17β-estradiol (E2) and adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADSCs) on remyelination of corpus callosum axons in a cuprizone model of MS. Forty eight male C57BL/6 mice were fed cuprizone (0.2%) for 6 weeks. At day 0 after cuprizone removal, animals were randomly divided into four groups. The E2 monotherapy, ADSCs monotherapy, E2/ADSCs combined therapy and vehicle control. Some mice of the same age were fed with their normal diet to serve as healthy control group. E2 pellets, designed to release 5.0 mg E2 over 10 days, were implanted subcutaneously. 10<sup>6</sup> PKH26 labeled ADSCs were transplanted into lateral tail. The extent of demyelination, remyelination, and cell type's composition of host brain were examined at 10 days post-transplantation in the body of the corpus callosum. Transplanted cells migrated to the corpus callosum injury. Histological examination revealed efficacy of intravenous ADSCs transplantation in remyelination of mouse cuprizone model of MS can be significantly enhanced by E2 administration. Flow cytometry showed that the mean percentages of expression of Iba-1, Olig2 and O4 were significantly increased in E2/ADSCs combined therapy in comparison with ADSCs monotherapy. In conclusion, the findings of this study revealed that E2 administration enhanced efficacy of intravenous ADSCs transplantation in remyelination of corpus callosum axons in mouse cuprizone model of MS. © 2012 Tehran University of Medical Sciences.</p>"
925,2-s2.0-84870678162,Diffusion tensor imaging of normal-appearing white matter in neuromyelitis optica,"<p>Objectives: Neuromyelitis optica (NMO) is an inflammatory disease of the central nervous system characterized by severe attacks of optic neuritis and myelitis. Brain was classically, unlike in multiple sclerosis (MS), spared. Nevertheless recent studies showed that brain lesions can be seen with MRI. We studied the diffusion characteristics of normal-appearing white matter (NAWM) and abnormal white matter in NMO patients compared with NAWM in healthy subjects. Patients and methods: Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) scans of the brain and spinal cord were obtained from 25 patients with NMO and 20 age- and gender-matched healthy subjects. Region of interest (ROI) analysis of the apparent diffusivity coefficient (ADC) and fractional anisotropy (FA) was performed in brain NAWM (optic radiations, corpus callosum [CC] and anterior and posterior limbs of the internal capsule [IC]) and in spinal cord NAWM and in lesions. Results: ADC was increased and FA decreased in NMO patients in the posterior limb of the IC in the optic radiations and in spinal cord NAWM. FA was lower in spinal cord lesions. In contrast, there was no difference between the two groups in the anterior limb of the IC nor in the CC. Conclusion: These results suggest that DTI abnormalities are very severe in NMO spinal cord lesions. In our study, DTI abnormalities in NAWM were restricted to optic radiations and cortico-spinal tracts, suggesting secondary Wallerian degeneration. In contrast, NAWM outside these tracts (CC and anterior IC) remained normal suggesting that, unlike what is observed in MS, there is no infra-lesional abnormality in NMO. © 2011 Elsevier Masson SAS.</p>"

927,2-s2.0-84867648886,Sex-related differences of cAMP-specific PDE4B3 mRNA in oligodendrocytes following systemic inflammation,"<p>Sex-related differences have been observed in the incidence and severity of several neurological diseases and in sepsis in humans. Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) has been shown to play an important role in modulating the inflammatory environment during neuroinflammation and importantly in protecting myelin from excitotoxic cell death. Considering the sexual dimorphism in the functional properties of oligodendrocytes and the importance of a systemic inflammation in the progression of multiple sclerosis, we focused on identifying possible sex-related differences in the alterations previously reported for the two phosphodiesterase4B (PDE4B) splice-variants (PDE4B2 and PDE4B3) mRNA expression during innate neuroinflammation. PDE4A, PDE4B, and PDE4D are present in oligodendrocytes and we have previously reported that PDE4B3 mRNA is readily expressed in both oligodendrocytes and neurons. In this study, we analyzed the influence of an intraperitoneal lipopolysaccharide injection on the distribution pattern and expression levels of the PDE4B mRNA splicing variants in both male and female mice brains. Clear differences were observed in PDE4B2 and PDE4B3 mRNA expression levels in males compared with females in a time-dependent manner. Furthermore, we observed that the clear downregulation of PDE4B3 mRNA was reflected in a lower percentage of oligodendrocytes positive for this transcript which correlated with a decrease in inducible cAMP early repressor expression in female corpus callosum. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p>"
928,2-s2.0-84869209204,Volumetric MRI Markers and Predictors of Disease Activity in Early Multiple Sclerosis: A Longitudinal Cohort Study,"<p>Objectives: To compare clinical and MRI parameters between patients with clinically isolated syndrome and those converting to clinically definite multiple sclerosis within 2 years, to identify volumetric MRI predictors of this conversion and to assess effect of early relapses. Methods: The SET study comprised 220 patients with clinically isolated syndrome treated with interferon beta (mean age, 29 years; Expanded Disability Status Scale, 1.5). Three patients with missing data were excluded from the analysis. Physical disability, time to clinically definite multiple sclerosis and volumetric MRI data were recorded for 2 years. Results: Patients reaching clinically definite multiple sclerosis showed impaired recovery of neurological function, faster decrease in corpus callosum cross-sectional area, higher T2 lesion volume and more contrast-enhancing lesions. Six-month decrease in corpus callosum cross-sectional area (≥1%) and baseline T2 lesion volume (≥5 cm<sup>3</sup>) predicted clinically definite multiple sclerosis within 2 years (hazard ratios 2.5 and 1.8, respectively). Of 22 patients fulfilling both predictive criteria, 83% reached clinically definite multiple sclerosis (hazard ratio 6.5). More relapses were associated with poorer recovery of neurological function and accelerated brain atrophy. Conclusions: Neurological impairment is more permanent, brain atrophy is accelerated and focal inflammatory activity is greater in patients converting to clinically definite multiple sclerosis. Six-month corpus callosum atrophy and baseline T2 lesion volume jointly help predict individual risk of clinically definite multiple sclerosis. Early relapses contribute to permanent damage of the central nervous system. © 2012 Kalincik et al.</p>"
929,2-s2.0-84868652188,Measurement of corpus callosum and comparison of MRI techniques for monitoring of multiple sclerosis,"<p>Aim: To compare contemporary MRI measures for prediction of future clinical disability in multiple sclerosis patients (MS) by analysis of our MRI data (brain atrophy, T2 lesion volume, T1 lesion volume and corpus callosum atrophy). Methods: Long-term (seven years) longitudinal MRI data of 178 patients were analyzed in the same protocol: FLAIR and T1WI 3D. Using an originally developed software named ScanViewCZ (developed at our MR unit), lesion load was measured automatically from FLAIR sequence (T2 lesion volume), the brain atrophy, brain parenchymal fraction and T1 lesion volume were assed from T1W 3D sequence. Measurement of corpus callosum atrophy: area of the central slice in sagittal reconstruction of T1 W 3D was determined automatically by the originally developed software. Clinical disability was assessed with Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS). Patients were divided into two groups: clinically stable and those with sustained progression over seven years. Results: Statistically significant correlation of future sustained disability progression (as characterized by EDSS score) was found in association with brain atrophy and corpus callosum atrophy. Correlation with lesion load was low. Using the corpus callosum MRI, clinically stable patients were statistically significantly (p = 0.0024) different from patients with sustained progression as soon as within the first year. Conclusions: This retrospective study shows that monitoring of the corpus callosum atrophy is the most useful for stratification of patients into ""stable"" and ""sustained progression"" groups.</p>"
930,2-s2.0-84867572022,A brief review of Susac syndrome,"<p>Susac syndrome was named after J.O. Susac who first described the syndrome in 1979. It is characterized by the clinical triad of encephalopathy, branch retinal artery occlusion, and sensorineural hearing loss. It mainly occurs in young women. This underdiagnosed disease needs to be considered in the differential diagnosis of a broad variety of disorders. In Susac syndrome, autoimmune processes leading to damage and inflammation-related occlusion of the microvessels in brain, retina, and inner ear are thought to play a causal role. The diagnosis is based primarily on the clinical presentation, the documentation of branch retinal artery occlusion by fluorescence angiography, and characteristic findings on cerebral MRI, that help in distinguishing Susac syndrome from other inflammatory entities, like multiple sclerosis. Antiendothelial cell antibodies could be detected in some patients. Patients are successfully treated with immunosuppression, however, the best regimen still needs to be defined. As a result of the rarity of the disease, controlled therapeutic trials are missing so far. In this review, we want to demonstrate the clinical features, natural history, treatment, and clinical course of Susac syndrome, illustrated by a typical case history. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.</p>"
931,2-s2.0-84868379212,Relevance of Brain Lesion Location to Cognition in Relapsing Multiple Sclerosis,"<p>Objective: To assess the relationship between cognition and brain white matter (WM) lesion distribution and frequency in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RR MS). Methods: MRI-based T2 lesion probability map (LPM) was used to assess the relevance of brain lesion location for cognitive impairment in a group of 142 consecutive patients with RRMS. Significance of voxelwise analyses was p&lt;0.05, cluster-corrected for multiple comparisons. The Rao Brief Repeatable Battery was administered at the time of brain MRI to categorize the MS population into cognitively preserved (CP) and cognitively impaired (CI). Results: Out of 142 RRMS, 106 were classified as CP and 36 as CI. Although the CI group had greater WM lesion volume than the CP group (p = 0.001), T2 lesions tended to be less widespread across the WM. The peak of lesion frequency was almost twice higher in CI (61% in the forceps major) than in CP patients (37% in the posterior corona radiata). The voxelwise analysis confirmed that lesion frequency was higher in CI than in CP patients with significant bilateral clusters in the forceps major and in the splenium of the corpus callosum (p&lt;0.05, corrected). Low scores of the Symbol Digit Modalities Test correlated with higher lesion frequency in these WM regions. Conclusions: Overall these results suggest that in MS patients, areas relevant for cognition lie mostly in the commissural fiber tracts. This supports the notion of a functional (multiple) disconnection between grey matter structures, secondary to damage located in specific WM areas, as one of the most important mechanisms leading to cognitive impairment in MS. © 2012 Rossi et al.</p>"
932,2-s2.0-84870741573,Comparison study of imaging features of multiple sclerosis and neuromyelitis optica,"<p>Objective: To compare the imaging characteristics of multiple sclerosis (MS) and neuromyelitis optica (NMO) for better diagnosis and differential diagnosis. Methods: The brain and spinal MRI images of 60 MS and 48 NMO cases were retrospectively reviewed. The imaging characteristics including the predilection site, morphological features, enhancement manifestations were summarized. All data was analyzed by using t test and Chi square test with SPSS 13.0. Results: (1) The three top predilection sites of brain in head MRI of MS patients were periventricular white matter (34 cases in 60), subcortical white matter (27 cases in 60), brain stem (23 cases in 60). MS lesions also were found in basal ganglia, cerebellum, corpus callosum and thalamus, as well as cortex (9 cases in 60). By contrast, brain lesions were observed in 59.4% (19/32) of NMO patients, and the three top predilection sites of NMO by turns were brain stem (13 cases in 19), periventricular white matter (12 cases in 19), subcortical white matter (7 cases in 19). Furthermore, the lesions surrounding third ventricle (6 cases in 19) and the tegmentum of brain stem near peri-aqueduct (8 cases in 19) in NMO were not found in patients of MS. The involvement of brain stem and thalamus was more frequent in NMO than in MS (χ<sup>2</sup>=5.267, 6. 004, P&lt;0.05, respectively). (2) The lesions of spinal cord in MS patients were typically oval, peripheral, and asymmetric, but in NMO patients they were longitudinally extensive and centrally located. The mean number of involved vertebral segments in NMO patients was significantly more than that in MS patients (7.3 vs 2.2, t=-9.288, P&lt;0.01). Furthermore, the number of spinal cord lesions in MS patients was remarkably more than that in NMO (2.0 vs 1.3, t=4. 565, P&lt;0.01). The ratios of occurrence of spinal cord swelling and distension of NMO patients was 58.3% (28/48), which was significantly higher than 21.9% in MS (7/32, χ<sup>2</sup>=10.370, P&lt;0.01). (3) The enhancement pattern in MS was circular (7 cases in 42), oval (6 cases in 42) and irregular (4 cases in 42), while in NMO was mainly sheet-shaped with mild enhancement (5/11). The lesions of spinal cord showed in MS mainly manifested as oval enhancement (16 cases in 26) and linear enhancement (8 cases in 26), while in NMO lesions manifested as strand or mild linear enhancement (26 cases in 35). Conclusions: NMO has several distinct imaging characteristics, which are helpful for differentiation from MS.</p>"
933,2-s2.0-84868109196,"Metallic gold slows disease progression, reduces cell death and induces astrogliosis while simultaneously increasing stem cell responses in an EAE rat model of multiple sclerosis","<p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common neurodegenerative disease in the Western world affecting younger, otherwise healthy individuals. Today no curative treatment exists. Patients suffer from recurring attacks caused by demyelination and underlying neuroinflammation, ultimately leading to loss of neurons. Recent research shows that bio-liberation of gold ions from metallic gold implants can ameliorate inflammation, reduce apoptosis and promote proliferation of neuronal stem cells (NSCs) in a mouse model of focal brain injury. Based on these findings, the present study investigates whether metallic gold implants affect the clinical signs of disease progression and the pathological findings in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a rodent model of MS. Gold particles 20-45 lm suspended in hyaluronic acid were bilaterally injected into the lateral ventricles (LV) of young Lewis rats prior to EAE induction. Comparing gold-treated animals to untreated and vehicle-treated ones, a statistically significant slowing of disease progression in terms of reduced weight loss was seen. Despite massive inflammatory infiltration, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling staining revealed reduced apoptotic cell death in disease foci in the brain stem of gold-treated animals, alongside an up-regulation of glial fibrillary acidic protein-positive reactive astrocytes near the LV and in the brain stem. Cell counting of frizzled-9 and nestin-stained cells showed statistically significant up-regulation of NSCs migrating from the subventricular zone. Additionally, the neuroprotective proteins Metallothionein- 1 and -2 were up-regulated in the corpus callosum. In conclusion, this study is the first to show that the presence of small gold implants affect disease progression in a rat model of MS, increasing the neurogenic response and reducing the loss of cells in disease foci. Gold implants might thus improve clinical outcome for MS patients and further research into the long-term effects of such localized gold treatment is warranted. © Springer-Verlag 2012.</p>"

Inhibitor of DNA binding 2 (Id2) is a transcription factor thought to inhibit oligodendrocyte differentiation, however, it is not known whether the developmental changes and subcellular localization of Id2 are related to myelination. Therefore, we investigated the developmental changes in and the subcellular localization of Id2 immunoreactivity in the rat . Corpus callosum, at post-natal developmental stages P0, P7, P14, P21, P42 and P90, by immunohistochemistry. Id2 expression increased from P0 to a peak at P42, the late stage of myelination in the . Corpus callosum. Id2 immunostaining decreased slightly, but still remained high at P90. Subcellular localization of Id2 changed from presence in cytoplasm at P14 to the nuclei at P42. Moreover, Id2 was mainly co-localized with CC-1-immunopositive mature oligodendrocytes at P42. These results may be consistent with Id2 inhibitory function in oligodendrocyte differentiation, at the end of myelination or in compaction of myelin in the .

We compared the performance of an individual-based method for corpus callosum (CC) fiber tracking in MS with those of two atlas-based methods. Methods: Brain DT MRI scans were acquired from 35 patients with MS and 18 age-matched healthy volunteers (HV). DT-derived metrics from the CC-the mean diffusivity (MD) and fractional anisotropy (FA)-were calculated using an individual-based and two atlas-based methods with different types of subject registration (linear and nonlinear) to a CC atlas. Customized termination criteria were applied to stop the tracking algorithm when using the individual-based method. Results: All the methods were able to distinguish between MS patients and HV. Using the individual-based method, stronger relationships were found between CC DT-derived metrics and the subjects' clinical condition. Conclusion: CC DT tractography using an individual-based method is more sensitive than the atlas-based ones to tract-specific alterations related to MS disability. An atlas-based method with nonlinear registration can be a valid alternative when an automated postprocessing is warranted, such as in the case of high volumes of data. © 2011 by the American Society of Neuroimaging.</p>"
936,2-s2.0-84865339274,Myelin debris regulates inflammatory responses in an experimental demyelination animal model and multiple sclerosis lesions,"<p>In multiple sclerosis (MS), gray matter pathology is characterized by less pronounced inflammation when compared with white matter lesions. Although regional differences in the cytoarchitecture may account for these differences, the amount of myelin debris in the cortex during a demyelinating event might also be contributory. To analyze the association between myelin debris levels and inflammatory responses, cortical areas with distinct and sparse myelination were analyzed for micro- and astrogliosis before and after cuprizone-induced demyelination in mice. In postmortem tissue of MS patients, leucocortical lesions were assessed for the type and level of inflammation in the cortical and white matter regions of the lesion. Furthermore, mice were injected intracerebrally with myelin-enriched debris, and the inflammatory response analyzed in white and grey matter areas. Our studies show that the magnitude of myelin loss positively correlates with microgliosis in the cuprizone model. In MS, the number of MHC class II expressing cells is higher in the white compared with the grey matter part of leucocortical lesions. Finally, direct application of myelin debris into the corpus callosum or cortex of mice induces profound and comparable inflammation in both regions. Our data suggest that myelin debris is an important variable in the inflammatory response during demyelinating events. Whether myelin-driven inflammation affects neuronal integrity remains to be clarified. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p>"

Case Report: A 34-year-old male presented with a history of left-sided tinnitus and sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL). Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain revealed &gt;9, nonenhancing periventricular and corpus callosum lesions. Brainstem auditory evoked potentials were abnormal, ipsilateral to the affected ear, consistent with the presumed underlying demyelinating pathology. Visual evoked potentials showed bilateral prolonged P100 latencies. Oligoclonal bands were not detected in the cerebrospinal fluid, but IgG index was marginally elevated. After administration of corticosteroids, the patient recovered auditory function over a several month period. Conclusions: This report describes a case of SSNHL in the context of magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and electrophysiological findings consistent with a demyelinating etiology. SSNHL is a rare and possibly underrecognized manifestation of clinically isolated syndrome. Copyright © 2012 by Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins.</p>"
939,2-s2.0-84865133907,Electromagnetic field stimulation potentiates endogenous myelin repair by recruiting subventricular neural stem cells in an experimental model of white matter demyelination,"<p>Electromagnetic fields (EMFs) may affect the endogenous neural stem cells within the brain. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of EMFs on the process of toxin-induced demyelination and subsequent remyelination. Demyelination was induced using local injection of lysophosphatidylcholine within the corpus callosum of adult female Sprague-Dawley rats. EMFs (60 Hz; 0.7 mT) were applied for 2 h twice a day for 7, 14, or 28 days postlesion. BrdU labeling and immunostaining against nestin, myelin basic protein (MBP), and BrdU were used for assessing the amount of neural stem cells within the tissue, remyelination patterns, and tracing of proliferating cells, respectively. EMFs significantly reduced the extent of demyelinated area and increased the level of MBP staining within the lesion area on days 14 and 28 postlesion. EMFs also increased the number of BrdU- and nestin-positive cells within the area between SVZ and lesion as observed on days 7 and 14 postlesion. It seems that EMF potentiates proliferation and migration of neural stem cells and enhances the repair of myelin in the context of demyelinating conditions. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.</p>"
940,2-s2.0-84865111743,Inflammatory response and chemokine expression in the white matter corpus callosum and gray matter cortex region during cuprizone-induced demyelination,"<p>Brain inflammation plays a central role in multiple sclerosis (MS). Besides lymphocytes, the astroglia and microglia mainly contribute to the cellular composition of the inflammatory infiltrate in MS lesions. Several studies were able to demonstrate that cortical lesions are characterized by lower levels of inflammatory cells among activated microglia/macrophages. The underlying mechanisms for this difference, however, remain to be clarified. In the current study, we compared the kinetics and extent of microglia and astrocyte activation during early and late cuprizone-induced demyelination in the white matter tract corpus callosum and the telencephalic gray matter. Cellular parameters were related to the expression profiles of the chemokines Ccl2 and Ccl3. We are clearly able to demonstrate that both regions are characterized by early oligodendrocyte stress/apoptosis with concomitant microglia activation and delayed astrocytosis. The extent of microgliosis/astrocytosis appeared to be greater in the subcortical white matter tract corpus callosum compared to the gray matter cortex region. The same holds true for the expression of the key chemokines Ccl2 and Ccl3. The current study defines a model to study early microglia activation and to investigate differences in the neuroinflammatory response of white vs. gray matter. © 2012 The Author(s).</p>"

Cavitary white matter changes may be seen in megalencephalic leukoencephalopathy with subcortical cysts, Alexander disease, mitochondrial leukoencephalopathies, vanishing white matter disease, leukoencephalopathy with calcifications and cysts, cytomegalovirus infection, and cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy. Objective: To analyze clinical and radiological characteristics in MS patients with large cavitary lesions. Methods: We studied MS patients with large cavitary brain lesions. Patient characteristics, disease onset/duration/subtype, expanded disability status scale (EDSS), Mini Mental State (MMS), corpus callosum lesions, history of segmental myelitis, CSF oligoclonal bands (OCB), visual evoked potentials (VEP), vanishing white matter disease genetic analysis, and characteristics of the cavitary lesions were analyzed. Results: Nine patients were analyzed, 1 man and 8 women. Mean age of disease onset was 38.5 years. Mean disease duration was 9 years. Three patients had initial relapsing-remitting MS and 6 patients had primary-progressive MS. Mean EDSS was 4.5. Mean MMS was 20/30. Segmental myelitis was present in 6 cases. OCB were found in 6 patients. VEP was performed in 6 patients, and pathological in all but one. Vanishing white matter disease genetic analysis was performed and negative in 5 patients. Inferior corpus callosum lesions were seen in all patients with available sagittal FLAIR sequences. Cavitary lesions were strictly supratentorial, and located inside the diffuse leukoencephalopathy, with often a posterior predominance.

942,2-s2.0-84862760061,MRI mean diffusivity detects widespread brain degeneration in multiple sclerosis,"<p>We investigated the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings of 32 multiple sclerosis (MS) patients using voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and voxel-based analysis of white matter fluid-attenuated inversion recovery image (FLAIR) high-intensity lesions and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Compared with 18 healthy controls, MS patients showed gray matter volume reduction in the thalamus, hypothalamus, caudate, limbic lobe, and frontal lobe. A marked volume reduction of white matter was evident along the ventriculus lateralis and corpus callosum. FLAIR high-intensity lesions were observed beside the ventriculus lateralis. DTI revealed reduced fractional anisotropy areas similar to those of the FLAIR high-intensity lesions. Changes in the volume of increased mean diffusivity (MD) were the most widespread and extended to normal-appearing white matter (p &lt; 0.001). Multiple regression analysis revealed that MD values were significantly correlated with both disease duration (r = 0.381, p = 0.032) and expanded disability status scale scores (EDSS) (r = 0.393, p = 0.026). This study demonstrated that combined voxel-based analysis for volumetry, FLAIR high-intensity lesions, and DTI could reveal widespread brain abnormalities in MS patients. Furthermore, DTI, especially MD, showed far more widespread brain degeneration than other MRI parameters, and was significantly correlated with both severity and disease duration. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Subjects with MS displayed increased white matter lesions, prolonged water proton longitudinal relaxation time constants in normal appearing white matter, reduced gray matter volumes, and reduced corpus callosum areas compared with controls. No group differences were found for any of the DDT performance measures. In subjects with MS, corpus callosum area was strongly correlated with DDT performance.

The aim of this study was to characterize histopathological changes associated with de/remyelination in grey and white matter at different disease stages in C57Bl/6 mice after per oral administration of cuprizone. Oligodendrocyte loss, astrocytosis and complement activation was detected in areas of demyelination. Demyelination, astrocytosis and complement activation occurred earlier in the cerebral cortex than in the corpus callosum. There was no perivascular lymphocyte infiltration. Microglia- and macrophage activation was observed in the corpus callosum, but not in the cerebral cortex. After cuprizone exposure was stopped, remyelination was extensive in the corpus callosum, but scarce in the cortex. In conclusion, cortical demyelination and oligodendrocyte loss in the cuprizone model may be due to a direct effect on oligodendrocyte mitochondrial function, as it occurs in the absence of microglial activation. The histopathology of de/remyelination in the cuprizone treated mice show regional heterogeneities which suggest differences in the underlying pathophysiology.

945,2-s2.0-84865529170,Selective ultrastructural vulnerability in the cuprizone-induced experimental demyelination,"<p>Background and purpose - It has been reported that multiple sclerosis has four different neuropathological subtypes, and two of them (type III and IV) are characterized by primary oligodendrocyte loss. However, the exact pathomechanism that lead to oligodendrocyte apoptosis in human demyelinating diseases is still elusive. The copper chelator cuprizone induces primary oligodendrocyte apoptosis and consequent demyelination in well defined areas of the mouse brain. Nevertheless, the precise subcellular events that result in oligodendrocyte cell death in the cuprizone model are still unknown. We aimed to study the ultrastructural alterations that might induce oligodendrocyte apoptosis in the cuprizone experimental demyelination model. Methods - C57BL/6 mice were given cuprizone for two, 21 and 35 days to induce demyelination to investigate early pathological events, and different stages of demyelination. In addition, mice were given cuprizone for 35 days and were allowed to recover for two or 14 days to study early and late remyelination. After the cuprizone treatment, mice were sacrificed and the corpus callosum, the superior cerebellar peduncle, the optic nerve and the sciatic nerve were studied by electron microscopy. Results - The ultrastructural analysis revealed that cuprizone induced oligodendrocyte apoptosis is accompanied by the formation of giant mitochondria in the affected cells in the corpus callosum and in the superior cerebellar peduncle. Apoptosis of the myelin producing cells was present through the whole cuprizone challenge. Severe demyelination occurred after three weeks of cuprizone administration associated with massive macrophage infiltration and astrocytosis of the demyelinated areas. Axons and neurons remained unaffected. Conclusion - The formation of giant mitochondria in myelin producing oligodendrocytes is the first pathological sign in the cuprizone experimental demyelination. Mitochondrium pathology in the cuprizone challenge might serve as a useful model to study the pathomechanism of multiple sclerosis subtypes (III and IV) characterized by primary oligodendrocyte degeneration.</p>"

The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of the 20-HETE inhibitor, HET0016, on myelin sheath after demylination in mice. Methods: We have studied the impact of HET0016 on remyelination using the toxic cuprizone model. Animals were assigned randomly to various groups and injected intraperitoneally with 10% lecithin or 2.0 and 0.2 mg/kg of HET0016 per day in 2 weeks. The animals were killed and the brains were reserved. We investigated spatial memory of mice using the Y-maze. We observed the myelin of corpus callosum by histochemical staining. Results: there were no significant differences in body weight, food intake and water intake between the model group and HET0016 (2.0mg/kg, 0.2mg/kg) group; spatial memory improved significantly in HET0016 (0.2mg/kg, 2.0mg/kg) group compared with model group; corpus callosum structure was significantly remyelinated after 2 weeks by HET0016 treatment.

947,2-s2.0-84863470698,MS plaque segmentation using masking clustering and level set method,"<p>In this study, a series of methods with some contributions have been proposed in order to segment brain tissues affected by the multiple sclerosis (MS). Since MS disease usually occurs in white matter of the brain and noting that corpus callosum is the largest white matter structure in the brain, filtering out the parts of corpus callosum that are not affected by disease helps improve segmentation. Magnetic resonance dual T1 - T2 images of the brain is used for masking corpus callosum. Since the pixel by pixel multiplication of T1 - T2 images is possible with dual MR Imaging and the outcome serves for the pupose of masking, the multiplication is used as preprocessing tool. Standart fuzzy clustering algorithm is used to find out the cluster centers. The speed term for the level set method is defined based on the cluster centers.

METHODS: One-way analysis of variance and multiple linear regression models were used to assess the relationship between MS subtype, the presence of enhancing lesions, and fractional anisotropy (FA)/mean diffusivity (MD) values of the genu, body, and splenium of the corpus callosum from 22 patients with RRMS and 25 patients with SPMS. RESULTS: Analyses of variance: The subjects with SPMS with enhancing lesions had significantly lower genu and body FA values than those with nonenhancing SPMS and significantly lower genu, body, and splenium FA values than those with RRMS. Regression models: Enhancement was associated with decreased genu FA (P = 0.014). Secondary progressive MS was associated with decreased genu (P = 0.002) and splenium FA (P &lt; 0.001) and significantly increased MD values. CONCLUSION: Patients with SPMS with enhancing lesions may be at increased risk for neuronal damage compared to nonenhancing SPMS and RRMS subtypes.

This study was conducted using the magnetic resonance imaging scans of 15 control subjects, 26 RRMS, and 14 SPMS patients. The data obtained from the landmark coordinates were analyzed with statistical shape analysis. The landmarks that were chosen to determine the shape differences of the CC and cerebellum have been identified and used in previous studies. In addition to these landmarks, constructed landmarks were determined and used to assess regional shape differences better. The shapes of the CC and cerebellum showed statistically significant differences from the controls when compared with both the RRMS and SPMS patients. It was found that the deformation observed from controls to SPMS was greater than the deformation from controls to RRMS, both for the CC and cerebellum. In conclusion, this study revealed CC and cerebellar shape change in RRMS and SPMS, and showed that deformations both in CC and cerebellum advances with the disease progression. © 2012 Wiley-Periodicals, Inc.</p>"

We assessed the prevalence and patterns of brain MRI abnormalities in a Brazilian cohort of patients with NMO. Conventional brain MRI and medical records from 24 Brazilian patients with NMO were retrospectively evaluated. Brain MRI were classified into four subgroups: normal, non-specific lesions, multiple sclerosis (MS)-like lesions, and typical lesions. Brain lesions were detected in 19 patients (79.2%). Fourteen patients (58.3%) had non-specific lesions, three (12.5%) had MS-like lesions, and two (8.3%) had typical lesions. Differences between these subgroups with respect to the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) scores (p = 0.86) were not significant. This study demonstrates a high prevalence of brain abnormalities in Brazilian patients with NMO; however, we did not find a significant relationship between these abnormalities and EDSS scores. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Methods: In 39 multiple sclerosis patients the area of corpus callosum in the sagittal plane, T<sub>2</sub> and T <sub>1</sub> lesion volumes, brain parenchymal fraction and brain atrophy were determined at baseline and 1 year after treatment initiation. Non-parametric and multiple regression models were built to identify the most reliable predictors of disability and of its changes over 9 years. Results: Corpus callosum atrophy during the first year of treatment was the best predictor of disability (r = -0.56) and of its increase at 9 years (r = 0.65). Corpus callosum atrophy of at least 2% predicted increase in disability with 93% sensitivity and 73% specificity (odds ratio = 35). Conclusion: Corpus callosum atrophy is a simple and accurate predictor of future disability accumulation and is feasible for routine clinical practice. © 2012 S. Karger AG, Basel.</p>"
953,2-s2.0-84860656906,Diosgenin promotes oligodendrocyte progenitor cell differentiation through estrogen receptor-mediated ERK1/2 activation to accelerate remyelination,"<p>Differentiation of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) into mature oligodendrocytes is a prerequisite for remyelination after demyelination, and impairment of this process is suggested to be a major reason for remyelination failure. Diosgenin, a plant-derived steroid, has been implicated for therapeutic use in many diseases, but little is known about its effect on the central nervous system. In this study, using a purified rat OPC culture model, we show that diosgenin significantly and specifically promotes OPC differentiation without affecting the viability, proliferation, or migration of OPC. Interestingly, the effect of diosgenin can be blocked by estrogen receptor (ER) antagonist ICI 182780 but not by glucocorticoid and progesterone receptor antagonist RU38486, nor by mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist spirolactone. Moreover, it is revealed that both ER-alpha and ER-beta are expressed in OPC, and diosgenin can activate the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) in OPC via ER. The pro-differentiation effect of diosgenin can also be obstructed by the ERK inhibitor PD98059. Furthermore, in the cuprizone-induced demyelination model, it is demonstrated that diosgenin administration significantly accelerates/enhances remyelination as detected by Luxol fast blue stain, MBP immunohistochemistry and real time RT-PCR. Diosgenin also increases the number of mature oligodendrocytes in the corpus callosum while it does not affect the number of OPCs. Taking together, our results suggest that diosgenin promotes the differentiation of OPC into mature oligodendrocyte through an ER-mediated ERK1/2 activation pathway to accelerate remyelination, which implicates a novel therapeutic usage of this steroidal natural product in demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS). © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p>"
954,2-s2.0-84862263947,IL-17-Induced Act1-Mediated signaling is critical for cuprizone-induced demyelination,"<p>Cuprizone inhibits mitochondrial function and induces demyelination in the corpus callosum, which resembles pattern III lesions in multiple sclerosis patients. However, the molecular and cellular mechanism by which cuprizone induces demyelination remains unclear. Interleukin-17 (IL-17) secreted by T helper 17 cells and γδT cells are essential in the development of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. In this study, we examined the importance of IL-17 signaling in cuprizone-induced demyelination. We found that mice deficient in IL-17A, IL-17 receptor C (IL-17RC), and adaptor protein Act1 (of IL-17R) all had reduced demyelination accompanied by lessened microglial and polydendrocyte cellular reactivity compared with that in wild-type mice in response to cuprizone feeding, demonstrating the essential role of IL-17-induced Act1-mediated signaling in cuprizone-induced demyelination. Importantly, specific deletion of Act1 in astrocytes reduced the severity of tissue injury in this model, indicating the critical role of CNS resident cells in the pathogenesis of cuprizone-induced demyelination. In cuprizone-fed mice, IL-17 was produced by CNS CD3 <sup>+</sup>T cells, suggesting a source of IL-17 in CNS upon cuprizone treatment. © 2012 the authors.</p>"

Materials and Methods: This work is health insurance portability and accountability act compliant. High resolution T1-weighted, dual echo, and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery and diffusion tensor MRI images were prospectively acquired on 68 RRMS patients (range, 25-58 years) and 68 age-matched controls. The data were analyzed using standardized human brain atlas-based tissue segmentation procedures to obtain regional volumes and their corresponding T2 relaxation times and DTI maps. Results: Group-averaged brain atlas-based qMRI maps of T2, fractional anisotropy and diffusivities are visually presented and compared between controls and RRMS. The analysis shows a widespread injury in RRMS. Atrophy of the corpus callosum (CC) was substantial in RRMS. The qMRI attributes of the neocortex in combination with the CC such as T2 and diffusivities were elevated and correlated with disability. Conclusion: Using a standardized multimodal qMRI acquisition and analyses that accounted for lesion distribution we demonstrate that cerebral pathology is widespread in RRMS. Our analysis of CC and neocortex qMRI metrics in relation to disability points to a neurodegenerative injury component that is independent from lesions. Copyright © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p>"
958,2-s2.0-84860994676,Influence of Corpus callosum damage on cognition and physical disability in multiple sclerosis: A multimodal study,"<p>Background: Corpus callosum (CC) is a common target for multiple sclerosis (MS) pathology. We investigated the influence of CC damage on physical disability and cognitive dysfunction using a multimodal approach. Methods: Twenty-one relapsing-remitting MS patients and 13 healthy controls underwent structural MRI and diffusion tensor of the CC (fractional anisotropy; mean diffusivity, MD; radial diffusivity, RD; axial diffusivity). Interhemisferic transfer of motor inhibition was assessed by recording the ipsilateral silent period (iSP) to transcranial magnetic stimulation. We evaluated cognitive function using the Brief Repeatable Battery and physical disability using the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) and the MS Functional Composite (MSFC) z-score. Results: The iSP latency correlated with physical disability scores (r ranged from 0.596 to 0.657, P values from 0.004 to 0.001), and with results of visual memory (r = -0.645, P = 0.002), processing speed (r = -0.51, P = 0.018) and executive cognitive domain tests (r = -0.452, P = 0.039). The area of the rostrum correlated with the EDSS (r = -0.442, P = 0.045). MD and RD correlated with cognitive performance, mainly with results of visual and verbal memory tests (r ranged from -0.446 to -0.546, P values from 0.048 to 0.011). The iSP latency correlated with CC area (r = -0.345, P = 0.049), volume (r = -0.401, P = 0.002), MD (r = 0.404, P = 0.002) and RD (r = 0.415, P = 0.016). Conclusions: We found evidence for structural and microstructural CC abnormalities associated with impairment of motor callosal inhibitory conduction in MS. CC damage may contribute to cognitive dysfunction and in less extent to physical disability likely through a disconnection mechanism. © 2012 Llufriu et al.</p>"
959,2-s2.0-84860691656,Investigating axonal damage in multiple sclerosis by diffusion tensor spectroscopy,"<p>Sensitive and specific in vivo measures of axonal damage, an important determinant of clinical status in multiple sclerosis (MS), might greatly benefit prognostication and therapy assessment. Diffusion tensor spectroscopy (DTS) combines features of diffusion tensor imaging and magnetic resonance spectroscopy, allowing measurement of the diffusion properties of intracellular, cell-type-specific metabolites. As such, it maybe sensitive to disruption of tissue microstructure within neurons. In this cross-sectional pilot study, diffusion of the neuronal metabolite N-acetylaspartate (NAA) was measured in the human normal-appearing corpus callosum on a 7 tesla MRI scanner, comparing 15 MS patients and 14 healthy controls. We found that NAA parallel diffusivity is lower in MS (p = 0.030) and inversely correlated with both water parallel diffusivity (p = 0.020) and clinical severity (p = 0.015). Interpreted in the context of previous experiments, our findings provide preliminary evidence that DTS can distinguish axonopathy from other processes such as inflammation, edema, demyelination, and gliosis. By detecting reduced diffusion of NAA parallel to axons in white matter, DTS may thus be capable of distinguishing axonal disruption in MS in the setting of increased parallel diffusion of water, which is commonly observed in MS but pathologically nonspecific. © 2012 the authors.</p>"

Methods We investigated the possible statistically significant variation of MD and FA in different MS patients, compared simultaneously, putting in comparison their normal appearing white matter (NAWM) and white matter affected by disease (plaques), both during activity and in remission, with normal white matter (NWM) of control subjects. Results Statistical analysis using Levene's test for comparison of variances revealed significant (P&lt;0.05) differences between FA values of the NWM of the controls and those of NAWM and active or inactive lesions, of the patients in the study. However, the differences between MD values of the NWM of the controls and those of NAWM and active or inactive lesions of the patients in the study were judged not significant (P&gt;0.05). Conclusion Imaging of MS using MRI techniques is constantly searching for reproducible quantitative parameter. This study shows how these parameters can be identified in the MD and FA values, and thus suggests the implementation of MRI routine protocols for diagnosing MS with the DTI analysis, since it can provide valuable information otherwise unobtainable. Key Points • Magnetic resonance imaging is widely performed in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients • Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) can be implemented using a 3T magnet • DTI provides quantitative parameters as mean diffusivity (MD) and fractional anisotropy (FA) • MD and, especially, FA can help evaluate the lesion load in MS patients and also assess variation in normal appearing white matter (NAWM) in MS. © European Society of Radiology 2012.</p>"
961,2-s2.0-84859932604,The T3-induced gene KLF9 regulates oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelin regeneration,"<p>Hypothyroidism is a well-described cause of hypomyelination. In addition, thyroid hormone (T3) has recently been shown to enhance remyelination in various animal models of CNS demyelination. What are the ways in which T3 promotes the development and regeneration of healthy myelin? To begin to understand the mechanisms by which T3 drives myelination, we have identified genes regulated specifically by T3 in purified oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs). Among the genes identified by genomic expression analyses were four transcription factors, Kruppel-like factor 9 (KLF9), basic helix-loop-helix family member e22 (BHLHe22), Hairless (Hr), and Albumin D box-binding protein (DBP), all of which were induced in OPCs by both brief and long term exposure to T3. To begin to investigate the role of these genes in myelination, we focused on the most rapidly and robustly induced of these, KLF9, and found it is both necessary and sufficient to promote oligodendrocyte differentiation in vitro. Surprisingly, we found that loss of KLF9 in vivo negligibly affects the formation of CNS myelin during development, but does significantly delay remyelination in cuprizone-induced demyelinated lesions. These experiments indicate that KLF9 is likely a novel integral component of the T3-driven signaling cascade that promotes the regeneration of lost myelin. Future analyses of the roles of KLF9 and other identified T3-induced genes in myelination may lead to novel insights into how to enhance the regeneration of myelin in demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.</p>"
962,2-s2.0-84859914779,Cuprizone-induced demyelination in the rat cerebral cortex and thyroid hormone effects on cortical remyelination,"<p>Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory demyelinating disease of the Central Nervous System which is characterized by multifocal demyelinated lesions dispersed throughout the brain. Although white matter lesions have been the most extensively studied, cortical demyelinaton lesions are also detected in MS brains.Cuprizone (CPZ)-induced demyelination in rodents has been widely used as a model for MS. Most of these studies focus on oligodendrocyte-rich structures, such as the corpus callosum (CC) and the cerebellar peduncles. However, it has been recently described that CPZ administration in mice also produces cortical demyelination, resembling some of the lesions found in MS patients. In this work we used CPZ-demyelinating model in Wistar rats to study demyelination in cortical forebrain areas. At the ultrastructural level, demyelination in the cortex was observed before detectable myelin loss in the subcortical white matter. During the course of CPZ intoxication Myelin Basic Protein immunodetection was decreased in cortical layers I-III due to a reduction in the number of cortical oligodendrocytes (OL). Oligodendroglial loss in CPZ-intoxicated rats correlated with an increase in the number of Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein positive astrocytes and a shift in the location of Carbonic Anhydrase II from OL to astrocytes. After removal of CPZ from the diet, we evaluate intranasal Thyroid hormone (TH) effects on the progression of cortical lesions. As previously reported in the CC, TH treatment also accelerates remyelination rate in the cortex compared to rats undergoing spontaneous remyelination. Our results suggest that manipulation of TH levels could be considered as a strategy to promote remyelination process in the cortex and to prevent neuronal irreversible damage in patients suffering from MS. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.</p>"
963,2-s2.0-84857033282,The cyclooxygenase-2 pathway via the PGE <inf>2</inf> EP2 receptor contributes to oligodendrocytes apoptosis in cuprizone-induced demyelination,"<p>Cyclooxygenases (COX)-1 and -2 are key enzymes required for the conversion of arachidonic acid to eicosanoids, potent mediators of inflammation. In patients with multiple sclerosis, COX-2 derived prostaglandins (PGs) are elevated in the CSF and COX-2 is up-regulated in demyelinating plaques. However, it is not known whether COX-2 activity contributes to oligodendrocyte death. In cuprizone-induced demyelination, oligodendrocyte apoptosis and a concomitant increase in the gene expression of COX-2 and PGE <sub>2</sub>-EP2 receptor precede histological demyelination. COX-2 and EP2 receptor were expressed by oligodendrocytes, suggesting a causative role for the COX-2/EP2 pathway in the initiation of oligodendrocyte death and demyelination. COX-2 gene deletion, chronic treatment with the COX-2 selective inhibitor celecoxib, or with the EP2 receptor antagonist AH6809 reduced cuprizone-induced oligodendrocyte apoptosis, the degree of demyelination and motor dysfunction. These data indicate that the PGE <sub>2</sub> EP2 receptor contributes to oligodendrocyte apoptosis and open possible new therapeutic approaches for multiple sclerosis. © 2011 International Society for Neurochemistry.</p>"

Recently, the virtual ""palpation"" of the brain has become feasible using magnetic resonance elastography, which quantifies biomechanical properties of the brain parenchyma by analyzing the propagation of externally elicited shear waves. However, the precise molecular and cellular patterns underlying changes of viscoelasticity measured by magnetic resonance elastography have not been investigated up to date. We assessed changes of viscoelasticity in a murine model of multiple sclerosis, inducing reversible demyelination by feeding the copper chelator cuprizone, and correlated our results with detailed histological analyses, comprising myelination, extracellular matrix alterations, immune cell infiltration and axonal damage. We show firstly that the magnitude of the complex shear modulus decreases with progressive demyelination and global extracellular matrix degradation, secondly that the loss modulus decreases faster than the dynamic modulus during the destruction of the corpus callosum, and finally that those processes are reversible after remyelination.</p>"
965,2-s2.0-84859414822,Tumefactive multiple sclerosis requiring emergent biopsy and histological investigation to confirm the diagnosis: A case report,"<p>Introduction. Tumefactive multiple sclerosis is a demyelinating disease that demonstrates tumor-like features on magnetic resonance imaging. Although diagnostic challenges without biopsy have been tried by employing radiological studies and cerebrospinal fluid examinations, histological investigation is still necessary for certain diagnosis in some complicated cases. Case presentation. A 37-year-old Asian man complaining of mild left leg motor weakness visited our clinic. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated high-signal lesions in bilateral occipital forceps majors, the left caudate head, and the left semicentral ovale on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery and T2-weighted imaging, and these lesions were enhanced by gadolinium-dimeglumin. Tumefactive multiple sclerosis was suspected because the enhancement indistinctly extended along the corpus callosum on magnetic resonance imaging and scintigraphy showed a low malignancy of the lesions. But oligoclonal bands were not detected in cerebrospinal fluid. In a few days, his symptoms fulminantly deteriorated with mental confusion and left hemiparesis, and steroid pulse therapy was performed. In spite of the treatment, follow-up magnetic resonance imaging showed enlargement of the lesions. Therefore, emergent biopsy was performed and finally led to the diagnosis of demyelinating disease. The enhanced lesion on magnetic resonance imaging disappeared after one month of prednisolone treatment, but mild disorientation and left hemiparesis remained as sequelae. Conclusions: Fulminant aggravation of the disease can cause irreversible neurological deficits. Thus, an early decision to perform a biopsy is necessary for exact diagnosis and appropriate treatment if radiological studies and cerebrospinal fluid examinations cannot rule out the possibility of brain tumors. © 2012 Yamada et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.</p>"

Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is sensitive in detecting acute brain tissue damage. We monitored SPMS patients over 12 months for diffusion changes within the corpus callosum (CC). Methods: Bimonthly MRI examinations over a 1-year period were performed on 11 SPMS patients. The protocol included postcontrast T1-weighted images and DTI. Based on the appearance of T1 enhancing lesion(s) during the study period, the patients were divided into enhancing (five patients) and nonenhancing (six patients) groups. Fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) of the genu, body, and splenium of the CC were measured and temporal changes in mean FA and MD were evaluated for each group as well as between groups. Immunology data from peripheral blood mononuclear cells were also collected on a monthly basis. Results: The enhancing group showed significant, progressive decrease in FA in body (p=0.012) and splenium (p=0.033) of CC, and significantly higher lymphotoxin-β levels. No significant FA changes were seen in the nonenhancing group. Moreover, the FA decline in the enhancing group deviated significantly from the nonenhancing group, which remained essentially stable. Although MD increased slightly in both groups, there was no significant difference between the two groups. Conclusion: Based on the MR and immunology findings, the results of our study suggest that DTI undergo more rapid and longitudinal changes in SPMS patients with inflammatory activity. © Springer-Verlag 2011.</p>"

The mechanisms of action of EPO in these conditions with shared immunological etiology are still unclear. Therefore, we used a model of toxic demyelination allowing exclusion of T cell-mediated inflammation. In a double-blind (for food/injections), placebo-controlled, longitudinal four-arm design, 8-wk-old C57BL/6 mice (n = 26/group) were assigned to cuprizone-containing (0.2%) or regular food (ground chow) for 6 wks. After 3 wks, mice were injected every other day with placebo or EPO (5,000 IU/kg intraperitoneally) until the end of cuprizone feeding. Half of the mice were exposed to behavioral testing, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and histology immediately after treatment cessation, whereas the other half were allowed a 3-wk treatment-free recovery. Immediately after termination of cuprizone feeding, all toxin-exposed mice were compromised regarding vestibulomotor function/coordination, with EPO-treated animals performing better than placebo. Likewise, ventricular enlargement after cuprizone, as documented by MRI, was less pronounced upon EPO. After a 3-wk recovery, remarkable spontaneous improvement was observed in all mice with no measurable further benefit in the EPO group (""ceiling effect""). Histological analysis of the corpus callosum revealed attenuation by EPO of the cuprizone-induced increase in microglial numbers and amyloid precursor protein accumulations as a readout of inflammation and axonal degeneration. To conclude, EPO ameliorates neurological symptoms in the cuprizone model of demyelination, possibly by reduction of inflammation-associated axonal degeneration in white matter tracts. These findings underscore the value of future therapeutic strategies for multiple sclerosis based on EPO or EPO variants.</p>"

Objectives: To determine the incidence of MS and describe the clinical, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings at onset of MS in children in Israel. Methods: Incidence and case-specific data were obtained through the MS Center Database and Israeli Health Statistics Census Data over 15 years, from 1995 to 2009, and compared between patients with childhood (&lt; 12 years), juvenile (≥ 12 years, ≤ 18 years) and adult (&gt; 18 years) MS onset. Results: Of 1129 eligible MS patients, we identified 10 (0.89%) with childhood-onset MS, 74 (6.55%) with juvenileonset MS, and 1045 (92.56%) with adult-onset MS. There were 0 to 3 incident childhood cases/year, leading to an annual incidence of 0.1/100,000 among Israeli children; the incidence of juvenile and adult MS was 2.6 and 5.4/100,000, respectively. Neurological presentation among children with MS was optic neuritis, motor weakness or brainstem involvement. CSF oligoclonal immunoglobulin (IgG) were positive in 62.5%. The most frequent MRI finding was the occurrence of ≥ 3 periventricular white matter lesions followed by corpus callosum lesions, with 71% co-occurrence. Cervical and thoracic lesions occurred in 33% and 43%, respectively. Time to second neurological event ranged from 0.3 to 4.2 years and none of the patients with childhood MS reached EDSS = 6.0 within a mean follow-up period of 8.4 years. Conclusions: Childhood-onset MS is rare, with an incidence of 0.1/100,000 Israeli children.

It is part of a spectrum of neurological conditions associated with antibodies to aquaporin-4 (AQP4). This study investigates the role of MRI where novel, more sensitive AQP4 antibody immunoassay techniques are being used. Methods: Retrospective review of neuroimaging in 69 patients (25 antibody positive, 44 antibody negative), investigated in the context of suspected NMO or NMO spectrum disorder, was performed independently by two consultant neuroradiologists. Results Longitudinally extensive, central spinal cord lesions were more frequent in AQP4 positive patients (95.2% vs 35.5%, p&lt;0.0001; 85.7% vs 45.2%, p=0.015). Multiple sclerosis diagnostic criteria were less frequently fulfilled on brain MRI in antibody positive patients (5.6% vs 33.3%, p=0.035). Juxtacortical and corpus callosal lesions were also less common in this group (16.7% vs 46.7%, p=0.063; 5.6% vs 46.7%, p=0.0034). Hypothalamic and periependymal disease related to the aqueduct was not seen in antibody negative patients. T1 hypointensity was more common in cord lesions of antibody positive patients (75.0% vs 35.3%, p=0.037). However, this characteristic did not discriminate antibody positive and negative longitudinally extensive cord lesions (73.3% vs 62.5%, p=0.66). Conclusion: The NMO spectrum of diseases are among an increasing number of neurological conditions defined by serological tests. However, despite improved immunoassay techniques, MRI of the brain and spinal cord continues to be among the first-line investigations in these patients, providing valuable diagnostic information that will help guide patient management. © Springer-Verlag 2011.</p>"

As PPMS patients show diffuse and global myelin loss, the aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of whole-brain myelin water fraction (MWF) imaging in PPMS. Specifically, we sought to use full-brain analysis techniques to: 1) determine the reproducibility of MWF estimates in PPMS brain; 2) compare MWF values in PPMS brain to healthy controls; and 3) establish the relationship between MWF and clinical disability, regionally and globally throughout the brain. Seventeen PPMS patients and seventeen age-matched controls were imaged using a whole-brain multi-component relaxation imaging technique to measure MWF. Analysis of MWF reduction was performed on three spatial levels: 1) histogram; 2) white matter skeleton; and 3) voxel-wise at the single-subject level. From histogram analysis, PPMS patients had significantly reduced global normal appearing white matter MWF (6%, p = 0.04) compared to controls. Focal lesions showed lower MWF values than white matter in controls (61%, p &lt; 0.001) and patients (59%, p &lt; 0.001). Along the white matter skeleton, MWF was diffusely reduced throughout the PPMS brain, with significant correlations between reduced MWF and increased clinical disability (more severe symptoms), as measured by the Expanded Disability Status Scale, within the corpus callosum and frontal, temporal, parietal and occipital white matter. Correlations with the more specific mental and sensory functional system scores were localized to clinically eloquent locations: reduced MWF was significantly associated with increased mental scores in anterior regions (i.e., frontal lobes and genu of the corpus callosum), and increased sensory scores in more posterior regions closer to the sensory cortex. Individual patient MWF maps were also compared to a normative population atlas, which highlighted areas of statistical difference between the individual patient and the population mean. A significant correlation was found between the volume of significantly reduced MWF and clinical disability (p = 0.008, R = 0.58).Our results show that clinical disability is reflected in particular regions of cerebral white matter that are consistent between subjects, and illustrates a method to examine tissue alteration throughout the brain of individual patients. These results strongly support the use of MWF imaging to evaluate disease activity in PPMS. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.</p>"
971,2-s2.0-84860358520,Expression of retinoid X receptor beta is induced in astrocytes during corpus callosum demyelination,"<p>The experimental activation of retinoid receptors reduces pathological symptoms in animal models of multiple sclerosis. In order to assess the involvement of endogenous retinoid signaling during the process of demyelination we investigated retinoic acid synthesizing enzymes and nuclear receptors using the mouse model of cuprizone toxicity. The initiation of myelin degradation in the corpus callosum was accompanied with a local increase of retinaldehyde dehydrogenase (RALDH) immunoreactivity. On the level of receptors we observed a striking increase in protein expression of the retinoid X receptor (RXR)-β in the affected corpus callosum. The RXRβ immunoreactivity appeared exclusively in astrocytes, where it reached a maximum at five weeks of treatment, following the RALDH response. In the cerebral cortex and basal ganglia of affected mice RXRβ was also observed in neurons. Among nuclear receptor antigens RARα showed a cuprizone associated increase in the corpus callosum. Quantitative RT-PCR revealed strong basal expression of RXRβ and a significant, over 20-fold upregulation of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ during demyelination. The results indicate that compensatory mechanisms during central demyelination may engage nuclear receptor dimers with an RXRβ partner. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.</p>"
972,2-s2.0-84855175563,Multiple white matter tract abnormalities underlie cognitive impairment in RRMS,"<p>Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is a sensitive tool for detecting microstructural tissue damage . in vivo. In this study, we investigated DTI abnormalities in individuals with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) and examined the relations between imaging-based measures of white matter injury and cognitive impairment. DTI-derived metrics using tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) were compared between 37 individuals with RRMS and 20 healthy controls. Cognitive impairment was assessed with three standard tests: the Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT), which measures cognitive processing speed and visual working memory, the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT), which examines verbal memory, and the Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT), which assesses sustained attention and working memory. Correlations between DTI-metrics and cognition were explored in regions demonstrating significant differences between the RRMS patients and the control group. Lower fractional anisotropy (FA) was found in RRMS participants compared to controls across the tract skeleton (0.40. ±. 0.03 . vs. 0.43. ±. 0.01, p. &lt;. 0.01). In areas of reduced FA, mean diffusivity was increased and was dominated by increased radial diffusivity with no significant change in axial diffusivity, an indication of the role of damage to CNS myelin in MS pathology. In the RRMS group, voxelwise correlations were found between FA reduction and cognitive impairment in cognitively-relevant tracts, predominantly in the posterior thalamic radiation, the sagittal stratum, and the corpus callosum; the strongest correlations were with SDMT measures, with contributions to these associations from both lesion and normal-appearing white matter. Moreover, results using threshold-free cluster enhancement (TFCE) showed more widespread white matter involvement compared to cluster-based thresholding. These findings indicate the important role for DTI in delineating mechanisms underlying MS-associated cognitive impairment and suggest that DTI could play a critical role in monitoring the clinical and cognitive effects of the disease. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.</p>"

The present study used diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to investigate whether occult brain damage exists in RNMO patients. DTI scans using a 3.0T MRI scanner were performed in 24 clinically confirmed RNMO patients whose conventional brain MRI results were normal, and also in 24 age- and sex-matched healthy control subjects. DTI data were processed to generate fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) maps, and region of interest (ROI) analyses were performed to obtain these parameters in white matter (including medulla oblongata, cerebral peduncle, optic radiation, genu of corpus callosum, splenium of corpus callosum, and internal capsule) and gray matter (including thalamus and putamen). Regional measures from patients at stable and acute phases were compared with healthy controls. Both acute and stable NMO patients had a higher average FA in ROIs of the thalamus and putamen. Acute NMO patients had significantly higher average MDs than controls in the genu of corpus callosum and optic radiation, and significantly lower average MDs in the medulla oblongata. Stable NMO patients had increased MDs in the genu of corpus callosum and optic radiation, but lower MDs in the medulla oblongata, internal capsule and thalamus. The DTI findings confirm the presence of occult tissue damage in normal-appearance white and gray matter, especially deep gray matter, in RNMO patients. This study adds further to the evidence that DTI is suitable as a tool for characterizing subtle brain tissue damage. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.</p>"

The pathogenesis of MS is not fully understood. Histopathology implicates both demyelination and axonal degeneration as the major contributors to the accumulation of disability. The application of several in vivo quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) methods to both lesioned and normal-appearing brain tissue has not yet provided a solid conclusive support of the hypothesis that MS might be a diffuse disease. In this work, we adopted FreeSurfer to provide standardized macrostructure or volumetry of lesion free normal-appearing brain tissue in combination with multiple quantitative MRI metrics (T<sub>2</sub> relaxation time, diffusion tensor anisotropy and diffusivities) that characterize tissue microstructural integrity. By incorporating a large number of healthy controls, we have attempted to separate the natural age-related change from the disease-induced effects. Our work shows elevation in diffusivity and relaxation times and reduction in volume in a number of normal-appearing white matter and gray matter structures in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis patients. These changes were related in part with the spatial distribution of lesions. The whole brain lesion load and age-adjusted expanded disability status score showed strongest correlations in regions such as corpus callosum with qMRI metrics that are believed to be specific markers of axonal dysfunction, consistent with histologic data of others indicating axonal loss that is independent of focal lesions. Our results support that MS at least in part has a neurodegenerative component. © 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.</p>"

Brain T <sub>2</sub>W-MRI disclosed hyperintense lesions in the corpus callosum and white matter. We diagnosed neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) on the basis of anti-aquaporin4 antibody seropositivity. PEG-IFN-α was discontinued, and she received steroid pulse therapy (intravenous high dose methylprednisolone). Two weeks later she also developed right optic neuritis. Repetitive steroid pulse therapy improved the left optic neuritis, but the upper half of the visual field of the right eye remained impaired. One month later she presented with mild dysarthria and mild left hemiparesis. Brain MRI disclosed an extensive pyramidal tract lesion from the right corona radiata to the pedunculus cerebri. This cerebral pyramidal tract lesion is associated with NMOSD. Our case corresponds to the past reports of optic neuritis or multiple sclerosis-like disease triggered by IFN-α. IFN-α may trigger NMOSD via a biological effect characteristic of Type I IFNs, a group that includes IFN-α and IFN-β.</p>"

Methods: Long-term locomotor performance of previously cuprizone-treated animals was monitored using the motor skill sequence (MOSS). Quantitative analysis of myelin proteome and histopathological analysis of neuronal/axonal integrity was performed after successful remyelination. Histopathological findings observed in experimental chronic remyelinated lesions were verified in chronic remyelinated lesions from multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. Results: Following cessation of cuprizone treatment, animals showed an initial recovery of locomotor performance. However, long after remyelination was completed (approximately 6 months after the last demyelinating episode), locomotor performance again declined in remyelinated animals as compared to age-matched controls. This functional decline was accompanied by brain atrophy and callosal axonal loss. Furthermore, the number of acutely damaged amyloid precursor protein-positive (APP+) axons was still significantly elevated in long-term remyelinated animals as compared to age-matched controls. Confocal analysis revealed that a substantial proportion of these APP+ spheroids were ensheathed by myelin, a finding that was confirmed in the chronic remyelinated lesions of MS patients. Moreover, quantitative analysis of myelin proteome revealed that remyelinated myelin displays alterations in composition that are in some aspects similar to the myelin of older animals. Interpretation: We propose that even after completed remyelination, axonal degeneration continues to progress at a low level, accumulating over time, and that once a threshold is passed axonal degeneration can become functionally apparent in the long-term. The presented model thus mimics some of the aspects of axonal degeneration in chronic progressive MS. Copyright © 2011 American Neurological Association.</p>"
977,2-s2.0-83055184202,Identification of a microglia phenotype supportive of remyelination,"<p>In multiple sclerosis, endogenous oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) attempt to remyelinate areas of myelin damage. During disease progression, however, these attempts fail. It has been suggested that modulating the inflammatory environment of the lesion might provide a promising therapeutic approach to promote endogenous remyelination. Microglia are known to play a central role in neuroinflammatory processes. To investigate the microglia phenotype that supports remyelination, we performed genome-wide gene expression analysis of microglia from the corpus callosum during demyelination and remyelination in the mouse cuprizone model, in which remyelination spontaneously occurs after an episode of toxin-induced primary demyelination. We provide evidence for the existence of a microglia phenotype that supports remyelination already at the onset of demyelination and persists throughout the remyelination process. Our data show that microglia are involved in the phagocytosis of myelin debris and apoptotic cells during demyelination. Furthermore, they express a cytokine and chemokine repertoire enabling them to activate and recruit endogenous OPCs to the lesion site and deliver trophic support during remyelination. This study not only provides a detailed transcriptomic analysis of the remyelination-supportive microglia phenotype but also reinforces the notion that the primary function of microglia is the maintenance of tissue homeostasis and the support of regeneration already at the earliest stages in the development of demyelinating lesions. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p>"
978,2-s2.0-84988891130,Extracting quantitative measures from EAP: A small clinical study using BFOR,"<p>The ensemble average propagator (EAP) describes the 3D average diffusion process of water molecules, capturing both its radial and angular contents, and hence providing rich information about complex tissue microstructure properties. Bessel Fourier orientation reconstruction (BFOR) is one of several analytical, non-Cartesian EAP reconstruction schemes employing multiple shell acquisitions that have recently been proposed. Such modeling bases have not yet been fully exploited in the extraction of rotationally invariant q-space indices that describe the degree of diffusion anisotropy/restrictivity. Such quantitative measures include the zero-displacement probability (Po), mean squared displacement (MSD), q-space inverse variance (QIV), and generalized fractional anisotropy (GFA), and all are simply scalar features of the EAP. In this study, a general relationship between MSD and q-space diffusion signal is derived and an EAP-based definition of GFA is introduced. A significant part of the paper is dedicated to utilizing BFOR in a clinical dataset, comprised of 5 multiple sclerosis (MS) patients and 4 healthy controls, to estimate Po, MSD, QIV, and GFA of corpus callosum, and specifically, to see if such indices can detect changes between normal appearing white matter (NAWM) and healthy white matter (WM). Although the sample size is small, this study is a proof of concept that can be extended to larger sample sizes in the future. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2012.</p>"
979,2-s2.0-84878260867,Astrogliosis during acute and chronic cuprizone demyelination and implications for remyelination.,"<p>In multiple sclerosis, microglia/macrophage activation and astrocyte reactivity are important components of the lesion environment that can impact remyelination. The current study characterizes these glial populations relative to expression of candidate regulatory molecules in cuprizone demyelinated corpus callosum. Importantly, periods of recovery after acute or chronic cuprizone demyelination are examined to compare conditions of efficient versus limited remyelination, respectively. Microglial activation attenuates after early demyelination. In contrast, astrocyte reactivity persists throughout demyelination and a 6-week recovery period following either acute or chronic demyelination. This astrocyte reaction is characterized by (a) early proliferation, (b) increased expression of GFAP (glial fibrillary acidic protein), Vim (vimentin), Fn1 (fibronectin) and CSPGs (chondroitin sulphate proteoglycans) and (c) elaboration of a dense network of processes. Glial processes elongated in the axonal plane persist throughout lesion areas during both the robust remyelination that follows acute demyelination and the partial remyelination that follows chronic demyelination. However, prolonged astrocyte reactivity with chronic cuprizone treatment does not progress to barrier formation, i.e. dense compaction of astrocyte processes to wall off the lesion area. Multiple candidate growth factors and inflammatory signals in the lesion environment show strong correlations with GFAP across the acute cuprizone demyelination and recovery time course, yet there is more divergence across the progression of chronic cuprizone demyelination and recovery. However, differential glial scar formation does not appear to be responsible for differential remyelination during recovery in the cuprizone model. The astrocyte phenotype and lesion characteristics in this demyelination model inform studies to identify triggers of non-remyelinating sclerosis in chronic multiple sclerosis lesions.</p>"

CMT1C disease was mapped to chromosome 16p12-p 13.3. To date only a few mutations in the LITAF gene have been reported. Due to a small group of CMT1C reported patients, the phenotype of CMT1C is poorly characterized. CMT1C disease is a pure demyelinating neuropathy limited to the peripheral nervous system with a mild clinical course, manifesting without any additional symptoms. To the best of our knowledge, in this study, for the first time we present a three generational CMT1C family in which in the proband, CMT1C disease coexists with central demyelination fulfilling criteria of primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS). The coexistence of PPMS and CMT1C in one family may not result from a common pathogenetic trait, however only in the proband with central demyelination and CMT1C we have detected a-308G&gt;A sequence variant in the promoter of the TNF-α gene.</p>"

The data was collected at two different sites in healthy controls to validate the independence of a specific setup. In addition, a group of patients with known white matter affections was investigated to compare two measures of myelin, i.e. relative and absolute myelin water content. Based on the first dataset, a quantitative myelin water content atlas was created which served as a control set for the other two datasets. Both control groups measured at different institutions yielded consistent results. However, distinct regions of reduced myelin water content were observed for the patient dataset, both on an individual basis and in a group-wise comparison. The comparison between the absolute and relative measurement of myelin water content in MS patients showed that the relative measurement, which is employed by many researchers, overestimates both disease volume and the corresponding reduction of myelin water content in white matter lesions. However, for normal appearing white matter, no difference between both approaches was detected. The results obtained in the current study demonstrate that absolute myelin water content can reliably be determined in a multicentre environment using standard MR sequences. The optimised protocol allows for a measurement of four quantitative parameters with full brain coverage in only 10 min. This might expedite a more widespread future use of quantitative MRI methods for clinical research and diagnosis. © 2012 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.</p>"

Background: Monophasic demyelinating illnesses can be indistinguishable clinically and radiologically, utilizing standard MRI studies. DTI studies in adults implicate the involvement of normal-appearing white matter (NAWM) in MS. Methods: Subjects with DTI studies (15 directions, 1.5 Tesla (GE), 3×3×3 mm, interpolated to 1.5×1.5×3 mm) were retrospectively identified. We studied three groups: childhood onset MS (n=18), monophasic illness (eight with acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM), seven with clinically isolated syndrome (CIS)) and age-matched controls. DTI had been obtained within one month of symptom onset for patients with ADEM and within a median of 20 months for the MS group. DTI measures were determined using a semi-automated method from standardized regions of interest (ROI) containing central fibers of the corpus callosum genu and internal capsule. Results: The MS group had significantly lower fractional anisotropy (FA) values compared to controls (p≤0.001), with increased radial diffusivity (RD) and decreased axial diffusivity (AD). In the monophasic group FA was smaller than the controls (p=0.01) with increased RD and no difference in AD. Conclusions: This retrospective analysis provides evidence that NAWM is affected in pediatric MS and monophasic demyelinating disease, with a potentially novel pattern demonstrating reduced AD in pediatric MS. Further larger scale confirmatory studies are needed to address whether the demonstrated DTI changes could be used as a biomarker in pediatric patients presenting with an initial demyelinating event. © The Author(s) 2012.</p>"

Objectives: We aimed to investigate whether conventional MRI changes over 1 year could predict cognitive and physical disability 5 years later in CIS. We performed analyses using a global approach (T<inf>2</inf> lesion load, number of T<inf>2</inf> lesions), but also a topographic approach. Methods: This study included 38 patients with a CIS. At inclusion, 10 out of 38 patients fulfilled the 2010 revised McDonald's criteria for the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis. Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) evaluation was performed at baseline, year 1 and year 5, and cognitive evaluation at baseline and year 5. T<inf>2</inf>-weighted MRI was performed at baseline and year 1. We used voxelwise analysis to analyse the predictive value of lesions location for subsequent disability. Results: Using the global approach, no correlation was found between MRI and clinical data. The occurrence or growth of new lesions in the brainstem was correlated with EDSS changes over the 5 years of follow-up. The occurrence or growth of new lesions in cerebellum, thalami, corpus callosum and frontal lobes over 1 year was correlated with cognitive impairment at 5 years. Conclusion: The assessment of lesion location at the first stage of multiple sclerosis may be of value to predict future clinical disability. © The Author(s) 2012.</p>"

Objective: We aimed to study a potential benefit of 7T MRI for (i) the differentiation between Susac syndrome and MS and (ii) the clarification of pathogenesis of Susac syndrome. Methods: Five patients suffering from Susac syndrome, 10 sex- and age-matched patients with relapsing-remitting MS (median Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score 1.5) and 15 matching healthy controls were investigated at 7 Tesla MRI. The protocol included T1-weighted MPRAGE, T2*-weighted FLASH, and TIRM sequences. Results: Almost all T2*FLASH lesions in patients with MS were centred by a small central vein (325 lesions; 92%) and often showed a small hypointense rim (145 lesions; 41%). In contrast, white matter lesions in Susac syndrome exhibited a perivascular setting significantly less frequently (148 lesions; 54%, p=0.002), and very rarely exhibited a hypointense rim (12 lesions; 4%, p=0.004). Furthermore, in addition to callosal atrophy, Susac patients showed cerebrospinal fluidisointense lesions within the central part of corpus callosum that are not commonly seen in MS. Conclusion: At 7T MRI, plaques in MS patients and patients with Susac syndrome differed substantially with respect to morphology and pattern. Thus, lesion morphology at 7T (i) may serve as a marker to distinguish Susac syndrome from MS and (ii) reflects a different pathophysiological mechanism underlying Susac syndrome, for example microinfarction rather than demyelination. © The Author(s) 2012.</p>"

Materials and methods: Forty-two definite OSMS with seronegative NMO-IgG and 23 NMO with seropositive NMO-IgG, and 27 age-matched normal controls (NC) were recruited. Sagittal T2-FLAIR images with 2-mm slice thickness were obtained. Subcallosal dot-dash (SCDD) sign and subcallosal striations (SCS) sign were reviewed. Results: SCDD was more commonly detected in OSMS (28 of 42 patients) than in NMO (5 of 23 patients) (P &lt; 0.05). SCS showed no difference between OSMS (31 of 42 patients) and NMO (12 of 23 patients) (P &gt; 0.05). For comparing ROC analysis among SCDD, SCS, and SCDD + SCS for predicted probability through binary logistic regression analysis, SCDD + SCS had the largest area under ROC curve (0.777) than SCDD (0.725) and SCS (0.608). Conclusion: SCDD may be helpful in distinguishing OSMS from NMO. The regression equation may also be a simple and effective method of choice for the differentiation between OSMS and NMO. © 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.</p>"

The cohort studied included 75 patients, 38 patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) and 37 patients with acquired brain injuries (ABI) referred to the neurorehabilitation department from April 2009 to March 2010. Data included age, gender, diagnoses, complications, spasticity, length of stay, Rehabilitation Complexity Scale (RCS) and Northwick Park Dependency (NPDS) scores on admission and discharge. Forward stepwise multiple regressions were performed considering Spasticity as dependent and considering NPDS, RCS on admission and discharge, age, gender and length of stay as independent variables. Standardized intra-axial lesions in those with spasticity were fused with standardized axial DTIs from normal controls obtained under 3 T and 1.5 T MRI scanners. Spasticity was present in 36 patients. Regression was found between spasticity and all the other variables with r = 0.42, r<sup>2</sup> = 0.17, <sub>adj</sub>r<sup>2</sup> = 0.12<sup>r</sup>, F<sub>(4.66)</sub>= 3.53, p &lt; 0.01. Residuals were acceptable. If the same is calculated excluding MS patients the results are higher with: r = 0.59, r<sup>2</sup> = 0.35, <sub>adj</sub>2 = 0.30, F<sub>(2.27)</sub> = 7.1885, p &lt; 0.003. In MS subjects, spasticity appeared if lesions affected pyramidal tracts, callosal radiations extensively or brainstem. Those with ABI did develop spasticity if the lesion involved the internal capsules, pericommissural areas, optochiasmatic cistern or brainstem. Findings suggest that NPDSa and discharge and RCSd are higher in those developing spasticity. No obvious correlation between spasticity and RCSa was found. Subjects with MS are more likely to develop spasticity especially if the lesions are numerous and affect the corticospinal tracts, callosal radiations extensively or brainstem. In patients with ABI lesions affecting pyramidal tracts, pericommissural areas and optochiasmatic cisterns seem more likely to develop spasticity.</p>"
987,2-s2.0-84863831579,Feasibility of in vivo myelin water imaging using 3D multigradient-echo pulse sequences,"<p>Quantitative myelin water imaging is able to show demyelinating processes and, therefore, provides insight into the pathology of white matter diseases such as multiple sclerosis. So far, mapping of the myelin water fraction most often was performed using single-slice multiecho spin-echo sequences. Recently, a different approach using two-dimensional multigradient-echo pulse sequences was suggested. In this work, a solution to three-dimensional in vivo myelin water fraction imaging is presented that applies multigradient-echo pulse sequences and uses non-negative least squares algorithms to analyze the multicomponent T<sub>2</sub><sup>*</sup> decay. The suggested method offers not only whole brain coverage but also clinically practicable acquisition times. The obtained myelin water fraction values are low (6.9% for white matter) but are able to detect demyelination in multiple sclerosis lesions. However, the clinical application of the proposed method remains questionable, because further measurements that clarify the possibility of detecting ongoing processes in lesions are needed.

988,2-s2.0-84863252517,Brain lesion location and clinical status 20 years after a diagnosis of clinically isolated syndrome suggestive of multiple sclerosis,"<p>Background/Objectives: The objective of this study was to investigate associations between the spatial distribution of brain lesions and clinical outcomes in a cohort of people followed up 20 years after presentation with a clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) suggestive of multiple sclerosis (MS). Methods: Brain lesion probability maps (LPMs) of T1 and T2 lesions were generated from 74 people who underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and clinical assessment a mean of 19.9 years following a CIS. One-tailed t-test statistics were used to compare LPMs between the following groups: clinically definite (CD) MS and those who remained with CIS, with an abnormal MRI; people with MS and an Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) ≤3 and &gt;3; people with relapsing-remitting (RR) and secondary progressive (SP) MS. The probability of each voxel being lesional was analysed adjusting for age and gender using a multiple linear regression model. Results: People with CDMS were significantly more likely than those with CIS and abnormal scan 20 years after onset to have T1 and T2 lesions in the corona radiata, optic radiation, and splenium of the corpus callosum (periventricularly) and T2 lesions in the right fronto-occipital fasciculus. People with MS EDSS &gt;3, compared with those with EDSS ≤3, were more likely to have optic radiation and left internal capsule T2 lesions. No significant difference in lesion distribution was noted between RRMS and SPMS. Conclusion: This work demonstrates that lesion location characteristics are associated with CDMS and disability after long-term follow-up following a CIS. The lack of lesion spatial distribution differences between RRMS and SPMS suggests focal pathology affects similar regions in both subgroups. © 2012 SAGE Publications.</p>"

The method utilizes a single image with off-resonance saturation, a reference image for data normalization, and T<sub>1</sub>, B<sub>0</sub>, and B<sub>1</sub> maps with the total acquisition time ∼10 min for whole-brain imaging. Macromolecular proton fraction maps are reconstructed by iterative solution of the matrix pulsed magnetization transfer equation with constrained values of other model parameters. Theoretical error model describing the variance due to noise and the bias due to deviations of constrained parameters from their actual values was formulated based on error propagation rules. The method was validated by comparison with the conventional multiparameter multipoint fit of the pulsed magnetization transfer model based on data from two healthy subjects and two multiple sclerosis patients. It was demonstrated theoretically and experimentally that accuracy of the method depends on the offset frequency and flip angle of the saturation pulse, and optimal ranges of these parameters are 4-7 kHz and 600°-900°, respectively. At optimal sampling conditions, the single-point method enables &lt;10% relative macromolecular proton fraction errors. Comparison with the multiparameter fitting method revealed very good agreement with no significant bias and limits of agreement around 60.7%. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p>"

A comparative TMS study,"<p>Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a neurophysiological technique employed to assess the functional cortico-spinal integrity of healthy subjects, as well as the changes occurred due to various pathologies (multiple sclerosis, stroke, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, agenesis of the corpus callosum, movements disorders, migraine, depression, schizophrenia). In Parkinson's disease (PD), single-pulse TMS provides valuable information on intracortical inhibition and facilitation mechanism alteration. A comparative analysis conducted on two groups of Parkinson's disease patients and healthy volunteers reveals a reduction of the electrical cortical silent period (which is an intracortical inhibition marker) and a facilitation decrease in the motor areas corresponding to the upper limbs (UL) in PD patients.</p>"
992,2-s2.0-84857528669,A representative cohort of patients with non-progressive multiple sclerosis at the age of normal life expectancy,"<p>Multiple sclerosis may have a non-progressive symptomatology for decades; however, it is not clear whether the disease activity may abate completely. We identified a cohort of patients, resident in Gothenburg at the time of disease onset, between the years 1950-64 (n = 307). These geographical and temporal restrictions, along with favourable conditions for a 'spider' epidemiological study, were optimal for an unbiased selection; this 15-year incidence cohort was essentially followed prospectively for 37-59 years after onset. The shortest follow-up time for patients without primary or secondary progression was 45 years. For patients with an initial relapsing-remitting course and multiple sclerosis diagnosis according to the Poser criteria (n = 202), the probability of non-progressive disease after 40 years was 22% (standard error 3.0%), and after 50 years it was 14% (standard error 3.2%). For attack onset including patients with possible multiple sclerosis, the corresponding probabilities after 40 and 50 years were 35% (standard error 3.3%) and 28% (standard error 3.5%), respectively. At the last follow-up in 2009-10, when patients reached the average age of the Swedish population life expectancy, only 13 patients from the multiple sclerosis diagnosis cohort, according to the Poser criteria, remained alive and non-progressive. Their annualized attack frequency diminished with time from 0.29 to 0.015. These patients had been functioning well socially. Nine patients had an Expanded Disability Status Scale score of 0-2.5, and four patients had a score of 3 or 3.5, with deficits dating back to attacks decades ago. Eight patients participated in a complete neuropsychological examination, which showed a slight difference (P &lt; 0.01) concerning verbal memory and executive function compared to an age and socially matched reference group, whereas results for five other cognitive domains were within the normal range. Magnetic resonance images fulfilled the Barkhof-Tintoré criteria for multiple sclerosis in 10 of 11 patients, with conspicuously few subcortical lesions relative to extensive periventricular lesions and lesions extending from the inferior midline aspect of the corpus callosum. Prediction of the non-progressive stage was possible with moderate hazard ratios and low sensitivity. Early features that predicted a non-progressive course were complete remission of the onset attack, low or moderate initial relapse frequency and - when the patients with possible multiple sclerosis were included - dominating afferent symptoms. The clinical disease activity had abated in these 13 patients, with the caveat that transition to secondary progression continued to occur after four decades, albeit with decreasing risk. © The Author (2012).</p>"
993,2-s2.0-84856228565,Adult CNP::EGFP transgenic mouse shows pronounced hypomyelination and an increased vulnerability to cuprizone-induced demyelination,"<p>CNP::EGFP transgenic mice, genetically engineered to express the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) under the control of the 2-3-cyclic nucleotide 3-phosphodiesterase (CNPase) promoter in oligodendroglial and Schwann cells, constitute a very important and widely used tool for the study of oligodendrocyte (OLG) development and function in young mice. Our results showed that CNP::EGFP mice were significantly more susceptible to CPZ-induced demyelination, as evaluated by MBP immunostaining, oligodendroglial progenitor cell (OPC) recruitment and astroglial, microglial and nestin response. This enhanced vulnerability was a consequence of their hypomyelination. CNP::EGFP control mice also displayed a significant decrease in corpus callosum (CC) thickness and MBP immunoreactivity. Morphometric analysis further showed a significant decrease in the frequency of myelinated axons, myelin turns (lamellae) and g-ratio carried out in the optic nerve (ON) and CC of CNP::EGFP, as compared to WT mice. Moreover, our results showed a decrease in the number of axons of small caliber, concomitantly with an increase in the number of axons of bigger size with more and enlarged mitochondria, which suggests a high energy demand. These findings and those displaying that MBP+ cells and NF200 staining in the CNP::EGFP cortex were more sparsely distributed provide evidence of axonal loss, which was supported by a decreased number of NeuN+ cells in the CA3 fields of the hippocampus. Transgenic mice also showed an increase in microglial and astroglial activation, accompanied by enhanced lipid peroxidation and recruitment of morphologically altered OPC. Finally, CNPase protein levels proved to be lower than MBP in the CC, which might indicate an altered pattern in myelin proteins with a CNPase deficiency. Behavioral analysis of adult CNP::EGFP transgenic mice supported our results, as it revealed a decrease in locomotion, exploratory activity and motor impairment, as compared to their WT littermates. Our data highlight the relevance of confronting results obtained in adult CNP::EGFP mice with those observed in WT mice. According to our findings, CNP::EGFP hypomyelination might be triggered by the cellular stress induced by the high level of EGFP expression in mature OLG. Adult CNP::EGFP mice could be considered a useful tool to evaluate future therapies for demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS), since these animals present chronic demyelination with axonal degeneration, a characteristic of such pathologies. © 2011 Elsevier Inc..</p>"
994,2-s2.0-84855918491,Diffusion Tensor Imaging of Corpus Callosum Integrity in Multiple Sclerosis: Correlation with Disease Variables,"<p>Background and purpose: Corpus callosum (CC) is frequently involved in multiple sclerosis (MS). We aimed to investigate the relations between CC microstructure integrity as measured by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in relapsing-remitting MS patients with low neurological disability in comparison with age-matched healthy subjects and further to identify correlations between DTI-CC parameters and clinical variables of MS disease activity. Methods: CC volume was measured on 3.0T brain MRI by MS Analyze software. DTI metrics acquired along 31 independent directions were obtained and fractional anisotropy (FA), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), longitudinal (λ1) and transverse (λ 2, λ 3) diffusivities were measured in MS patients and healthy subjects. Disease activity was assessed by relapse rate and neurolgical disability by the Extended Disability Status Scale (EDSS). Results: Thirty relapsing-remitting MS patients and 30 age- and sex-matched healthy subjects were studied. CC volume and DTI metrics differed significantly between MS patients and healthy subjects. In MS patients, all DTI parameters correlated with neurological disability. ADC, longitudinal and transverse diffusivity correlated with disease duration. ADC and the transverse diffusivity correlated with relapse rate. Conclusions: CC DTI parameters, especially ADC and transverse diffusivity correlated with disease variables especially with those associated with clinical activity. © 2010 by the American Society of Neuroimaging.</p>"
995,2-s2.0-84255175912,Nonexponential T<inf>2</inf>* decay in white matter,"<p>Visualizing myelin in human brain may help the study of diseases such as multiple sclerosis. Previous studies based on T<sub>1</sub> and T<sub>2</sub> relaxation contrast have suggested the presence of a distinct water pool that may report directly on local myelin content. Recent work indicates that T <sub>2</sub>* contrast may offer particular advantages over T<sub>1</sub> and T<sub>2</sub> contrast, especially at high field. However, the complex mechanism underlying T<sub>2</sub>* relaxation may render interpretation difficult. To address this issue, T<sub>2</sub>* relaxation behavior in human brain was studied at 3 and 7 T. Multiple gradient echoes covering most of the decay curve were analyzed for deviations from mono-exponential behavior. The data confirm the previous finding of a distinct rapidly relaxing signal component (T<sub>2</sub>* ∼ 6 ms), tentatively attributed to myelin water. However, in extension to previous findings, this rapidly relaxing component displayed a substantial resonance frequency shift, reaching 36 Hz in the corpus callosum at 7 T. The component's fractional amplitude and frequency shift appeared to depend on both field strength and fiber orientation, consistent with a mechanism originating from magnetic susceptibility effects. The findings suggest that T<sub>2</sub>* contrast at high field may be uniquely sensitive to tissue myelin content and that proper interpretation will require modeling of susceptibility-induced resonance frequency shifts.

996,2-s2.0-83155192141,Demyelination and remyelination in anatomically distinct regions of the corpus callosum following cuprizone intoxication,"<p>Multiple sclerosis is a chronic demyelinating disease of the central nervous system. Spontaneous remyelination during early disease stages is thought to preserve and partially restore function. However, this process ceases in later stages despite the presence of pre-oligodendrocytes. Cuprizone-induced demyelination is a useful model with which to study the remyelination process. Previous studies have demonstrated heterogeneities in demyelination in individual animals. Here we investigated regional differences in demyelination and remyelination within the corpus callosum. C57BL/6 mice were fed 0.2% cuprizone for 5 weeks to induce demyelination. Remyelination was examined 2-5 weeks after cuprizone withdrawal. Immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy were used to quantify regional differences in demyelination, gliosis, and remyelination. We found that, while demyelination was limited in the rostral region of corpus callosum, nearly complete demyelination occurred in the caudal callosum, beginning at approximately -0.5. mm from bregma. Astrogliosis and microgliosis were correlated with demyelination and differed between the rostral and caudal callosal structures. Remyelination upon cessation of cuprizone ensued at different rates with splenium remyelinating faster than dorsal hippocampal commissure. Our data show anatomical differences of cuprizone-induced demyelination and remyelination in the corpus callosum and the importance of examining specific callosal regions in myelin repair studies using this model. © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd and the Japan Neuroscience Society.</p>"
997,2-s2.0-81955168006,Fibroblast growth factor 1 (FGFR1) modulation regulates repair capacity of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells following chronic demyelination,"<p>The adult mammalian brain contains multiple populations of endogenous progenitor cell types. However, following CNS trauma or disease, the regenerative capacity of progenitor populations is typically insufficient and may actually be limited by non-permissive or inhibitory signals in the damaged parenchyma. Remyelination is the most effective and simplest regenerative process in the adult CNS yet is still insufficient following repeated or chronic demyelination. Our previous in vitro studies demonstrated that fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) signaling inhibited oligodendrocyte progenitor (OP) differentiation into mature oligodendrocytes. Therefore, we questioned whether FGFR1 signaling may inhibit the capacity of OP cells to generate oligodendrocytes in a demyelinating disease model and whether genetically reducing FGFR1 signaling in oligodendrocyte lineage cells could enhance the capacity for remyelination. FGFR1 was found to be upregulated in the corpus callosum during cuprizone mediated demyelination and expressed on OP cells just prior to remyelination. Plp/CreER <sup>T</sup>:Fgfr1 <sup>fl/fl</sup> mice were administered tamoxifen to induce conditional Fgfr1 deletion in oligodendrocyte lineage cells. Tamoxifen administration during chronic demyelination resulted in reduced FGFR1 expression in OP cells. OP proliferation and population size were not altered one week after tamoxifen treatment. Tamoxifen was then administered during chronic demyelination and mice were given a six week recovery period without cuprizone in the chow. After the recovery period, OP numbers were reduced and the number of mature oligodendrocytes was increased, indicating an effect of FGFR1 reduction on OP differentiation. Importantly, tamoxifen administration in Plp/CreER <sup>T</sup>:Fgfr1 <sup>fl/fl</sup> mice significantly promoted remyelination and axon integrity. These results demonstrate a direct effect of FGFR1 signaling in oligodendrocyte lineage cells as inhibiting the repair capacity of OP cells following chronic demyelination in the adult CNS. © 2011.</p>"

This study examined the relationship between white matter microstructure and academic ability in 31 youths with multiple sclerosis (aged 11-19 years) and 34 demographically matched controls. Using diffusion tensor imaging, fractional anisotropy was calculated in corpus callosum and in lateralized hemispheric lobes. Difficulties with written arithmetic ability were observed in 26% of patients. Arithmetic ability correlated with fractional anisotropy values across all segments of the corpus callosum and in right frontal and parietal regions, controlling for age (r values &gt;0.5, P&lt;0.005). Findings highlight the functional impact of compromised white matter microstructure across diffuse regions of the brain on mathematical ability. © 2011 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins.</p>"

In multiple sclerosis (MS) neurotrophins released from PBMCs might play a neuroprotective role, delaying neurodegeneration within central nervous system. We aimed for identifying the link between neurotrophins' PBMCs expression and brain atrophy markers in relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) patients. We have found that neurotrophin-3 PBMCs concentration is strongly correlated with brain-parenchymal fraction and corpus callosum cross-sectional area, which are well-established brain atrophy measures. Thus, PBMC-derived neurotrophin-3 might exert a direct or indirect neuroprotective effect in MS. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.</p>"

1001,2-s2.0-84856680094,Automated corpus callosum extraction via Laplace-Beltrami nodal parcellation and intrinsic geodesic curvature flows on surfaces,"<p>Corpus callosum (CC) is an important structure in human brain anatomy. In this work, we propose a fully automated and robust approach to extract corpus callosum from T1-weighted structural MR images. The novelty of our method is composed of two key steps. In the first step, we find an initial guess for the curve representation of CC by using the zero level set of the first nontrivial Laplace-Beltrami (LB) eigenfunction on the white matter surface. In the second step, the initial curve is deformed toward the final solution with a geodesic curvature flow on the white matter surface. For numerical solution of the geodesic curvature flow on surfaces, we represent the contour implicitly on a triangular mesh and develop efficient numerical schemes based on finite element method. Because our method depends only on the intrinsic geometry of the white matter surface, it is robust to orientation differences of the brain across population. In our experiments, we validate the proposed algorithm on 32 brains from a clinical study of multiple sclerosis disease and demonstrate that the accuracy of our results. © 2011 IEEE.</p>"
1002,2-s2.0-84055217299,Inflammation-induced subventricular zone dysfunction leads to olfactory deficits in a targeted mouse model of multiple sclerosis,"<p>Neural stem cells (NSCs) persist in defined brain niches, including the subventricular zone (SVZ), throughout adulthood and generate new neurons destined to support specific neurological functions. Whether brain diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS) are associated with changes in adult NSCs and whether this might contribute to the development and/or persistence of neurological deficits remains poorly investigated. We examined SVZ function in mice in which we targeted an MS-like pathology to the forebrain. In these mice, which we refer to herein as targeted EAE (tEAE) mice, there was a reduction in the number of neuroblasts compared with control mice. Altered expression of the transcription factors Olig2 and Dlx2 in the tEAE SVZ niche was associated with amplification of pro-oligodendrogenic transit-amplifying cells and decreased neuroblast generation, which resulted in persistent reduction in olfactory bulb neurogenesis. Altered SVZ neurogenesis led to impaired long-term olfactory memory, mimicking the olfactory dysfunction observed in MS patients. Importantly, we also found that neurogenesis was reduced in the SVZ of MS patients compared with controls. Thus, our findings suggest that neuroinflammation induces functional alteration of adult NSCs that may contribute to olfactory dysfunction in MS patients.</p>"

There is no or only weak correlation between conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) parameters and level of fatigue. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between progression of corpus callosum (CC) atrophy and fatigue in MS patients. This was a cohort study in 70 patients with relapsing form of MS (RRMS) and serial MRIs over a mean follow-up of 4.8 years [67% female, mean age 42 ± 11 years, mean disease duration 9.7 ± 7.6 years, mean Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) 2.8 ± 1.6]. Fatigue was assessed by the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS). CC size was measured with the CC index (CCI). In total, 40% of the patients suffered from fatigue (mean FSS score 5.3 ±1.1) and 60% patients had no fatigue (mean FSS score of 2.1 ± 1). Patients with fatigue had higher EDSS scores (p = 0.01) and CC atrophy was more pronounced in patients with fatigue (-21.8 vs.-12.1%, p = 0.005). FSS correlated with CCI change over time (r = -0.33; p = 0.009) and EDSS (p = 0.008; r = 0.361). The association between annualized CCI change and FSS was independent from EDSS, disease duration, gender and age in a multivariate linear regression analysis (p\0.001). Progression of CC atrophy may play a role in the evolution of MS-related fatigue. © Springer-Verlag 2011.</p>"
1004,2-s2.0-81255170303,MRI parameters for prediction of multiple sclerosis diagnosis in children with acute CNS demyelination: A prospective national cohort study,"<p>Background: Multiple sclerosis (MS) diagnostic criteria incorporate MRI features that can be used to predict later diagnosis of MS in adults with acute CNS demyelination. To identify MRI predictors of a subsequent MS diagnosis in a paediatric population, we created a standardised scoring method and applied it to MRI scans from a national prospective incidence cohort of children with CNS demyelination. Methods: Clinical and MRI examinations were done at the onset of acute CNS demyelination and every 3 months in the first year after that, and at the time of a second demyelinating attack. MS was diagnosed on the basis of clinical or MRI evidence of relapsing disease. Baseline MRI scans were assessed for the presence of 14 binary response parameters. Parameters were assessed with a multiple tetrachoric correlation matrix. Univariate analyses and multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used to identify predictors of MS. Findings: Between Sept 1, 2004, and June 30, 2010, 332 children and adolescents were assessed for eligibility. 1139 scans were available from 284 eligible participants who had been followed up for 3·9 (SD 1·7) years. 57 (20%) were diagnosed with MS after a median of 188 (IQR 144-337) days. Seven of 14 binary response parameters were retained. The presence of either one or more T1-weighted hypointense lesions (hazard ratio 20·6, 95% CI 5·46-78·0) or one or more periventricular lesions (3·34, 1·27-8·83) was associated with an increased likelihood of MS diagnosis (sensitivity 84%, specificity 93%, positive predictive value 76%, negative predictive value 96%). Risk for MS diagnosis was highest when both parameters were present (34·27, 16·69-70·38). Although the presence of contrast enhancement, cerebral white matter, intracallosal, and brainstem lesions was associated with MS in the univariate analyses, these parameters were not retained in the multivariable models. Interpretation: Specific MRI parameters can be used to predict diagnosis of MS in children with incident demyelination of the CNS. The ability to promptly identify children with MS will enhance timely access to care and will be important for future clinical trials in paediatric MS.

1005,2-s2.0-80053995816,"De- and remyelination in the CNS white and grey matter induced by cuprizone: The old, the new, and the unexpected","<p>The copper chelator cuprizone (biscyclohexanone oxaldihydrazone) was established as a neurotoxin in rodents in 1966 by Carlton. During the following years the usefulness of cuprizone feeding in mice to induce oligodendrocyte death with secondary demyelination of the superior cerebellar peduncles was described by Blakemore. In 1998 the cuprizone model experienced a renaissance as the group of Matsushima described the effects of cuprizone on the white matter of the cerebrum and focussed on demyelination in the corpus callosum, where the extent of demyelination could be scored more easily and consistently. Since then the toxic cuprizone model has been widely used to study experimental de- and remyelination in the corpus callosum. Recently, we and others have extended these studies and have shown several new aspects characteristic for this model. Many lessons can be learned from these recent findings that have implications for the basic understanding of remyelination and the design of remyelinating and neuroprotective strategies in demyelinating diseases of the CNS. Although the model is often mentioned in the context of multiple sclerosis, it must always be kept in mind that this model has a fundamentally different induction of demyelination. We highlight the important findings delineated from this model and critically discuss both the advantages and the shortcomings of cuprizone induced demyelination.</p>"

Recent neuroimaging approaches including resting state functional connectivity MRI (fcMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) have been used to assess brain functional (fcMRI) and structural (DTI) network connectivity, allowing for more integrative assessments of distributed neural systems than in the past. Declines in corpus callosum size and microstructure with advancing age have been well documented, but their contributions to age deficits in unimanual and bimanual function are not well defined. Our recent work implicates age-related declines in callosal size and integrity as a key contributor to unimanual and bimanual control deficits. Moreover, our data provide evidence for a fundamental shift in the balance of excitatory and inhibitory interhemispheric processes that occurs with age, resulting in age differences in the relationship between functional and structural network connectivity. Training studies suggest that the balance of interhemispheric interactions can be shifted with experience, making this a viable target for future interventions. © 2011 Fling, Peltier, Bo, Welsh and Seidler.</p>"
1007,2-s2.0-79957876410,Mesenchymal stem cells enhance the engraftment and myelinating ability of allogeneic oligodendrocyte progenitors in dysmyelinated mice,"<p>Multiple sclerosis is an autoimmune disease characterized by demyelination and axonal loss throughout the central nervous system. No regenerative treatment exists for patients who fail to respond to conventional immunosuppressive and immunomodulating drugs. In this scenario, stem cell therapy poses as a rational approach for neurological regeneration. Transplantation of embryonic-derived oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) has been shown to promote remyelination and ameliorate animal models of neurodegenerative diseases. However, its therapeutic application is limited due to potential transplant rejection. In multiple sclerosis, an added concern is that transplant rejection would be most pronounced at sites of previous lesions, exacerbating a hyperactive immune response which could prevent remyelination and precipitate additional demyelination. Routine systemic immunosuppression may not be sufficient to prevent transplant rejection-associated immune reactions in the cerebral microenvironment. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), due to their homing properties and inherent immunosuppressive nature, are a promising tool for clinical application targeted toward immunosuppression at sites of injury. In this study, we used a co-transplantation strategy to investigate the effect of syngeneic MSCs on the survival and remyelination abilities of allogeneic OPCs in adult nonimmunosuppressed shiverer mice. At all time points examined, cotransplantation with MSCs increased OPC engraftment, migration, and maturation in myelinating oligodendrocytes, which produced widespread myelination in the host corpus callosum. In addition, MSCs reduced microglia activation and astrocytosis in the brain of transplanted animals as well as T-cell proliferation in vitro. These data suggest that combining the immunomodulatory and trophic properties of MSCs with the myelinating ability of OPCs might be a suitable strategy for promoting neurological regeneration in demyelinating diseases. © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.</p>"

Setting: Tertiary medical center in Hong Kong. Patients: Thirty-four Hong Kong Chinese patients with NMOSDs of 2 years or longer were recruited. Interventions: Brain and spinal cord magnetic resonance imaging was performed duringNMOSDattacks and was repeated yearly for the first 3 years. Main Outcome Measures: We evaluated clinical features of NMOSDs associated with brain involvement and brain lesions on magnetic resonance imaging. Results: Among 34 patients with NMOSDs of 2 years or longer, 20 (59%) had brain involvement. The mean age at onset among these 20 patients was 45.6 years (age range, 19-67 years); 18 were women. Eleven patients (32% of all the patients with NMOSDs) had clinical manifestation of brain involvement, 19 patients (56%) had brain abnormalities on magnetic resonance imaging consistent with inflammatory demyelination, and 2 patients (6%) fulfilled criteria for multiple sclerosis. Clinical manifestation of brain involvement included the following: trigeminal neuralgia; vomiting, vertigo, ataxia, dysphagia, and tetraparesis from lesions around the third and fourth ventricles and aqueduct; homonymous hemianopia, aphasia, hemiparesis, and cognitive impairment from extensive hemispheric white matter lesions; and ataxia, diplopia, hiccups, facial sensory loss, internuclear ophthalmoplegia, hemisensory loss, and hemiparesis from other lesions in the midbrain, pons, cerebellar peduncles, and medulla. Eight patients (24%) developed brainstem encephalitis clinically, and brainstem encephalitis was the initial clinical manifestation in 6 patients (18%).

The purpose of this study was to investigate changes in the brain's microstructure in multiple sclerosis (MS) after facilitation physiotherapy. Methods: Eleven patients with MS were examined using motor and neuropsychological testing and multimodal MRI at the beginning of the study, with second baseline measurement after 1 month without any therapy, and after a 2-month period of facilitation physiotherapy. Eleven healthy controls were examined at the beginning of the study and after 1 month. Fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (λ <sub>ax</sub>), and radial diffusivity (λ <sub>rad</sub>) were calculated for the whole corpus callosum (CC) in the midsagittal slice of T1W 3D MPRAGE spatially normalized images. Data were analyzed using linear mixed-effect models, paired, and two-sample tests. Results: At the baseline, patients with MS showed significantly lower values in FA (p &lt; 0.001), and significantly higher values in MD (p &lt; 0.001), λ <sub>ax</sub> (p = 0.003), and λ <sub>rad</sub> (p &lt; 0.001) compared to control subjects. The FA, MD, λ <sub>ax</sub>, and λ <sub>rad</sub> did not change between the first and second baseline examinations in either group.

In MS patients, FA in the CC significantly increased (p &lt; 0.001), MD and λ <sub>rad</sub> significantly decreased (p = 0.014 and p = 0.002), and thus approached the values in healthy controls.

There are a lot of reports regarding the coincidence of MS with other immune-mediated diseases. In recent years, there have been only few case reports of MS associated with Hashimoto's thyroiditis. This coincidence is especially important from both clinical and therapeutic standpoints.

1011,2-s2.0-80052366139,Diffusion tensor imaging and cognitive speed in children with multiple sclerosis,"<p>Objectives: To compare white matter (WM) integrity in children with MS and healthy children using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and correlate DTI findings with disease activity, lesion burden, and cognitive processing speed. Methods: Fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) in normal-appearing white matter (NAWM) were measured in four corpus callosum (CC), eight hemispheric regions, and the normal-appearing thalamus of 33 children and adolescents with MS and 30 age-matched healthy controls. Images were acquired on a GE LX 1.5 T scanner. DTI parameters used were 25 directions, b = 1000 s/mm <sup>2</sup>, and 5 mm slice thickness. MS patients had T2 lesion volumes and Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) scores were measured; all participants underwent two speeded cognitive tasks (Visual Matching and Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT)). Results: MS participants displayed lower FA values in the genu (p &lt; 0.005), splenium (p &lt; 0.001) and in NAWM of bilateral parietal, temporal, and occipital lobes (p &lt; 0.001) versus controls. FA and MD in the thalamus did not differ between groups. Higher lesion volumes correlated with reduced FA in CC and hemispheric NAWM. DTI metrics did not correlate with EDSS. FA values in CC regions correlated with Visual Matching (p &lt; 0.001) and SDMT (p &lt; 0.005) in MS participants only. Interpretation: DTI analyses indicate widespread NAWM disruption in children with MS-with the degree of abnormality correlating with impaired cognitive processing speed. These findings support an early onset tissue pathology in MS and illustrate its functional consequence. © 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.</p>"

It is known that in adults neural progenitors situated in the subventricular zone of the lateral ventricle (SVZ) are capable of generating OPs which can migrate into white matter tracts such as the corpus callosum (CC). We observed that progenitor cells in the SVZ of adult mice expressed CXCR4 chemokine receptors and that the chemokine SDF-1/CXCL12 was expressed in the CC. We therefore investigated the role of chemokine signaling in regulating the migration of OPs into the CC following their transplantation into the lateral ventricle. We established OP cell cultures from Olig2-EGFP mouse brains. These cells expressed a variety of chemokine receptors, including CXCR4 receptors. Olig2-EGFP OPs differentiated into CNPase-expressing oligodendrocytes in culture. To study the migratory capacity of Olig2-EGFP OPs in vivo, we transplanted them into the lateral ventricles of mice. Donor cells migrated into the CC and differentiated into mature oligodendrocytes. This migration was enhanced in animals with Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis (EAE). Inhibition of CXCR4 receptor expression in OPs using shRNA inhibited the migration of transplanted OPs into the white matter suggesting that their directed migration is regulated by CXCR4 signaling. These findings indicate that CXCR4 mediated signaling is important in guiding the migration of transplanted OPs in the context of inflammatory demyelinating brain disease. © 2011.</p>"
1013,2-s2.0-79957989550,How does the corpus callosum mediate interhemispheric transfer? A review,"<p>The corpus callosum is the largest white matter structure in the human brain, connecting cortical regions of both hemispheres. Complete and partial callosotomies or callosal lesion studies have granted more insight into the function of the corpus callosum, namely the facilitation of communication between the cerebral hemispheres. How the corpus callosum mediates this information transfer is still a topic of debate. Some pose that the corpus callosum maintains independent processing between the two hemispheres, whereas others say that the corpus callosum shares information between hemispheres. These theories of inhibition and excitation are further explored by reviewing recent behavioural studies and morphological findings to gain more information about callosal function. Additional information regarding callosal function in relation to altered morphology and dysfunction in disorders is reviewed to add to the discussion of callosal involvement in interhemispheric transfer. Both the excitatory and inhibitory theories seem likely candidates to describe callosal function, however evidence also exists for both functions within the same corpus callosum. For future research it would be beneficial to investigate the functional role of the callosal sub regions to get a better understanding of function and use more appropriate experimental methods to determine functional connectivity when looking at interhemispheric transfer. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.</p>"
1014,2-s2.0-80051786752,Regional brain atrophy in children with multiple sclerosis,"<p>We used cross-sectional tensor-based morphometry to visualize reduced volume in the whole brains of pediatric patients with multiple sclerosis, relative to healthy controls. As a marker of local volume difference, we used the Jacobian determinant of the deformation field that maps each subject to a standard space. To properly assess abnormal differences in volume in this age group, it is necessary to account for the normal, age-related differences in brain volume. This was accomplished by computing normalized z-score Jacobian determinant values at each voxel to represent the local volume difference (in standard deviations) between an individual subject and an age- and sex-matched healthy normal population. Compared with healthy controls, pediatric patients with multiple sclerosis exhibited significantly reduced volumes within the thalamus and the splenium of the corpus callosum and significant expansions in the ventricles. While T2-weighted lesion volume was correlated with reduced splenium volume, no correlation was found between T2-weighted lesion volume and reduced thalamic volume. Reduced volumes of the optic pathways, including that of the optic tracts and optic radiations, correlated with disease duration. Our results suggest that focal inflammatory lesions may play an important role in tract degeneration, including transsynaptic degeneration. © 2011.</p>"

Several adverse events, including neurological episodes have been reported. Relation to treatment is a major concern and guidelines for management of those patients are not available. Observation: A 35-year-old patient was treated with etanercept for psoriasic rheumatism. She had previously been treated with corticosteroids, methotrexate, hydroxychloroquin, and leflunomide. Four months after ATA initiation, she presented with left optic neuritis. Brain MRI showed white matter hyperintensities involving periventricular, juxtacortical areas and corpus callosum. ATA treatment was stopped. CSF study revealed increased immunoglobulin index and presence of oligoclonal bands. Six months later, she presented with myelitis and developed clinically definite MS. Discussion: Neurological adverse events under ATA include demyelinating events, peripheral neuropathy and vasculitis of the central nervous system. Few data are available in the literature regarding demyelinating events. In such cases, MRI sometimes reveals white matter intensities fulfilling criteria for demyelinating diseases, but sometimes shows non-specific abnormalities. The predictive value of MRI and CSF study for further development of MS has not been studied. Neurological adverse events are a major concern for physicians and often require discontinuation of therapy. Guidelines for management of such episodes would be useful. © 2011 Publié par Elsevier Masson SAS.</p>"
1016,2-s2.0-80052636021,A coincidental case of young-onset parkinson disease and multiple sclerosis,"<p>Background: Parkinsonism in patients with multiple sclerosis is rare. Some patients have 2 coincidental diseases, whereas others have a Parkinsonian syndrome symptomatic to demyelinating lesions. Case Report: We describe a 42-year-old female patient who developed left akinetic-rigid Parkinsonian syndrome at the age of 38 years. Brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed multiple white matter hyperintense T2-weighted lesions. DaTSCAN revealed reduced uptake of dopamine transporter in the right striatum. Intravenous corticosteroids were inefficacious. She had major clinical improvement with levodopa and 6 months later developed peak-dose dyskinesias. At the age of 41 years, she presented with a brainstem attack, with complete symptom resolution after intravenous corticosteroids. Subsequent brain magnetic resonance imagings disclosed new inflammatory lesions. Immunomodulatory treatment was started with β-interferon. COMMENTS: In this patient, the presence of an asymmetrical Parkinsonian syndrome, with good response to levodopa, peak-dose dyskinesias, and abnormal DaTSCAN, supports the diagnosis of young-onset Parkinson disease. The multiple sclerosis diagnosis was established based on clinical evidence of time and space dissemination of demyelinating lesions. © 2011 by Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins.</p>"

It is particularly difficult to distinguish between ADEM and an initial attack of multiple sclerosis (MS) clinically and based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or cerebrospinal fluid. ADEM is quite rare after malaria infection. Our patient, although diagnosed provisionally of ADEM after mixed malaria infection, had neuroimaging closely simulating MS. CASE REPORT: We report a case of a woman with an adult type 2 diabetes presenting with fever and diagnosed by antigen assay to be suffering from mixed malaria infection (Plasmodium falciparum, Plasmodium vivax). While recovering with artesunate and doxycycline therapy, she developed acute onset bladder retention followed by paraparesis. On examination she had evidence of Upper Motor Neuron (UMN) signs in all the 4 limbs along with truncal sensory loss. Discussion: Her MRI of spine showed T2 hyperintensities suggestive of resolving myelitis. MRI of the brain showed multifocal and confluent areas of demyelination mostly involving the corpus callosum and periventricular region. Lesions, particularly the callosal ones, closely simulated MS. In accordance with the McDonald Criteria and Barkhofs MRI Criteria, this patient did not fit into the diagnosis of MS. Our provisional diagnosis was ADEM. © 2011 by Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins.</p>"
1018,2-s2.0-80052161486,Matrix metalloproteinases and their tissue inhibitors in cuprizone-induced demyelination and remyelination of brain white and gray matter,"<p>Apart from their involvement in the pathogenesis of demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis, there is emerging evidence that matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) also promote remyelination. We investigated region-specific expression patterns of 11 MMPs and 4 tissueinhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) in the cuprizone murine demyelination model. Messenger RNA (mRNA) was extracted at different time points of exposure to cuprizone from microdissected samples of corpus callosum, cortex, and ex vivo isolated microglia and analyzedusing quantitative reverse transcription- polymerase chain reaction.Matrix metalloproteinase 12 and TIMP-1 mRNA were significantly upregulated versus age-matched controls in both areas during demyelination and remyelination. Matrix metalloproteinases 3, 11, and 14 mRNA were upregulated only in white matter during remyelination. Matrix metalloproteinase 24 mRNA was downregulated during both demyelination and remyelination. To identify potential cellular sources of the MMPs and TIMPs, we isolated microglia and detected high MMP-12and TIMP-2 mRNA upregulation at the peak of demyelination.By immunohistochemistry, MMP-3 protein was localized in astrocytes and MMP-12 was identified in microglia, astrocytes, and cells of oligodendrocyte lineage. These findings suggest that MMPs and TIMPs have roles in the regulation of demyelination and remyelination in thismodel. Moreover, differences in the expression levels of these genesbetween white and gray matter reveal region-specific molecularmechanisms. © 2011 by the American Association of Neuropathologists, Inc.</p>"
1019,2-s2.0-80051475230,Sex steroids and connectivity in the human brain: A review of neuroimaging studies,"<p>Our brain operates by the way of interconnected networks. Connections between brain regions have been extensively studied at a functional and structural level, and impaired connectivity has been postulated as an important pathophysiological mechanism underlying several neuropsychiatric disorders. Yet the neurobiological mechanisms contributing to the development of functional and structural brain connections remain to be poorly understood. Interestingly, animal research has convincingly shown that sex steroid hormones (estrogens, progesterone and testosterone) are critically involved in myelination, forming the basis of white matter connectivity in the central nervous system. To get insights, we reviewed studies into the relation between sex steroid hormones, white matter and functional connectivity in the human brain, measured with neuroimaging. Results suggest that sex hormones organize structural connections, and activate the brain areas they connect. These processes could underlie a better integration of structural and functional communication between brain regions with age. Specifically, ovarian hormones (estradiol and progesterone) may enhance both cortico-cortical and subcortico-cortical functional connectivity, whereas androgens (testosterone) may decrease subcortico-cortical functional connectivity but increase functional connectivity between subcortical brain areas. Therefore, when examining healthy brain development and aging or when investigating possible biological mechanisms of 'brain connectivity' diseases, the contribution of sex steroids should not be ignored. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.</p>"
1020,2-s2.0-80051789332,The hippocampal fimbria of cuprizone-treated animals as a structure for studying neuroprotection in multiple sclerosis,"<p>Objective and design: It has been demonstrated that changes in the normal-appearing white matter (NAWM) in multiple sclerosis precede the appearance of classical lesions. The understanding of NAWM biology in an established disease model might help to clarify why some of them progress to active demyelinating lesions. Material or subjects: C57BL6 male mice (19-21 g) were used in this study. Treatment: Demyelination was induced by feeding mice a diet containing 0.2% cuprizone for up to 5 weeks. Methods: Routine stainings (luxol fast blue, and hematoxylin and eosin) and immunohistochemistry were performed to assess myelin status and the inflammatory infiltrate. Results: We demonstrated that, in the toxic demyelination cuprizone model, the corpus callosum is severely demyelinated after a 5-week cuprizone challenge (acute demyelination) whereas the fimbria of the hippocampus appear normal in routine myelin stainings. Microgliosis but not astrogliosis is evident after acute demyelination in the fimbria. Interestingly, both regions, the fimbria and the corpus callosum, demonstrated early oligodendrocyte apoptosis as well as intense microglia accumulation and activation. However, only the corpus callosum progresses to actively demyelination lesions whereas the fimbria does not. Conclusions: The applied model appears suitable for elucidating pathways which promote progression of affected tissue to an active lesion. © 2011 The Author(s).</p>"
1021,2-s2.0-79960764346,Axin2 as regulatory and therapeutic target in newborn brain injury and remyelination,"<p>Permanent damage to white matter tracts, comprising axons and myelinating oligodendrocytes, is an important component of brain injuries of the newborn that cause cerebral palsy and cognitive disabilities, as well as multiple sclerosis in adults. However, regulatory factors relevant in human developmental myelin disorders and in myelin regeneration are unclear. We found that AXIN2 was expressed in immature oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OLPs) in white matter lesions of human newborns with neonatal hypoxic-ischemic and gliotic brain damage, as well as in active multiple sclerosis lesions in adults. Axin2 is a target of Wnt transcriptional activation that negatively feeds back on the pathway, promoting Î 2-catenin degradation. We found that Axin2 function was essential for normal kinetics of remyelination. The small molecule inhibitor XAV939, which targets the enzymatic activity of tankyrase, acted to stabilize Axin2 levels in OLPs from brain and spinal cord and accelerated their differentiation and myelination after hypoxic and demyelinating injury. Together, these findings indicate that Axin2 is an essential regulator of remyelination and that it might serve as a pharmacological checkpoint in this process. © 2011 Nature America, Inc.

1022,2-s2.0-79958707274,Impairment in explicit visuomotor sequence learning is related to loss of microstructural integrity of the corpus callosum in multiple sclerosis patients with minimal disability,"<p>Sequence learning can be investigated by serial reaction-time (SRT) paradigms. Explicit learning occurs when subjects have to recognize a test sequence and has been shown to activate the frontoparietal network in both contralateral and ipsilateral hemispheres. Thus, the left and right superior longitudinal fasciculi (SLF), connecting the intra-hemispheric frontoparietal circuits, could have a role in explicit unimanual visuomotor learning. Also, as both hemispheres are involved, we could hypothesize that the corpus callosum (CC) has a role in this process. Pathological damage in both SLF and CC has been detected in patients with Multiple Sclerosis (PwMS), and microstructural alterations can be quantified by Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI).In light of these findings, we inquired whether PwMS with minimal disability showed impairments in explicit visuomotor sequence learning and whether this could be due to loss of white matter integrity in these intra- and inter-hemispheric white matter pathways. Thus, we combined DTI analysis with a modified version of SRT task based on finger opposition movements in a group of PwMS with minimal disability.We found that the performance in explicit sequence learning was significantly reduced in these patients with respect to healthy subjects; the amount of sequence-specific learning was found to be more strongly correlated with fractional anisotropy (FA) in the CC (r. =0.93) than in the left (r. =0.28) and right SLF (r. =0.27) (p for interaction. =0.005 and 0.04 respectively). This finding suggests that an inter-hemispheric information exchange between the homologous areas is required to successfully accomplish the task and indirectly supports the role of the right (ipsilateral) hemisphere in explicit visuomotor learning. On the other hand, we found no significant correlation of the FA in the CC and in the SLFs with nonspecific learning (assessed when stimuli are randomly presented), supporting the hypothesis that inter-hemispheric integrity is specifically relevant for explicit sequence learning. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.</p>"

Methods: All 20 cases of ADEM and 24 cases of CMS were examined. Their epidemiological and clinical findings, laboratory features and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data were analyzed using χ <sup>2</sup> test for categorical variables, Wilcoxon Rank-Sum tests for continuous variables. Results: ADEM and CMS showed no sex predominance. Patients with ADEM ((27±15) years) were younger than CMS ((37±13) years, Z=-2.218, P=0.027). The following findings were more commonly seen in ADEM compared with CMS: predemyelinating infectious disease (75% vs 4%, χ <sup>2</sup>=23.652, P=0.000), fever (65% vs 4%, χ <sup>2</sup>=18.609, P=0.000), meningeal irritation sign (40% vs 0, χ <sup>2</sup>=9.189, P=0.002), seizure (25% vs 0, χ <sup>2</sup>=4.514, P=0.034), and encephalopathy. ADEM patients were more likely to present with blood leucocytosis ((11.9±5.8)×10 <sup>9</sup>/L vs (8.0±3.2)×10 <sup>9</sup>/L, Z=-2.030, P=0.042), high C-reactive protein (2.74 mg/L vs 0.49 mg/L, Z=-3.028, P=0.002), increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate (11.00 mm/h vs 7.00 mm/h, Z=-2. 406, P=0.016), and cerebrospinal fluid leucocytosis (9×10 <sup>6</sup>/L vs 2×10 <sup>6</sup>/L, Z=-2.781, P=0.005). There were no differences in cerebrospinal fluid protein and oligoclonal band between the two groups. The following MRI lesions were more commonly seen in ADEM patients: cortical gray matter lesions (14/20, χ <sup>2</sup>=15.213, P=0.000), basal ganglia gray matter lesions (14/20, χ <sup>2</sup>=8.910, P=0.003), and brainstem lesions (14/20, χ <sup>2</sup>=5. 867, P=0.015). In contrast, lesions in subcortical white matter (21/24, χ <sup>2</sup>=17.628, P=0.000), periventricular area (21/24, χ <sup>2</sup>=15.213, P=0.000) and corpus callosum (14/24, χ <sup>2</sup>=8.640, P=0.003) were more common in the MRI image of CMS patients. The lesions in spinal cord were usually centrally distributed in ADEM (83%), while peripherally in CMS (85%, χ <sup>2</sup>=11.542, P=0.001). The lesions had poorly defined margins in ADEM (95%), but well defined margins in CMS (75%, χ <sup>2</sup>=21.787, P=0.000).

1024,2-s2.0-79959792397,Perception-based visualization of manifold-valued medical images using distance-preserving dimensionality reduction,"<p>A method for visualizing manifold-valued medical image data is proposed. The method operates on images in which each pixel is assumed to be sampled from an underlying manifold. For example, each pixel may contain a high dimensional vector, such as the time activity curve (TAC) in a dynamic positron emission tomography (dPET) or a dynamic single photon emission computed tomography (dSPECT) image, or the positive semi-definite tensor in a diffusion tensor magnetic resonance image (DTMRI). A nonlinear mapping reduces the dimensionality of the pixel data to achieve two goals: distance preservation and embedding into a perceptual color space. We use multidimensional scaling distance-preserving mapping to render similar pixels (e.g., DT or TAC pixels) with perceptually similar colors. The 3D CIELAB perceptual color space is adopted as the range of the distance preserving mapping, with a final similarity transform mapping colors to a maximum gamut size. Similarity between pixels is either determined analytically as geodesics on the manifold of pixels or is approximated using manifold learning techniques. In particular, dissimilarity between DTMRI pixels is evaluated via a Log-Euclidean Riemannian metric respecting the manifold of the rank 3, second-order positive semi-definite DTs, whereas the dissimilarity between TACs is approximated via ISOMAP. We demonstrate our approach via artificial high-dimensional, manifold-valued data, as well as case studies of normal and pathological clinical brain and heart DTMRI, dPET, and dSPECT images. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in capturing, in a perceptually meaningful way, important features in the data. © 2011 IEEE.</p>"
1025,2-s2.0-79959261966,Corticosteroids Impair Remyelination in the Corpus Callosum of Cuprizone-Treated Mice,"<p>Corticosteroids (CS) are effective in the treatment of many brain disorders, such as multiple sclerosis (MS) or traumatic brain injury. This has been scrutinised in different experimental animal models. However, neither the mechanisms, nor the site of CS action are fully understood. Short-term high-dose CS treatment improves MS symptoms and severity of clinical disability during an acute inflammatory exacerbation of disease. In the present study, we analysed the influence of CS on the expression of cellular and molecular markers of spontaneous endogenous remyelination in the toxic non-immune cuprizone animal model at early (9days) and intermediate (21days) remyelination, as well as steroidal effects in primary astrocytes and oligodendrocyte progenitor cultures. Dexamethasone (Dex) and methylprednisolone (MP) induced a higher expression of the differentiation markers myelin basic protein and proteolipid protein (PLP) in cultured oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPC). CS exposure of primary cultured astrocytes resulted in a greater expression of those genes involved in OPC proliferation [fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-αα] and a reduced expression of the pro-maturation factor insulin-like growth factor 1. Pro-maturating effects of CS were completely blocked by FGF2 and PDGF-αα co-application in OPC cultures. MP treatment in vivo resulted in a reduced recovery of PLP-staining intensity, whereas the re-population of the demyelinated corpus callosum with adenomatous polyposis coli-expressing oligodendrocytes was not affected. The numbers of brain intrinsic inflammatory cells, microglia and astrocytes during remyelination were similar in placebo and MP-treated animals. Our findings suggest that treatment with CS might have, in addition to the well-known benefical effects on inflammatory processes, a negative influence on remyelination. © 2011 The Authors.

Material and methods: Twenty-eight patients with RRMS and 28 age-matched healthy volunteers underwent a diffusion tensor MR imaging study. Quantitative deterministic and probabilistic fiber tractography were generated in all subjects. And mean numbers of tracked lines and fiber density were counted. Paired-samples t tests were used to compare tracked lines and fiber density in RRMS patients with those in controls. Bivariate linear regression model was used to determine the relationship between quantitative fiber tractography and EDSS in RRMS. Results: Both deterministic and probabilistic tractography's tracked lines and fiber density in RRMS patients were less than those in controls (P &lt; .001). Both deterministic and probabilistic tractography's tracked lines and fiber density were found negative correlations with EDSS in RRMS (P &lt; .001). The fiber tract disruptions and reductions in RRMS were directly visualized on fiber tractography. Conclusion: Changes of white matter tracts can be detected by quantitative diffusion tensor fiber tractography, and correlate with clinical impairment in RRMS. © 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

1027,2-s2.0-79957670752,"Inhibition of 5-lipoxygenase activity in mice during cuprizone-induced demyelination attenuates neuroinflammation, motor dysfunction and axonal damage","<p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS). Increased expression of 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO), a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of leukotrienes (LTs), has been reported in MS lesions and LT levels are elevated in the cerebrospinal fluid of MS patients. To determine whether pharmacological inhibition of 5-LO attenuates demyelination, MK886, a 5-LO inhibitor, was given to mice fed with cuprizone. Gene and protein expression of 5-LO were increased at the peak of cuprizone-induced demyelination. Although MK886 did not attenuate cuprizone-induced demyelination in the corpus callosum or in the cortex, it attenuated cuprizone-induced axonal damage and motor deficits and reduced microglial activation and IL-6 production. These data suggest that during cuprizone-induced demyelination, the 5-LO pathway contributes to microglial activation and neuroinflammation and to axonal damage resulting in motor dysfunction. Thus, 5-LO inhibition may be a useful therapeutic treatment in demyelinating diseases of the CNS. © 2011.</p>"

MRI plays an important role in diagnosing and monitoring patients with MS; however, current conventional MRI is limited in detecting lesions such as cortical-based plaques. Structural MRI may also be insufficient to explain all neurological presentations in patients with MS, particularly cognitive symptoms. Advanced MRI techniques such as diffusion-weighted imaging, diffusion tensor imaging, functional MRI, magnetization transfer, magnetic resonance (MR) perfusion imaging and MR spectroscopy facilitate a greater understanding of the underlying pathophysiology of MS.

1030,2-s2.0-79955715345,Motor callosal disconnection in early relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis,"<p>In relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) the corpus callosum (CC) is often and early affected by macroscopic lesions when investigated by conventional MRI. We sought to determine to which extent microstructural and effective disconnection of the CC are already present in RRMS patients at the earliest stages of the disease prior to evidence of macroscopic CC lesion. We compared 16 very early RRMS patients (median expanded disability status scale (EDSS), 1.5; range, 0-2.0) to an age-matched group of healthy controls and focused analysis to the motor CC, i.e. that part of the CC relaying interhemispheric motor information. A combined functional magnetic resonance imaging/diffusion tensor imaging fiber-tracking procedure was applied to identify the callosal motor fibers (CMFs) connecting the hand areas of the primary motor cortices of the two hemispheres. Fractional anisotropy (FA) within the motor CC (FA-CC) assessed the CMF microstructural integrity. Bifocal paired transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) tested short-interval interhemispheric inhibition (S-IHI), an established measure of CMF effective connectivity. FA-CC and S-IHI were significantly reduced in early RRMS compared to healthy controls. Furthermore, a significant linear correlation between microstructure (FA-CC) and function (S-IHI) in the controls was broken down in the patients. These abnormalities were obtained in the absence of macroscopic CMF lesion in conventional MRI, and whilst motor hand/arm function in the nine-hole-peg test and corticospinal conduction time were normal. Findings suggest that reductions in FA and S-IHI may serve as surrogate markers of motor callosal disconnection at the earliest stages of RRMS prior to development of macroscopic lesion. © 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.</p>"
1031,2-s2.0-79954606776,Differentiation of induced pluripotent stem cells into functional oligodendrocytes,"<p>The technology to generate autologous pluripotent stem cells (iPS cells) from almost any somatic cell type has brought various cell replacement therapies within clinical research. Besides the challenge to optimize iPS protocols to appropriate safety and GMP levels, procedures need to be developed to differentiate iPS cells into specific fully differentiated and functional cell types for implantation purposes. In this article, we describe a protocol to differentiate mouse iPS cells into oligodendrocytes with the aim to investigate the feasibility of IPS stem cell-based therapy for demyelinating disorders, such as multiple sclerosis. Our protocol results in the generation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) that can develop into mature, myelinating oligodendrocytes in-vitro (co-culture with DRG neurons) as well as in-vivo (after implantation in the demyelinated corpus callosum of cuprizone-treated mice). We report the importance of complete purification of the iPS-derived OPC suspension to prevent the contamination with teratoma-forming iPS cells. © 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.</p>"

We sought to examine if NO plays centrally a key role in MS related phenomena; demyelination or neuroinflammation. Female Wistar rats (weighing 200-250 g) were mounted in a stereotaxic apparatus and received injections of l-arginine aimed at corpus callosum (AP: 1.2, L: ± 1.8, V: 3.2). The drug (50-200 μg/rat) was microinjected intra-corpus callosum repeatedly (3-5 times/each per day). Control groups solely received saline (1 μg/rat) into the corpus callosum. The animals were tested for the novelty seeking behavior using the conditioning task. Memory impairment was examined using the shuttle box and Y-maze. l-NAME was pre-injected to l-arginine to involve the NO. All animals' brains were also processed for histological evaluation. l-arginine produced significant changes in the novelty seeking behavior but not in the memory formation, evidenced by passive avoidance and alternation behaviors. Pre-injection of l-NAME reversed the response to l-arginine. Present study further revealed a prominent inflammation as well as myelin elimination in the l-arginine treated rats' brains. These data suggest that the NO infusion in the myelin rich areas such as corpus callosum may lead to MS signs centrally. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.</p>"

The goal of this study was to assess the potential impact of early neuronal dysfunction affecting white matter (WM), grey matter (GM), or the cerebellum on cognitive deterioration and/or EDSS progression during the first 5 years of MS. Magnetic resonance spectroscopic (MRS) examinations and neuropsychological assessments were performed in 23 patients included after the first clinical attack of MS and 24 healthy controls. The same protocol was performed in patients after a follow-up of 5 years. Metabolic neuronal function was assessed in WM (splenium of corpus callosum), GM (dorsal posterior cingulate cortex), and the cerebellum by evaluating N-acetylaspartate (NAA) levels. During followup, 39% of patients showed cognitive deterioration and 43% showed a deterioration in their EDSS. Patients with cognitive deterioration had greater NAA level reductions during follow-up in the cerebellum (p = 0.003) and WM (p = 0.02) compared to patients without cognitive deterioration. In addition, patients with cognitive deterioration had higher progression of T2 lesion load (T2LL) during the follow-up period compared to patients without cognitive deterioration (p = 0.03). No differences between patients with and without EDSS progression in terms of NAA levels or T2LL were observed. The present longitudinal study found evidence that, during the first 5 years of MS, cognitive deterioration is associated with the progression of neuronal dysfunction and tissue injury as assessed by MRS and T2LL, respectively. © Springer-Verlag 2010.</p>"
1034,2-s2.0-79956076480,Voxelwise assessment of the regional distribution of damage in the brains of patients with multiple sclerosis and fatigue,"<p>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Fatigue affects up to 90% of patients with MS. We assessed the regional distribution of lesions and atrophy of the normal-appearing WM and GM in patients with RRMS with fatigue compared with HC and patients with similar characteristics, but without fatigue. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From 14 patients with RRMS without fatigue, 10 with RRMS with fatigue, and 14 HC, we acquired brain dual-echo and high-resolution T1-weighted scans. Voxel-wise distributions of GM, WM damage, and T2 lesions were compared between patients with fatigued and nonfatigued MS by using SPM5 software. We report results at P &lt; .05, FWE corrected. RESULTS: T2 lesion distribution and regional WM atrophy did not differ between patients with fatigued and nonfatigued MS. Compared with HC, patients with MS had significant WM atrophy in the posterior part of the corpus callosum and significant GM atrophy of the left superior frontal sulcus, left precentral gyrus, posterior cingulate cortex, right thalamus, and left middle frontal gyrus. No additional areas of atrophy were found in patients with nonfatigued MS compared with HC, whereas patients with fatigued MS also had atrophy of the left central sulcus. Atrophy in the left central sulcus and the precentral gyrus was more severe in patients with fatigued versus nonfatigued MS. In patients with MS, significant correlations were found between fatigue severity and GM atrophy in the left precentral gyrus (r = -0.73, P &lt; .0001 uncorrected). CONCLUSIONS: Atrophy of the primary sensorimotor area is likely to contribute to MS-related fatigue. Copyright © 2011 by the American Society of Neuroradiology.</p>"
1035,2-s2.0-79955768163,MRI Correlates of Cognitive Impairment in Childhood-Onset Multiple Sclerosis,"<p>Objective: Brain MRI measures were correlated with neuropsychological function in 35 pediatric-onset multiple sclerosis (MS) patients and 33 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. Method: Mean age of MS patients was 16.3 ± 2.3 years with average disease duration of 4.3 ± 3.1 years. Cortical gray matter, thalamic, and global brain volumes were calculated for all participants using a scaling factor computed using normalization of atrophy method to normalize total and regional brain volumes for head size. T1- and T2-weighted lesion volumes were calculated for MS patients. Results: Cognitive impairment (CI) was identified in 29% of the MS cohort. Cognitive deficits predominantly involved attention and processing speed, expressive language, and visuomotor integration. Relative to controls, the MS group showed significantly lower thalamic volume (p &lt; .001), total brain volume (p &lt; .008), and gray matter volume (p &lt; .015). Corpus callosum area and thalamic volume differentiated patients identified as having CI from those without CI (p &lt; .05). Regression models controlling for disease duration and age indicated that thalamic volume accounted for significant incremental variance in predicting global IQ, processing speed, and expressive vocabulary (Δ R2 ranging from .43 to .60) and was the most robust MRI predictor of cognition relative to other MRI metrics. Conclusions: The robust association between cognitive function and reduced size of thalamus and global brain volume in pediatric-onset MS patients implicate neurodegenerative processes early in the disease course, and suggest that plasticity of an immature central nervous system is not sufficient to protect patients from the deleterious consequences of MS on cognitive neural networks. © 2011 American Psychological Association.</p>"

Neurology 76(2), 179-186 (2011). This article reviews the study by Harrison et al., who assessed the feasibility of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and magnetization transfer (MT) ratio measures as surrogates of longitudinal changes in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients in order to integrate them into clinical trials. A total of 78 patients with MS underwent a magnetic resonance examination at baseline, 3 months, 6 months and 1 year, and yearly thereafter. The magnetic resonance sequences were DTI, MT, proton density/T2-weighted, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery and T1-3D sequence (MPRAGE). The indices with the highest longitudinal variation were the supratentorial qT2 (percentage change per year = +2.0), supratentorial fractional anisotropy (percentage change per year = -0.5) and corpus callosum fractional anisotropy (percentage change per year = -1.7); MT ratio yielded measurable longitudinal changes in all of the areas studied, although at a slower rate than those yielded by DTI. With 80% power, the number of participants (per trial arm) needed for a 12- or 24-month trial were calculated using each of the MRI indices as outcome measures. The DTI indices were those that provided the smaller, more convenient numbers. Further studies are required to assess these proposed MRI parameters, and these studies will need to analyze both a more homogeneous MS population and MS patients in an early disease phase who have undergone no treatment. © 2011 Future Medicine Ltd.</p>"

The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of S1P receptors in a non-T-cell model of demyelination, the cuprizone (cupr) model in C57BL/6 mice. Treatment with FTY720 (1 mg/kg) led to attenuated injury to OLGs, myelin, and axons in the corpus callosum (percentage of myelinated fibers was 44.7% in cupr-water and 63% in cupr-FTY720). Reactive astrogliosis and microgliosis were ameliorated when FTY720 was given from d 1, but astrogliosis was augmented when FTY720 was given from wk 4-9. FTY720 did not promote remyelination in this model. The protective effect of FTY720 was associated with decreased interleukin-1β and CCL2 transcripts in the corpus callosum, as well as altered S1P1 expression. Targeted deletion of S1P1 in OLG lineage cells did not lead to obvious clinical phenotype, but resulted in subtle abnormalities in myelin and an increased susceptibility to cupr-induced demyelination. We conclude that S1P receptors expressed by neuroglia are involved in regulating the response to injury, and CNS effects of FTY720 could contribute to its favorable therapeutic response in multiple sclerosis. © FASEB.</p>"
1038,2-s2.0-79954571953,An animal model of cortical and callosal pathology in multiple sclerosis,"<p>The pathological and radiological hallmarks of multiple sclerosis (MS) include multiple demyelinated lesions disseminated throughout the white matter of the central nervous system (CNS). More recently, the cerebral cortex has been shown to be affected in MS, but the elucidation of events causing cortical demyelination has been hampered by the lack of animal models reflecting such human cortical pathology. In this report, we have described the presence of cortical gray matter and callosal white matter demyelinating lesions in the chronic experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mouse model of MS. Similar to the pathological lesions of MS patients, EAE lesions have been classified as type I-leukocortical, type II-intracortical and type III-subpial. All of these lesions had varying degrees of demyelination, inflammatory cells and reactive astrocytes. Similar to MS, cortical layers during EAE showed demyelination, microglia activation, synaptic protein alterations and apoptotic cells. In addition, the callosal white matter during EAE had many inflammatory demyelinating lesions and axon degeneration. Functional electrophysiological conduction analysis showed deficits in both myelinated and unmyelinated callosal axons during early and late EAE. The chronic EAE mouse model has features that mimic cortical and callosal pathology of MS, and can be potentially used to screen agents to prevent these features of disease. © 2010 The Authors; Brain Pathology.</p>"

Neurofibromatosis type I associated multiple sclerosis is a very rare condition. A 28-year old NF1 man developed progressive spastic-ataxic gait, left side dysmetria, right internuclear ophthalmoplegia, spastic dysarthria. MRI of the brain depicted Dawson finger appearance demyelination of the corpus callosum and other multifoci demyelinating lesions typical for MS. CSF revealed high CSF protein with negative oligoclonal band. Visual evoked potential showed prolonged P100 latency, abnormal wave form and temporal dispersion bilaterally. The syndrome partially responded and stabilized with corticosteroid. Six months later, progression of the syndrome characterized by paraparesis, bilateral cerebellar hemispheric syndrome and bilateral internuclear ophthalmoplegia occurred. Repeated MRI revealed more extensive white matter lesions extended into centrum semiovale. The progressive syndrome did not respond to corticosteroid. Primary progressive multiple sclerosis was diagnosed. Only thirteen cases with NF1 and multiple sclerosis have been described in the literature. The association has been hypothesized to be related to mutations in the neurofibromin protein or oligodendrocytemyelin glycoprotein (OMgp) gene.</p>"

We investigated the relative contributions of diffuse white matter damage and focal lesions using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), in predicting future worsening of hand function in RRMS. The nine hole peg test (NHPT), a test of fine hand motor control, was used to measure baseline upper limb function in 16 controls and 25 RRMS patients, and then performed at follow-up on 22 of these patients at 6 and 12. months. Tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) were used across the whole brain as a non-hypothesis driven method for localizing white matter changes associated with motor deficits. Subsequently, we used probabilistic fiber tractography in the corticospinal tracts (CST) and the transcallosal hand motor (TCHM) fibers to assess the predictive power of diffusion metrics and/or functionally relevant visible lesion volumes on the decline of hand motor function over the next 12. months. While fractional anisotropy (FA) and radial diffusivity (RD) of both pathways were strongly associated with NHPT performance at baseline, only RD of the TCHM fibers was predictive of NHPT decline over the next 12. months. Neither total visible lesion load nor pathway specific lesion loads were indicative of NHPT performance or progression. The TCHM fibers may play an important role in modifying the effects of MS pathology on fine motor control, and RD in these fibers may be a sensitive biomarker for future disability. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.</p>"
1041,2-s2.0-79951508795,Brain abnormalities in neuromyelitis optica,"<p>Background: Differentiating neuromyelitis optica (NMO) from multiple sclerosis (MS) is a real challenge in the clinical field. In the past, NMO (not MS), was inferred when abnormality was not detected in the brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Recently, some studies have reported abnormalities in the brain MRIs of NMO, but only few among the Asian population. The aim of this study was to evaluate the frequency of brain MRI among Korean NMO patients and characterize findings that might be helpful to distinguish NMO from MS. Methods: Medical records, NMO-IgG, and brain MRI of 17 patients diagnosed with NMO by the revised diagnostic criteria of Wingerchuk et al. (2006) [6] from 2008 to 2010, were reviewed. Results: 11 out of 17 patients (64.7%) had abnormal MRI findings. More than two lesions were detected in most patients. The majority of patients with brain MRI abnormality showed nonspecific (5 patients) or atypical (6 patients) findings. Cerebral white matter was most frequently involved (58.8%). 3 patients (17.6%) involved corpus callosum, 4 (23.5%) with internal capsule, 2 (11.8%) with cerebellum, and 3 (17.6%) with brainstem. There were 5 (29.4%) patients who met the Paty et al. criteria (1988) [15] and 3 patients (35.3%) who met the multiple sclerosis (MS) spatial distribution diagnostic criteria of Barkhof et al. (1997) [14] in their brain MRI. Conclusions: Brain abnormalities have been frequently found among Korean NMO patients and the frequencies have been reported to be higher than that of Caucasians. Current MS spatial distribution criteria, such as Paty et al. (1988) [15] or Barkhof et al. (1997) [14], are not sufficient to discriminate NMO from MS in brain MRI findings.

In this study, we investigated its expression in an experimental multiple sclerosis animal model, the cuprizone mouse model which reveals massive myelin loss. Cuprizone intoxication for 5 weeks induced immense demyelination of the corpus callosum and resulted in hypertrophic and hyperplastic astrocytosis accompanied by microglia/macrophage invasion. Using double-immunofluorescence, real-time quantitative PCR and Western Blot, we observed that activated astrocytes are the main source of amyloid precursor protein during demyelination. In order to rule out astrocytes, in general, responding to inflammatory and toxic compounds by amyloid precursor protein expression, neonatal astroglia cultures were exposed to various stimuli. Under control conditions, astroglial amyloid precursor protein was only moderately expressed. None of the treatments had a significant effect on its expression in vitro. Our results suggest that amyloid precursor protein is specifically up-regulated under cuprizone-induced demyelination. It remains to be further elucidated whether amyloid precursor protein-positive astrocytes are directly implicated in the pathological mechanism of demyelination. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2010.</p>"

1044,2-s2.0-79951838515,Longitudinal near-infrared imaging of myelination,"<p>Myelination is one of the fundamental biological processes in the development of vertebrate nervous system. Disturbance of myelination is found to be associated with progression in many neurological diseases such as multiple sclerosis. Tremendous efforts have been made to develop novel therapeutic agents that prevent demyelination and/or promote remyelination. These efforts need to be accompanied by the development of imaging tools that permit direct quantification of myelination in vivo. In this work, we describe a novel near-infrared fluorescence imaging technique that is capable of direct quantification of myelination in vivo. This technique is developed based on a near-infrared fluorescent probe, 3,3′-diethylthiatricarbocyanine iodide (DBT) that readily enters the brain and specifically binds to myelinated fibers. In vivo imaging studies were first conducted in two animal models of hypermyelination and hypomyelination followed by longitudinal studies in the cuprizone-induced demyelination/remyelination mouse model. Quantitative analysis suggests that DBT is a sensitive and specific imaging probe of myelination, which complements other current myelin-imaging modalities and is of low cost.

1045,2-s2.0-79951525354,A myelin-specific contrast agent for magnetic resonance imaging of myelination,"<p>Myelination is one of the most fundamental biological processes in the development of vertebrate nervous systems. Abnormal or disrupted myelination occurs in many acquired or inherited neurodegenerative diseases, including multiple sclerosis (MS) and various leukodystrophies. To date, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been the primary tool for diagnosing and monitoring the progression of MS and related diseases; however, any change in signal intensity of conventional MRI reflects a change only in tissue water content, which is a nonspecific measure of the overall changes in macroscopic tissue injury. Thus, the use of MRI as a primary measure of disease activity was shown to be disassociated from the clinical outcome due to the lack of specificity for myelination. In order to increase the MRI specificity for myelin pathologies, we designed and synthesized the first Gd-based T <sub>1</sub> MR contrast agent (MIC) that binds to myelin with high specificity. In this Communication, we demonstrate that MIC localizes in brain regions in proportion to the extent of myelination. In addition, MIC possesses promising MR contrast properties, which allow for direct detection of myelin distribution through T <sub>1</sub> mapping in the mouse brain. © 2011 American Chemical Society.</p>"

Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed acute disseminating encephalomyelitis (ADEM)-like lesions without gadolinium enhancement (GDE). One year later, she had an episode of bilateral optic neuritis and cerebellar ataxia. Speech deficit and right hand weakness occurred at the age of 51 years. Neurological examination showed motor aphasia, finger agnosia, right-left disorientation, and right hand paresis. Neuromyelitis optica (NMO)-IgG was seropositive. Cerebrospinal fluid examination showed negative results for myelin basic protein and oligoclonal IgG band. The IgG index was normal. Brain MRI revealed a tumefactive lesion in the left temporo-parietal region and conglomerate ovoid lesions in the pericallosal regions. No GDE was found in the brain lesions. Visual evoked potential test showed bilateral prolongation of P100 latencies. She was treated twice with methylprednisolone pulse therapy followed by oral prednisolone, but the motor aphasia did not respond to steroid treatment. She had no prior history of myelitis and was diagnosed as NMO spectrum disorder (NMOSD). Similar to previous studies of NMO-IgG seropositive extensive brain lesions, this patient with NMOSD indicated no GDE in tumefactive lesions at two episodes of encephalopathy. Compared to multiple sclerosis (MS), a high frequency of non-enhancing tumefactive lesions is reported in patients with NMO or NMOSD. The absence of GDE in tumefactive lesions could help to differentiate between NMO and MS. © 2011 The Japanese Society of Internal Medicine.</p>"

We describe a new imaging strategy combining video rate reflectance and fluorescence confocal imaging with coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) microscopy tuned to CH2 vibration of myelin lipids, applied in live tissue of animals with chronic experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Our method allows monitoring over time of demyelination and neurodegeneration in brain slices with high spatial resolution and signal-to-noise ratio. Local areas of severe loss of lipid signal indicative of demyelination and loss of the reflectance signal from axons were seen in the corpus callosum and spinal cord of EAE animals. Even in myelinated areas of EAE mice, the intensity of myelin lipid signals is significantly reduced. Using heterozygous knock-in mice in which green fluorescent protein replaces the CX <sub>3</sub>CR1 coding sequence that labels central nervous system microglia, we find areas of activated microglia colocalized with areas of altered reflectance and CARS signals reflecting axonal injury and demyelination.

A reproducible focal white matter lesion was used to reliably compare treatment conditions. Methods: The corpus callosum of female Sprague Dawley rats was injected with zymosan to promote microglial activation as confirmed by hematoxylin and eosin staining, <sup>3</sup>H-PK11195 autoradiography, and CD11b immunohistochemistry. A subset of subjects was treated systemically with minocycline to potentially alter microglial activation. Seven days after zymosan injection, subjects were imaged with PET using the radiotracer <sup>11</sup>C-(R)-PK11195. In vivo binding was evaluated using the distribution volume ratio (DVR) with respect to a reference region. Results: At the lesion site, the observed <sup>11</sup>C-(R)-PK11195 DVR for each treatment was as follows: mean saline DVR ± SD, 1.17 ± 0.05 (n = 5); zymosan-only DVR, 1.96 ± 0.33 (n = 10); and zymosan with minocycline DVR, 1.58 ± 0.12 (n = 9). Therefore, compared with controls, zymosan increased binding (P = 0.0001, 2-tailed t test) and minocycline treatment reduced zymosan-induced binding by 46% (P = 0.004, 2-tailed t test). Conclusion: Zymosan-induced microglial activation and its response to minocycline can be quantitatively imaged in the rat brain using <sup>11</sup>C-(R)-PK11195 PET.

Corpus callosum (CC) is the main structure involved in interhemispheric information transfer; CC pathology occurs in patients with multiple sclerosis (PwMS) and is related to altered performance of tasks requiring interhemispheric transfer of sensorimotor information. To investigate the role of CC in nonspecific transfer during a pure motor reaction-time task, we combined motor behavior with diffusion tensor imaging analysis in PwMS. Twenty-two PwMS and 10 controls, all right-handed, were asked to respond to random stimuli with appropriate finger opposition movements with the right (learning) and then the left (transfer) hand. PwMS were able to improve motor performance reducing response times with practice with a trend similar to controls and preserved the ability to transfer the acquired motor information from the learning to the transfer hand. A higher variability in the transfer process, indicated by a significantly larger standard deviation of mean nonspecific transfer, was found in the PwMS group with respect to the control group, suggesting the presence of subtle impairments in interhemispheric communication in some patients. Then, we correlated the amount of nonspecific transfer with mean fractional anisotropy (FA) values, indicative of microstructural damage, obtained in five CC subregions identified on PwMS's FA maps. A significant correlation was found only in the subregion including posterior midbody (Pearson's r = 0.74, P = 0.003), which thus seems to be essential for the interhemispheric transfer of information related to pure sensorimotor tasks.

Here, we have established and characterized a novel model of genetically induced adult oligodendrocyte death. Specific primary loss of adult oligodendrocytes leads to a well defined and highly reproducible course of disease development that can be followed longitudinally by magnetic resonance imaging. Histological and ultrastructural analyses revealed progressive myelin vacuolation, in parallel to disease development that includes motor deficits, tremor, and ataxia. Myelin damage and clearance were associated with induction of oligodendrocyte precursor cell proliferation, albeit with some regional differences. Remyelination was present in the mildly affected corpus callosum. Consequences of acutely induced cell death of adult oligodendrocytes included secondary axonal damage. Microglia were activated in affected areas but without significant influx of B-cells, T-helper cells, or T-cytotoxic cells. Analysis of the model on a RAG-1 (recombination activating gene-1)-deficient background, lacking functional lymphocytes, did not change the observed disease and pathology compared with immune-competent mice. We conclude that this model provides the opportunity to study the consequences of adult oligodendrocyte death in the absence of primary axonal injury and reactive cells of the adaptive immune system. Our results indicate that if the blood- brain barrier is not disrupted, myelin debris is not removed efficiently, remyelination is impaired, and axonal integrity is compromised, likely as the result of myelin detachment.

Methods: A total of 78 individuals with MS underwent a median of 3 scans over 2 years. Diffusion tensor imaging indices, magnetization transfer ratio, and T2 relaxation time were analyzed in supratentorial brain, corpus callosum, optic radiations, and corticospinal tracts by atlas-based tractography. Linear mixed-effect models estimated annualized rates of change for each index, and sample size estimates for potential clinical trials were determined. Results: There were significant changes over time in fractional anisotropy and perpendicular diffusivity in the supratentorial brain and corpus callosum, mean diffusivity in the supratentorial brain, and magnetization transfer ratio in all areas studied. Changes were most rapid in the corpus callosum, where fractional anisotropy decreased 1.7% per year, perpendicular diffusivity increased 1.2% per year, and magnetization transfer ratio decreased 0.9% per year. The T2 relaxation time changed more rapidly than diffusion tensor imaging indices and magnetization transfer ratio but had higher within-participant variability. Magnetization transfer ratio in the corpus callosum and supratentorial brain declined at an accelerated rate in progressive MS relative to relapsing-remitting MS. Power analysis yielded reasonable sample sizes (on the order of 40 participants per arm or fewer) for 1- or 2-year trials. Conclusions: Longitudinal changes in whole-brain and tract-specific diffusion tensor imaging indices and magnetization transfer ratio can be reliably quantified, suggesting that small clinical trials using these outcome measures are feasible. © 2011 by AAN Enterprises, Inc.</p>"

However, the variety of disorders in children has an odd range of features that have piqued the interest of researchers. Information concerning this group of diseases, both in vivo and in different age groups, has particularly progressed with the advent of magnetic resonance imaging in the last few decades. In this article, we provide an overview of the applicability of imaging for idiopathic inflammatory demyelinating disorders of the central nervous system in children. In addition to pediatric multiple sclerosis, this review addresses other related disorders, such as acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, pediatric neuromyelitis optica, recurrent optic neuritis, and relapsing transverse myelitis. © 2013 by Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins.</p>"

1056,2-s2.0-83755205954,Quantification of increased cellularity during inflammatory demyelination,"<p>Multiple sclerosis is characterized by inflammatory demyelination and irreversible axonal injury leading to permanent neurological disabilities. Diffusion tensor imaging demonstrates an improved capability over standard magnetic resonance imaging to differentiate axon from myelin pathologies. However, the increased cellularity and vasogenic oedema associated with inflammation cannot be detected or separated from axon/myelin injury by diffusion tensor imaging, limiting its clinical applications. A novel diffusion basis spectrum imaging, capable of characterizing water diffusion properties associated with axon/myelin injury and inflammation, was developed to quantitatively reveal white matter pathologies in central nervous system disorders. Tissue phantoms made of normal fixed mouse trigeminal nerves juxtaposed with and without gel were employed to demonstrate the feasibility of diffusion basis spectrum imaging to quantify baseline cellularity in the absence and presence of vasogenic oedema. Following the phantom studies, in vivo diffusion basis spectrum imaging and diffusion tensor imaging with immunohistochemistry validation were performed on the corpus callosum of cuprizone treated mice. Results demonstrate that in vivo diffusion basis spectrum imaging can effectively separate the confounding effects of increased cellularity and/or grey matter contamination, allowing successful detection of immunohistochemistry confirmed axonal injury and/or demyelination in middle and rostral corpus callosum that were missed by diffusion tensor imaging. In addition, diffusion basis spectrum imaging-derived cellularity strongly correlated with numbers of cell nuclei determined using immunohistochemistry. Our findings suggest that diffusion basis spectrum imaging has great potential to provide non-invasive biomarkers for neuroinflammation, axonal injury and demyelination coexisting in multiple sclerosis. © The Author (2011).</p>"

The identification of an autoantibody exclusively detected in NMO patients against aquaporin-4 (AQP-4) has allowed identification of cases beyond the classical phenotype. Brain lesions, once thought as infrequent, can be observed in NMO patients, but lesions have different characteristics from the ones seen in multiple sclerosis. Additionally, some AQP-4 antibody positive patients may present with a variety of symptoms not being restricted to optic neuritis and acute myelitis during the first attack or in a relapse. Examples are not limited to, but may include patients only with brain and/or brainstem lesions, narcolepsy with hypothalamic lesions or patients with intractable hiccups, nausea and vomiting. The prompt identification of NMO patients with atypical presentations may benefit these patients with institution of early treatment to reduce disability and prevent further attacks.</p>"

We applied serial, 3D high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging to transplanted neural precursor cells (NPCs) labeled with superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles and 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine, and compared the migration pattern of NPCs in acute inflamed (n = 10) versus chronic demyelinated (n = 9) brains of mice induced with experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE). Serial in vivo and ex-vivo 3D magnetic resonance imaging revealed that NPCs migrated 2.5 ± 1.3 mm along the corpus callosum in acute EAE. In chronic EAE, cell migration was slightly reduced (2.3 ± 1.3 mm) and only occurred in the lateral side of transplantation. Surprisingly, in 6/10 acute EAE brains, NPCs were found to migrate in a radial pattern along RECA-1<sup>+</sup> cortical blood vessels, in a pattern hitherto only reported for migrating glioblastoma cells. This striking radial biodistribution pattern was not detected in either chronic EAE or disease-free control brains. In both acute and chronic EAE brain, Iba1<sup>+</sup> microglia/macrophage number was significantly higher in central nervous system regions containing migrating NPCs. The existence of differential NPC migration patterns is an important consideration for implementing future translational studies in multiple sclerosis patients with variable disease.

The studies of 98 patients who underwent imaging with DE T2, FLAIR and DIR sequences for known or suspected multiple sclerosis were retrospectively reviewed. In 42 cases, a diagnosis of MS had been clinically suspected. In the remaining 56 cases, a diagnosis of MS had been previously established. All patients were imaged on a 3T MRI unit. Coronal and sagittal FLAIR, axial DE T2, and three dimensional T2-weighted DIR sequences were utilised. Of the 42 patients with suspected multiple sclerosis, 11 demonstrated lesions characteristic of the disease. Demyelinating plaques were seen in all of the 56 patients with known MS. In all cases, all lesions seen on DE T2-or FLAIR sequences were visible and more conspicuous on the DIR sequence. In 22 of the 67 patients (33%) with demyelinating lesions, the DIR sequence showed additional lesions not visible on any of the other sequences. Additional detected lesions predominantly involved grey matter. At 3 Tesla, a T2 weighted, three dimensional DIR sequence is as accurate at detecting the presence of intracranial demyelinating lesions as two dimensional FLAIR and DE T2 sequences combined. A greater number of lesions were detected with the DIR sequence, and all lesions were more conspicuous. A single, stand alone DIR sequence may be considered appropriate for monitoring MS.</p>"

Unplanned pregnancies occur and risks related to exposure remain unclear. Methods: To determine pregnancy outcomes following interferon-beta therapy, we examined pregnancies from a global drug safety database containing individual case safety reports received in the post-marketing setting and safety data from clinical trials of subcutaneous interferon beta-1a in MS. Results: One thousand and twenty-two cases of exposure to subcutaneous interferon beta-1a during pregnancy were retrieved; 679 had a documented outcome. In cases for which exposure duration was available (n = 231), mean time of foetal exposure to subcutaneous interferon beta-1a before treatment discontinuation was 28 days; most pregnancies (199/231; 86.1%) were exposed for 45 days. To avoid bias, only outcomes for prospective data (n = 425) in pregnancies exposed to interferon beta-1a in utero were analysed further. Of these, 324 (76.2%) resulted in normal live births and four (0.9%) in live births with congenital anomalies (3 [0.7%] were 'major'). Four (0.9%) pregnancies resulted in stillbirths (1 [0.2%] with foetal defects). There were 5 (1.2%) ectopic pregnancies, 49 (11.5%) spontaneous abortions and 39 (9.2%) elective terminations. Most pregnancies exposed to subcutaneous interferon beta-1a in utero were associated with normal live births. The rates of spontaneous abortion and major congenital anomalies in live births were in line with those observed in the general population. Conclusions: These data should be taken into account when considering options for women with MS who become pregnant or who are planning pregnancy while on treatment with subcutaneous interferon beta-1a. © The Author(s) 2011.</p>"

Methods: Brain conventional and DT MRI scans were acquired from 48 patients with paediatric MS (10 clinically isolated syndromes (CIS), 38 relapsing remitting (RR) MS), 30 adult CIS, 27 adult RRMS, 15 paediatric healthy controls (HC) and 18 adult HC. T2-lesion probability maps and DT MRI of lesions, NAWM and GM were compared among controls and MS groups. Results: T2-visible lesion volumes did not differ among patient groups, but T2 lesions were more frequently located in the posterior periventricular regions in adult RRMS patients than in adult CIS and paediatric RRMS patients. Adult RRMS patients had a significantly higher lesion average mean diffusivity than paediatric RRMS patients. No DT MRI changes in the NA tissues were found in paediatric and adult CIS patients. DT MRI abnormalities were limited to the NAWM in paediatric RRMS patients, while they involved the NAWM and GM in adult RRMS patients. The extent of NAWM involvement was similar between adult and paediatric RRMS patients and was significantly correlated with T2-visible lesion burden. Conclusions: A less severe intrinsic lesion damage, a less frequent lesion occurrence in the posterior periventricular WM and the sparing of GM may help to explain the favourable short-/medium-term disease outcome of paediatric MS.</p>"

It has been suggested that the presence of PSA in demyelinated lesions in multiple sclerosis could prevent axon-glia interactions inhibiting spontaneous remyelination. The enzyme St8siaIV is one of the two polysialyltransferases responsible for PSA synthesis, and it is predominantly active during adult life. Here we treated 8-10-weeks old St8siaIV deficient and wild-type mice for 5 weeks with cuprizone, which is a reliable model for de- and remyelination in the corpus callosum and cortex. Developmental myelination of the St8siaIV knock-out mice was not disturbed and adult mice showed normal myelin protein expression. Demyelination did not differ between transgenic and wild-type mice but early myelin protein re-expression and thus remyelination were accelerated in St8siaIV knock-out mice during the first week after withdrawal of the toxin. This was mainly due to enhanced oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPC) differentiation and to a lesser extent to OPC recruitment. These data are proof of principle that PSA expression interferes at least to some extent with remyelination in vivo. © 2010 IBRO.</p>"

We propose an alternative measurement plane based on the role of the CC as a bottleneck structure in determining the rate of interhemispheric neural transmission. We designate this plane as the Minimum Corpus Callosum Area Plane (MCCAP), which captures the cross section of the CC that best represents an upper bound on interhemispheric transmission. Our MCCAP extraction method uses a nested optimization framework, segmenting the CC as it appears on each candidate plane, using registration-based segmentation. We demonstrate the robust convergence and high accuracy of our method for magnetic resonance images and present preliminary clinical results showing higher sensitivity to disease-induced atrophy. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.</p>"

1067,2-s2.0-78249258697,"Oligodendrocyte PTEN is required for myelin and axonal integrity, not remyelination","<p>Objective Repair of myelin injury in multiple sclerosis may fail, resulting in chronic demyelination, axonal loss, and disease progression. As cellular pathways regulated by phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN; eg, phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase [PI-3K]) have been reported to enhance axon regeneration and oligodendrocyte maturation, we investigated potentially beneficial effects of Pten loss of function in the oligodendrocyte lineage on remyelination. Methods We characterized oligodendrocyte numbers and myelin sheath thickness in mice with conditional inactivation of Pten in oligodendrocytes, Olig2-cre, Pten <sup>fl/fl</sup> mice. Using a model of central nervous system demyelination, lysolecithin injection into the spinal cord white matter, we performed short- and long-term lesioning experiments and quantified oligodendrocyte maturation and myelin sheath thickness in remyelinating lesions. Results During development, we observed dramatic hypermyelination in the corpus callosum and spinal cord. Following white matter injury, however, there was no detectable improvement in remyelination. Moreover, we observed progressive myelin sheath abnormalities and massive axon degeneration in the fasciculus gracilis of mutant animals, as indicated by ultrastructure and expression of SMI-32, amyloid precursor protein, and caspase 6. Interpretation These studies indicate adverse effects of chronic Pten inactivation (and by extension, activation PI-3K signaling) on myelinating oligodendrocytes and their axonal targets. We conclude that PTEN function in oligodendrocytes is required to regulate myelin thickness and preserve axon integrity. In contrast, PTEN is dispensable during myelin repair, and its inactivation confers no detectable benefit. © American Neurological Association.</p>"
1068,2-s2.0-77957759539,Characterization of brain lesions in a mouse model of progressive multiple sclerosis,"<p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease of the central nervous system characterized by damage to the neuronal myelin sheath, which results in different levels of muscle paralysis that can lead to neuronal death. In most MS mouse models, the neurologic damage mostly affects the spinal cord with limited damage to the brain, which cannot be monitored by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as used for humans. We show that immunization of non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice with myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein peptide 35-55 leads to the development of relapsing-remitting stages, evident from days 20 to 70, which then develops into a chronic progressive stage. This cycle is similar to MS stages found in humans. Brain MRI gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted image analysis showed an increased blood-brain barrier permeability in brain gray and white matter specific to the corpus callosum, fimbria, and internal capsule as found in humans. MRI fractional anisotropy analysis showed demyelination and axonal damage in identical regions. Immunohistologic analysis supported the MRI data. No evidence of brain lesions was found in a common model of MS using C57BL/6 mice. We suggest that an increase in astrocyte toxicity in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis-induced NOD mice may be linked to brain lesion development. We suggest using NOD mice as a suitable model for studying MS using MRI methods toward future diagnostic and drug development. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.</p>"

Objective: To evaluate corpus callosum atrophy in patients with multiple sclerosis in comparison to global brain atrophy and its relation to clinical disability. Methods: forty two patients with multiple sclerosis and 32 health age and sex matched controls were included in this study. MS was diagnosed according to McDonald's criteria. Magnetic resonance imaging was performed for both patients and controls. Measurement of corpus callosum index and intercaudate ratio was performed for both patients and controls. Results: CCI was significantly lower in patients compared to controls.

The lateral ventricle volume in MS patients was increased; the fractional anisotropy in the CC was decreased as was the fiber volume. Perpendicular (in the literature also referred to as radial) diffusivity (ped), which reflects the diffusion perpendicular to the long axis of the axons within the fiber bundle, was increased in the SLF and the posterior CC, but contrary to our predictions, parallel (also called axial) diffusivity (pad) that refers to the amount of diffusion in the direction of the axon was increased, too. Brain atrophy and DTI-derived parameters were highly intercorrelated and both correlated with disease duration. Discriminant analysis showed that DTI-derived atrophy measures are superior to brain atrophy measures in classifying patients and controls.

Therapeutic strategies that induce effective neuroprotection and enhance intrinsic repair mechanisms are central goals for future therapy of multiple sclerosis. Oestrogens and oestrogen receptor ligands are promising treatments to prevent multiple sclerosis-induced neurodegeneration. In the present study we investigated the capacity of oestrogen receptor β ligand treatment to affect callosal axon demyelination and stimulate endogenous myelination in chronic experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis using electrophysiology, electron microscopy, immunohistochemistry and tract-tracing methods. Oestrogen receptor β ligand treatment of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis mice prevented both histopathological and functional abnormalities of callosal axons despite the presence of inflammation. Specifically, there were fewer demyelinated, damaged axons and more myelinated axons with intact nodes of Ranvier in oestrogen receptor β ligand-treated mice. In addition, oestrogen receptor β ligand treatment caused an increase in mature oligodendrocyte numbers, a significant increase in myelin sheath thickness and axon transport. Functional analysis of callosal axon conduction showed a significant improvement in compound action potential amplitudes, latency and in axon refractoriness. These findings show a direct neuroprotective effect of oestrogen receptor β ligand treatment on oligodendrocyte differentiation, myelination and axon conduction during experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. © 2010 The Author.</p>"

Corpus callosum (CC) is commonly involved during the disease process leading to atrophy (93%). Currently, there are no established markers of disease progression and the interplay of processes leading to brain atrophy in MS remains unknown. The primary aim of this study was to assess the frequency of CC atrophy in MS patients. Furthermore, the relationship between expanded disability status scale (EDSS) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) evoked motor potentials (MEP) were assessed to capture disease effects by independent parameters. Seventy-nine MS patients and 50 controls were included and their CC volumes were assessed. Out of 79 patients, 31 patients (39•2%) had CC atrophy. The distribution of EDSS scores among the group with CC atrophy [13 (32%) patients with EDSS 0-2; 11 (58%) patients with EDSS 2-4; 19 (24%) patients with EDSS ≥4] was not statistically significant (p&gt;0•05). MEP latency was abnormal in 34 (43%) patients, 67 (85%) patients had abnormal MEP amplitude and CMCT was abnormal in 32 (41%) patients. The relation between EDSS and MEP was statistically significant among the patient population including the subgroup of patients with CC atrophy (p&lt;0.05). Our results lacked to provide an association between disability and CC atrophy, but there was a correlation between CC atrophy and TMS evoked motor potentials. Early evolution of axonal degeneration and brain atrophy should be considered in terms of follow-up measures to provide long-term efficiency impacting disability, progression and brain atrophy. © 2010 Maney Publishing.</p>"

The spatiotemporal distribution pattern of WM lesions, their relations to regional GM changes and the underlying dynamics are unclear. Here we combined parametric and non-parametric voxel-based morphometry (VBM) to clarify these issues. MRI data from RRMS patients with progressive (PLV, n = 45) and non-progressive WM lesion volumes (NPLV, n = 44) followed up for 12 months were analysed. Cross-sectionally, the spatial WM lesion distribution was compared using lesion probability maps (LPMs). Longitudinally, WM lesions and GM volumes were studied using FSL-VBM and SPM5-VBM, respectively. WM lesions clustered around the lateral ventricles and in the centrum semiovale with a more widespread pattern in the PLV than in the NPLV group. The maximum local probabilities were similar in both groups and higher for T2 lesions (PLV: 27%, NPLV: 25%) than for T1 lesions (PLV: 15%, NPLV 14%). Significant WM lesion changes accompanied by cortical GM volume reductions occured in the corpus callosum and optic radiations (P = 0.01 corrected), and more liberally tested (uncorrected P &lt; 0.01) in the inferior fronto-occipital and longitudinal fasciculi, and corona radiata in the PLV group. Not any WM or GM changes were found in the NPLV group. In the PLV group, WM lesion distribution and development in fibres, was associated with regional GM volume loss. The different spatiotemporal distribution patterns of patients with progressive compared to patients with non-progressive WM lesions suggest differences in the dynamics of pathogenesis. © 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.</p>"
1076,2-s2.0-77956160406,Corpus callosum shape deformation analysis for multiple,"<p>Neurological diseases can cause atrophy of the corpus callosum resulting in a change in its size and shape. The measurement and analysis of this change is one of the goals of clinical research. We perform statistical analysis of the shape of the corpus callosum extracted from MR brain scans of a group of multiple sclerosis patients undergoing a longitudinal (serial) study. In contrast to the classical boundary-based, global shape variability measures, e.g.kernel principal component analysis (KPCA) of corpus callosum boundary vertices, we perform a deformation-specific KPCA for analyzing the global and regional shape of the corpus callosum. This deformation specific KPCA is based on a medial-based shape representation. The adopted shape representation describes shape variability in terms of intuitive deformations. We present qualitative and quantitative results for MR images of the corpus callosum. We show that our method is successful in identifying and quantifying the effect of each type of deformation on the shape variability of the corpus callosum. In addition to analyzing the spatial shape variability in the corpus callosum, we explore shape changes as the disease progresses. Our method allowsthe exploration of the shape variability quantitatively as well as in a qualitative visual manner (e.g. by visualizing, say, the 2nd principal mode of shape variation due to bending at the 4th sub-region of the corpus callosum) which is useful for developing an intuitive understanding of the effects of MS on the corpus callosum shape. © 2010 IEEE.</p>"

Serological examination for NMO-IgG was not performed in all the cases. We confirmed that the expression of AQP4 is strongly inhibited in demyelinating lesions of NMO, accompanied by the loss of grial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) expression. The expression of AQP4 is preserved in MS lesions losing myelin basic protein (MBP) positivity. Therefore, AQP4 immunoreactivity may distinguish NMO from MS neuropathologically. NMO preferentially exhibited central lesions of the spinal cord with strongly necrotizing features and axonal injury. One NMO patient with oligoclonal band in the cerebrospinal fluid presented severe necrotizing lesions of the corpus callosum, cerebral white matter in addition to optic nerves and longitudinally extensive spinal cord lesions. Another patient with MS presented longitudinally extensive spinal cord lesions and a lesion in the medullary tegmentum in the floor of the fourth ventricle, which is reported to be one of the vulnerable lesions of NMO. We also reported a patient with NMO accompanied with Sjögren syndrome. These findings suggest that longitudinally extensive spinal cord lesions and medullary tegmentum lesion may be found in MS, and cerebral white matter lesion may be found in NMO. The distribution of lesions may overlap in MS and NMO although the immunoreactivity of AQP4 differs in these 2 conditions.</p>"
1079,2-s2.0-77957574526,Corpus callosum volume and interhemispheric transfer in multiple sclerosis,"<p>Background: The corpus callosum (CC) is frequently compromised in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). Structural and functional measurements of the CC may be useful to monitor the progression of the disease. The aim of this pilot study was to determine if bimanual tactile temporal thresholds correlates with CC volume. A tactile temporal threshold is the longest temporal interval that separates the onsets of two tactile stimuli when they are judged by the observer as simultaneous. Judgments to bimanual stimulations require interhemispheric transfer via the CC. Methods: Thresholds were examined in MS patients and matched controls. Magnetic resonance (MR) images were acquired on a 3T MR system within 48 hours of clinical assessment and measurement of thresholds. Results: Corpus callosum volume was assessed by using a semiautomatic livewire algorithm. The CC volume was smaller (by 21% on average, p &lt; 0.01) and thresholds were higher (by 49% on average, p &lt; 0.03) in MS patients when compared to controls. A significant correlation (r = -0.66, p = 0.01) between CC volume and thresholds emerged for the MS patients. Conclusion: Measuring treatment benefits of neuroprotective and repair therapies is a well recognized challenge in MS research. The overall findings of this study suggest that these measurements, which involve the transfer of information interhemispherically via the CC, may be promising outcome measures that warrant further scientific exploration to develop a model to measure recovery.</p>"

1081,2-s2.0-77956228133,Modulus and direction of the neural current vector identify distinct functional connectivity modes between human MT+ areas,"<p>Reconstruction of neural current sources from magnetoencephalography (MEG) data provides two independent estimates of the instantaneous current modulus and its direction. Here, we explore how different information on the modulus and direction affects the inter-hemisphere connectivity of the human medial temporal complex (hMT+). Connectivity was quantified by mutual information values of paired time series of current moduli or directions, with the joint probability distribution estimated with an optimized Gaussian kernel. These time series were obtained from tomographic analysis of single-trial MEG responses to a visual motion stimulus. With a high-contrast stimulus, connectivity measures based on the modulus were relatively strong in the prestimulus period, continuing until 100. ms after stimulus onset. The strongest modulus connectivity was produced with a long lag (19. ms) of the right hMT+ after the left hMT+. On the other hand, connectivity measures based on direction were relatively strong after 100. ms, with a short delay of less than 6. ms. These results suggest that nonspecific and probably indirect communication between the homologous areas is turned, by the stimulus arrival, into more precise and direct communication through the corpus callosum. The orientation of the estimated current vector for the strong connectivity can be explained by the curvature of the active cortical sheet. The temporal patterns of modulus and directional connectivity were different at low contrast, but similar to those at high contrast. We conclude that the modulus and direction indicate distinct functional connectivity modes. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.</p>"
1082,2-s2.0-77955949612,Brain single photon emission computed tomography with Tc-99m MIBI or Tc-99m ECD in comparison to MRI in multiple sclerosis,"<p>Purpose: To evaluate whether or not brain single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) with Tc-99m MIBI or Tc-99m ECD (ethyl cysteinate dimer) can detect any abnormality in patients with definite multiple sclerosis (MS). We then compared these values with the results of T1, T2, and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Materials and Methods: A total of 16 patients with proved MS were enrolled in the study, and the MRI with and without gadolinium contrast and also brain SPECT with Tc-99m MIBI (8 cases) or Tc-99m ECD (8 other cases) were performed. Results: MRI studies was performed in 16 patients (13 women and 3 men, aged 16-38 years) and an average of 10.47, 3.7, 5.3, 1.7, and 0.9 lesions was found in respect in periventricular white matter, juxtacortical white matter, corpus callosum, cerebellar peduncles, and brainstem, whereas brain SPECT with Tc-99m MIBI or Tc-99m ECD detected no abnormality. In addition, 6 cases had some degree of contrast enhancement. Conclusions: It seems that brain SPECT with Tc-99m MIBI or Tc-99m ECD would not improve this insufficiency. The small sizes of some plaques, particularly in chronic atrophic form of lesions, and the possibility of deeper anatomic positions of plaques can explain to some extent why the MS lesions were impossible to delineate on brain scan, although additional studies are needed.

1083,2-s2.0-77955478688,Effects of fumaric acids on cuprizone induced central nervous system de- and remyelination in the mouse,"<p>Background: Fumaric acid esters (FAE) are a group of compounds which are currently under investigation as an oral treatment for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. One of the suggested modes of action is the potential of FAE to exert a neuroprotective effect. Methodology/Principal Findings: We have investigated the impact of monomethylfumarate (MMF) and dimethylfumaric acid (DMF) on de- and remyelination using the toxic cuprizone model where the blood-brain-barrier remains intact and only scattered T-cells and peripheral macrophages are found in the central nervous system (CNS), thus excluding the influence of immunomodulatory effects on peripheral immune cells. FAE showed marginally accelerated remyelination in the corpus callosum compared to controls. However, we found no differences for demyelination and glial reactions in vivo and no cytoprotective effect on oligodendroglial cells in vitro. In contrast, DMF had a significant inhibitory effect on lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced nitric oxide burst in microglia and induced apoptosis in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Conclusions: These results contribute to the understanding of the mechanism of action of fumaric acids. Our data suggest that fumarates have no or only little direct protective effects on oligodendrocytes in this toxic model and may act rather indirectly via the modulation of immune cells. © 2010 Moharregh-Khiabani et al.</p>"

1085,2-s2.0-77955922447,Corpus callosum index and long-term disability in multiple sclerosis patients,"<p>Prediction of long-term disability in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) is essential. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measurement of brain volume may be of predictive value but sophisticated MRI techniques are often inaccessible in clinical practice. The corpus callosum index (CCI) is a normalized measurement that reflects changes of brain volume. We investigated medical records and 533 MRI scans at diagnosis and during clinical follow-up of 169 MS patients (mean age 42 ± 11 years, 86% relapsing-remitting MS, time since first relapse 11 ± 9 years). CCI at diagnosis was 0.345 ± 0.04 and correlated with duration of disease (p = 0.002; r = -0.234) and expanded disability status scale (EDSS) score at diagnosis (r = -0.428; p &lt; 0.001). Linear regression analyses identified age, duration of disease, relapse rate and EDSS at diagnosis as independent predictors for disability after mean of 7.1 years (Nagelkerkes' R:0.56). Annual CCI decrease was 0.01 ± 0.02 (annual tissue loss: 1.3%). In secondary progressive MS patients, CCI decrease was double compared to that in relapsing-remitting MS patients (p = 0.04). There was a trend of greater CCI decrease in untreated patients compared to those who received disease modifying drugs (p = 0.2). CCI is an easy to use MRI marker for estimating brain atrophy in patients with MS. Brain atrophy as measured with CCI was associated with disability progression but it was not an independent predictor of long-term disability. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.</p>"

1087,2-s2.0-77953703128,17β-estradiol protects male mice from cuprizone-induced demyelination and oligodendrocyte loss,"<p>In addition to regulating reproductive functions in the brain and periphery, estrogen has tropic and neuroprotective functions in the central nervous system (CNS). Estrogen administration has been demonstrated to provide protection in several animal models of CNS disorders, including stroke, brain injury, epilepsy, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, age-related cognitive decline and multiple sclerosis. Here, we use a model of toxin-induced oligodendrocyte death which results in demyelination, reactive gliosis, recruitment of oligodendrocyte precursor cells and subsequent remyelination to study the potential benefit of 17β-estradiol (E2) administration in male mice. The results indicate that E2 partially ameliorates loss of oligodendrocytes and demyelination in the corpus callosum. This protection is accompanied by a delay in microglia accumulation as well as reduced mRNA expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokine, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα), and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1). E2 did not significantly alter the accumulation of astrocytes or oligodendrocyte precursor cells, or remyelination. These data obtained from a toxin-induced, T cell-independent model using male mice provide an expanded view of the beneficial effects of estrogen on oligodendrocyte and myelin preservation. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.</p>"

The antiphospholipid syndrome (APL) is an autoimmune disease characterized by the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies and at least one clinical manifestation Both diseases have similar clinical manifestations and sometimes it is not possible to obtain a proper finding to differentiate them by MRI. In MS, the corpus callosum is a structure that is invariably affected, unlike APL in which there is no apparent involvement of the corpus callosum and therefore we expected to find differences in the fractional anisotropy (FA) measured in the corpus callosum of patients, thus providing another tool to aid in the differential diagnosis. Our study showed statistically significant differences in the FA of the corpus callosum of patients with MS (FA rating: 0.65122; DE: 0.07588, P = 0.006) and APL (FA rating: 0.66777; DE: 0.05715, P = 0.024), and in the control group (FA rating: 0.73222, DE: 0.03671). However, no difference was found between the group of patients with MS and the group of patients with APL (p = 0.334). This study contributes to the study of patients with APL as it showed that like in MS, a reduced corpus callosum FA is observed with respect to control subjects, perhaps secondary to microstructural alteration of the myelin sheaths of white matter with normal appearance. ©INNN, 2010.</p>"
1089,2-s2.0-77954732542,Rostrocaudal analysis of corpus callosum demyelination and axon damage across disease stages refines diffusion tensor imaging correlations with pathological features,"<p>Noninvasive assessment of the progression of axon damage is important for evaluating disease progression and developing neuroprotective interventions in multiple sclerosis patients. We examined thecellular responses correlated with diffusion tensor imaging-derivedaxial (λII) and radial (λ ⊥) diffusivity values throughout acute (4 weeks) and chronic (12 weeks) stages of demyelination and after 6 weeks of recovery using the cuprizone demyelination of the corpus callosum model in C57BL/6 and Thy1-YFP-16 mice. The rostrocaudal progression of pathological alterations in the corpus callosum enabled spatially and temporally defined correlations of pathological features with diffusion tensor imaging measurements. During acute demyelination, microglial/macrophage activation was most extensive and axons exhibited swellings, neurofilament dephosphorylation, and reduced diameters. Axial diffusivity values decreased in the acute phase but did not correlate with axonal atrophy during chronic demyelination. In contrast, radial diffusivity increased with the progression of demyelination but did not correlate with myelin loss orastrogliosis. Unlike other animal models with progressive neurodegeneration and axon loss, the acute axon damage did not progress to discontinuity or loss of axons even after a period of chronicdemyelination. Correlations of reversible axon pathology, demyelination, microglia/macrophage activation, and astrogliosis with regional axial and radial diffusivity measurements will facilitate the clinical application of diffusion tensor imaging in multiple sclerosis patients. © 2010 by the American Association of Neuropathologists, Inc.</p>"

When administered via intravenous injection into the tail vein, CMC selectively stained large bundles of myelinated fibers in both the central nervous system (CNS) and the peripheral nervous system (PNS). In the CNS, CMC readily entered the brain and selectively localized in myelinated regions such as the corpus callosum and cerebellum. CMC also selectively stained myelinated nerves in the PNS. The staining patterns of CMC in a hypermyelinated mouse model were consistent with immunohistochemical staining. Similar to immunohistochemical staining, CMC selectively bound to myelin sheaths present in the white matter tracts. Unlike CMC, conventional antibody staining for myelin basic protein also stained oligodendrocyte cytoplasm in the striatum as well as granule layers in the cerebellum. In vivo application of CMC was also demonstrated by fluorescence imaging of myelinated nerves in the PNS. © 2010 Wang et al.</p>"

Increased number of donor cells was observed in brains of the MLD mice transplanted with HoxB4-transduced BM cells (B4MLD) in contrast to those transplanted with control green fluorescent protein (GFP)-transduced BM cells (MIGMLD). Immunohistochemical staining showed that most of the GFP cells were Iba1<sup>+</sup> microglia. In addition, O4<sup>+</sup> oligodendrocytes were identified only in the B4MLD brains but not in the MIGMLD brain. Alcian blue staining showed that accumulation of sulfatide was dramatically reduced in brain tissue from B4MLD mice, and there was a corresponding improvement in the animals' ability to walk a balance beam 8 months after transplantation. Thus transplantation of BM cells overexpressing HoxB4 appears to effectively prevent the progression of MLD in this mouse model. These findings support the idea that hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) transduced with a HoxB4 expression vector could be the useful carriers of therapeutic proteins into the brain for regeneration of oligodendrocytes to treat such demyelinating disorders as MLD, Krabbe disease, and multiple sclerosis. © The American Society of Gene &amp; Cell Therapy.</p>"

Magnetic Resonance (MR) diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is able to quantify in vivo tissue microstructure properties and to detect disease related pathology of the central nervous system. Nevertheless, DTI is limited by low spatial resolution associated with its low signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR). Aim. The aim is to select a DTI sequence for brain clinical studies, optimizing SNR and resolution. Methods and Results. We applied 6 methods for SNR computation in 26 DTI sequences with different parameters using 4 healthy volunteers (HV). We choosed two DTI sequences for their high SNR, they differed by voxel size and b-value. Subsequently, the two selected sequences were acquired from 30 multiple sclerosis (MS) patients with different disability and lesion load and 18 age matched HV. We observed high concordance between mean diffusivity (MD) and fractional anysotropy (FA), nonetheless the DTI sequence with smaller voxel size displayed a better correlation with disease progression, despite a slightly lower SNR. The reliability of corpus callosum (CC) fiber tracking with the chosen DTI sequences was also tested. Conclusion. The sensitivity of DTI-derived indices to MS-related tissue abnormalities indicates that the optimized sequence may be a powerful tool in studies aimed at monitoring the disease course and severity.

1094,2-s2.0-77954653333,CXCR4 promotes differentiation of oligodendrocyte progenitors and remyelination,"<p>Multiple sclerosis is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by episodes of autoimmune attack of oligodendrocytes leading to demyelination and progressive functional deficits. Because many patients exhibit functional recovery in between demyelinating episodes, understanding mechanisms responsible for repair of damaged myelin is critical for developing therapies that promote remyelination and prevent disease progression. The chemokine CXCL12 is a developmental molecule known to orchestrate the migration, proliferation, and differentiation of neuronal precursor cells within the developing CNS. Although studies suggest a role for CXCL12 in oligodendroglia ontogeny in vitro, no studies have investigated the role of CXCL12 in remyelination in vivo in the adult CNS. Using an experimental murine model of demyelination mediated by the copper chelator cuprizone, we evaluated the expression of CXCL12 and its receptor, CXCR4, within the demyelinating and remyelinating corpus callosum (CC). CXCL12 was significantly up-regulated within activated astrocytes and microglia in the CC during demyelination, as were numbers of CXCR4+ NG2+ oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs). Loss of CXCR4 signaling via either pharmacological blockade or in vivo RNA silencing led to decreased OPCs maturation and failure to remyelinate. These data indicate that CXCR4 activation, by promoting the differentiation of OPCs into oligodendrocytes, is critical for remyelination of the injured adult CNS.</p>"

Compared to adults, children are more likely to experience acute or relapsing demyelinating episodes of various etiologies which show similar clinical and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings. Aim: To investigate the fulfillment of MRI diagnostic criteria at initial episode in pediatric MS. Methods: We reviewed our series of children and adolescents with the final diagnosis of clinically definite MS and applied the McDonald dissemination in space (DIS) and KIDMUS criteria to their initial MRI scans. Results: Thirty patients (17 girls, 13 boys), most with brainstem dysfunction and polysymptomatic presentation, were included in the study. Twenty-five (83.3%) patients fulfilled both McDonald and KIDMUS criteria. Patients who did not meet any McDonald DIS criteria did not meet KIDMUS criteria either. Only one patient met the McDonald criteria but not the KIDMUS criteria because of the absence of lesions perpendicular to corpus callosum. Conclusions: Our results show 5/30 (16.6%) of MS patients may not present the diagnostic MRI features initially. The variable sensitivity observed for the current MRI criteria in different series can be due to referral biases, differences between populations and length of follow-up, and the definition of MS patients by two attacks only. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.</p>"

Methods: We analyzed retrospectively brain MRIs (performed 10 or more years after symptom onset) of patients with MS diagnosis and expanded disability status scale of 6 or more. The following parameters were analyzed: total number of brain T2 hyperintensities; number of brainstem, cerebellar, corpus callosum, basal ganglia, and juxtacortical T2 hyperintensities; diffuse leukoencephalopathy score; total number of T1 hypointensities. Results: Eighty-four patients were included. The mean time between symptom onset and MRI was 20.2 years. Eight percent had less than 9 cerebral T2 hyperintensities. Posterior fossa, juxtacortical, and corpus callosum T2 hyperintensities, and T1 hypointensities lacked in respectively 19%, 12%, 47%, and 8%. Overall, normal MRI was not seen, 6% had abnormal MRI but did not meet Barkhof's criteria, and the remaining 94% had MRI abnormalities fulfilling Barkhof's criteria. Moderate or severe diffuse leukoencephalopathy was seen in 69%. Extensive diffuse leukoencephalopathy predominant to nodular lesions was seen in 5%.

In 15 right-handed PPMS patients and 15 age-matched healthy controls, we acquired diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging and fMRI during the performance of a simple motor task. Tractography was used to calculate diffusion tensor-derived measures of the corpus callosum, the corticospinal tract, the optic radiation, the fronto-occipital fasciculus, and the inferior longitudinal fasciculus. Analyses of fMRI activations and functional connectivity were performed using statistical parametric mapping (cluster threshold of P = 0.001, and extent cluster threshold of 10 voxels for comparison of activations; P &lt; 0.05, family-wise error corrected for functional connectivity). As compared with controls, PPMS patients had more significant activations of the left postcentral gyrus, left secondary sensorimotor area, left parahippocampal gyrus, left cerebellum, right primary sensorimotor cortex (SMC), right basal ganglia, right insula, right cingulum, and cuneus bilaterally. As compared with PPMS patients, controls had increased functional connectivity between the left primary SMC and the ipsilateral inferior frontal gyrus. Conversely, PPMS patients showed increased functional connectivity between the left primary SMC and the right cuneus. Moderate correlations were found between functional activations and damage to the tracts studied (r-values between 0.82 and 0.84; P &lt; 0.001). These results suggest that, as compared with healthy controls, PPMS patients show increased activations and abnormal functional connectivity measures in several areas of the sensorimotor network. Such changes are correlated with the structural damage to the white matter fiber bundles connecting these regions. © Federation of European Neuroscience Societies and Blackwell Publishing Ltd.</p>"

Recent studies have suggested diverse mechanisms as underlying demyelination, including a subset of lesions induced by an interaction between metabolic insult to oligodendrocytes and inflammatory mediators. For mice of susceptible strains, cuprizone feeding results in oligodendrocyte cell loss and demyelination of the corpus callosum. Remyelination ensues and has been extensively studied. Cuprizone-induced demyelination remains incompletely characterized. We found that mice lacking the type 2 CXC chemokine receptor (CXCR2) were relatively resistant to cuprizone-induced demyelination and that circulating CXCR2-positive neutrophils were important for cuprizone-induced demyelination. Our findings support a two-hit process of cuprizone-induced demyelination, supporting the idea that multiple sclerosis pathogenesis features extensive oligodendrocyte cell loss. These data suggest that cuprizone-induced demyelination is useful for modeling certain aspects of multiple sclerosis pathogenesis. © 2010 Nature America, Inc. All rights reserved.</p>"

We have previously shown that, in the cuprizone model, demyelination is present not only in the corpus callosum but also in the cerebral cortex. Here, we have performed a detailed analysis of the dynamics of de- and remyelination in the cerebellar cortex and white matter at nine timepoints in two cerebellar regions. To induce demyelination, C57BL/6 mice were fed with 0.2% cuprizone for 12 weeks followed by a recovery of 8 weeks. Both cortex and white-matter structures were significantly demyelinated after 12 weeks of cuprizone feeding. Remyelination occurred after withdrawal of cuprizone but was less prominent in the more caudal cerebellar region. Microglia infiltration was prominent in all analyzed cerebellar areas, preceding demyelination by approximately 2-4 weeks, and was delayed in the more caudal cerebellar region. Astrogliosis was also seen but did not reach the extent observed in the cerebrum. In summary, cuprizone feeding provides an excellent model for the investigation of de- and remyelination processes in the cerebellar cortex and white matter. Furthermore, demyelination, microglia and astrocyte changes were different in the cerebellum as compared with the cerebrum, indicating region-dependent pathomechanisms. © 2009 International Society of Neuropathology.</p>"

However, tract reconstruction can be labor and time intensive and can yield variable results that may reduce the power to link imaging abnormalities with disability. Automated segmentation of these tracts would help make tract-specific imaging clinically useful, but implementation of such segmentation is problematic in the presence of diseases that alter brain structure. In this work, we investigated an automated tract-probability-mapping scheme and applied it to multiple sclerosis, comparing the results to those derived from conventional tractography. We found that the automated method has consistently lower scan-rescan variability (typically 0.7-1.5% vs. up to 3% for conventional tractography) and avoids problems related to tractography failures within and around lesions. In the corpus callosum, optic radiation, and corticospinal tract, tract-specific MRI indices calculated by the two methods were moderately to strongly correlated, though systematic, tract-specific differences were present. In these tracts, the two methods also yielded similar correlation coefficients relating tract-specific MRI indices to clinical disability scores. In the optic tract, the automated method failed. With judicious application, therefore, the automated method may be useful for studies that investigate the relationship between imaging findings and clinical outcomes in disease.</p>"

Materials and Methods: The study was conducted with institutional review board approval. Written informed consent was obtained from each participant. Dual-echo, diffusion-tensor, and functional MR images were acquired from 17 pediatric RR MS patients, 16 adult patients with CIS, 14 adult RR MS patients, and 10 age-matched pediatric healthy control subjects during a simple motor task. Whole-brain, corpus callosum, and CST T2 lesion loads, as well as corpus callosum and CST diffusivity measures were determined. Functional MR imaging data were analyzed by using statistical parametric mapping. Results: Coefficients of effective connectivity of the sensorimotor network were similar in control subjects and pediatric MS patients. In adult patients with CIS and even more evidently in those with RR MS, an increase of intra- and interhemispheric strengths of coefficients of effective connectivity was found (P =.05-.008). The increases in such coefficients were correlated with corpus callosum and CST damage, in terms of T2 lesion load and diffusiontensor MR imaging quantities (r = -0.34 to 0.40). Conclusion: The preservation of brain adaptive properties might explain the favorable medium-term clinical outcome of pediatric MS patients. The progressive recruitment of cortical networks over time in patients with the adult RR forms of the disease might result in a loss of their plastic reservoir, thus possibly contributing to subsequent disease evolution. © RSNA, 2010.</p>"

The objective of this article was to characterize quantitative callosal MRI abnormalities and their association with disability. In 69 participants with MS and 29 healthy volunteers, lesional and extralesional callosal MRI indices were estimated via diffusion tensor tractography. expanded disability status scale (EDSS) and MS functional composite (MSFC) scores were recorded in 53 of the participants with MS. All tested callosal MRI indices were diffusely abnormal in MS. EDSS score was correlated only with age (r = 0.51). Scores on the overall MSFC and its paced serial auditory addition test (PASAT) and 9-hole peg test components were correlated with callosal fractional anisotropy (r = 0.27, 0.35, and 0.31, respectively) and perpendicular diffusivity (r = -0.29, -0.30, and -0.31) but not with overall callosal volume or callosal lesion volume; the PASAT score was more weakly correlated with callosal magnetization-transfer ratio (r = 0.21). Anterior callosal abnormalities were associated with impaired PASAT performance and posterior abnormalities with slow performance on the 9-hole peg test. In conclusion, abnormalities in the corpus callosum can be assessed with quantitative MRI and are associated with cognitive and complex upper-extremity dysfunction in MS.</p>"
1103,2-s2.0-75749119350,Relationships of brain white matter microstructure with clinical and MR measures in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis,"<p>Purpose: To assess the relationships of microstructural damage in the cerebral white matter (WM), as measured by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), with clinical parameters and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures of focal tissue damage in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). Materials and Methods: Forty-five relapsing-remitting (RR) MS patients (12 male, 33 female; median age = 29 years, Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) = 1.5, disease duration = 3 years) were studied. T2-lesion masks were created and voxelwise DTI analyses performed with Tract-Based Spatial Statistics (TBSS). Results: T2-lesion volume (T2-LV) was significantly (P &lt; 0.05, corrected) correlated with fractional anisotropy (FA) in both lesions and normal-appearing WM (NAWM). Relationships (P = 0.08, corrected) between increasing EDSS score and decreasing FA were found in the splenium of the corpus callosum (sCC) and along the pyramidal tract (PY). All FA associations were driven by changes in the perpendicular (to primary tract direction) diffusivity. No significant global and voxelwise FA changes were found over a 2-year follow-up. Conclusion: FA changes related to clinical disability in RR-MS patients with minor clinical disability are localized to specific WM tracts such as the sCC and PY and are driven by changes in perpendicular diffusivity both within lesions and NAWM. Longitudinal DTI measurements do not seem able to chart the early disease course in the WM of MS patients. © 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.</p>"
1104,2-s2.0-74049160870,Cuprizone induces similar demyelination in male and female C57BL/6 mice and results in disruption of the estrous cycle,"<p>Multiple sclerosis is a demyelinating neurological disease that is influenced by gender, primarily reflected in greater susceptibility to disease development in women than in men. Cuprizone intoxication, an animal model that is used to study demyelination and remyelination, has been extensively characterized in male C57BL/6 mice. Here, we have undertaken a comprehensive characterization of the morphological and cellular processes that occur in female C57BL/6J mice during cuprizoneinduced demyelination and subsequent remyelination and compared them with age-matched male mice. We find that the pattern of demyelination and remyelination is similar between genders and that there is little or no difference in the loss or repopulation of mature oligodendrocytes or accumulation of reactive glia. Furthermore, examination of aERKO and bERKO mice suggests that estrogen receptors do not affect the outcome for demyelination or remyelination. Interestingly, we found that cuprizone treatment disrupts estrous cyclicity in female mice, possibly interfering with potential hormone influences on demyelination and remyelination. Therefore, cuprizone-induced demyelination in C57BL/6J mice may have limitations as a model for the study of sex differences. © 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.</p>"
1105,2-s2.0-72749112042,In toxic demyelination oligodendroglial cell death occurs early and is FAS independent,"<p>Oligodendroglial cell death is a frequent phenomenon of many neurological diseases, e.g. in demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS). The underlying mechanisms are largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that in the toxic demyelination cuprizone model, oligodendroglial cell death and downregulation of myelin genes start days after initiation of the cuprizone diet and weeks before demyelination is obvious. In early - but not in later - stages, dying oligodendrocytes express activated caspase 3, suggesting a switch from classical apoptotic pathways to caspase 3-independent mechanisms during the course of the cuprizone diet. The expression level of FAS in the corpus callosum, a cell death receptor crucial for oligodendroglial cell death in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), correlates with the expression of activated caspase 3 in oligodendrocytes. However, mice lacking FAS in oligodendrocytes are not protected against cuprizone-induced oligodendroglial cell death, showing that FAS is dispensable for oligodendroglial cell death in the cuprizone model. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

1106,2-s2.0-85024788820,TH‐D‐201C‐03: Correlation between MR Diffusion Tensor Imaging Derived Dimensional Ellipsoid Ratio as a Function of Tissue Anisotropy and Multiple Sclerosis Induced Variation,"<p>Purpose: The diffusion fractional ellipsoids derived in ratios ((X<sub>MS</sub> −X<sub>NC</sub>)/X<sub>NC</sub>) are compared from both the Monte Carlo simulation and the deviated diffusion profile between normal brains and Secondary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis (SPMS) patients. We construct a map to evaluate the water diffusion in (1) standard sorted (2) non‐sorted and (3) normalized space of directional diffusivity and diffusion anisotropy indices. Method and Materials: The sensitivity coefficients are derived analytically between the anisotropy indices and diffusivities in the symmetric prolate λ<sub>1</sub>&gt;λ<sub>2</sub>=λ<sub>3</sub> and oblate λ<sub>1</sub>&lt;λ<sub>2</sub>=λ<sub>3</sub> diffusion and non‐symmetric geometry. The contrast‐to‐scatter ratios are calculated from the Monte Carlo simulation conducted in Matlab (MathWorks Natick MA) in addition to the mean contrast comparison of diffusion tensor derived parameter from white and gray matter of a SPMS study acquired in GE Signa 1.5T scanner with 21 gradient weighted direction scheme TR/TE=10800/80ms FOV=24cm voxel size=1×1×3 mm<sup>3</sup> matrix size = 128×128 and b = 1000 s mm<sup>−2</sup>. Statistical comparison was performed in SPSS (SPSS Inc Chicago Illinois) to determine the significant Pearson correlation and difference of both within and across diseased and normal fiber bundles. Results: The sensitivity of the diffusion anisotropy indices as expressing from a ratio of standard deviation to magnitude/average is higher than the diffusivities in low anisotropy region. The diffusion ellipsoid of low anisotropy tissue is observed to be prolonged as SNR&lt;20. The contrast‐to‐scatter ratio of FA decreases slightly with increasing anisotropy for SNR&gt;20. Conclusion: Sensitivity analysis is demonstrated as a standard to derive the dimensional ellipsoid ratio as a function of anisotropy level and tissue type. A multiple sclerosis induced oblate ratio ellipsoid was observed in both of the genu and splenium corpus callosum while prolate ratio was found in the internal capsule and thalamus. In contrast both the radial and axial diffusivity decrease in the caudate nucleus. © 2010, American Association of Physicists in Medicine. All rights reserved.</p>"
1107,2-s2.0-84931409629,Tumefactive multiple sclerosis,"<p>Non-contrast head CT is often the first study for evaluation of acute cognitive decline in the emergent setting. Tumefactive multiple sclerosis (TMS) typically shows a large area of confluent hypodensity in the periventricular white matter, often extending from the body of the corpus callosum. This area of hypodensity can extend to the subcortical white matter and, in some cases, exhibit mass effect on the neighboring ventricle, distorting the overlying cortex. While tumefactive lesions can be large enough to exhibit some mass effect, the mass effect is often less than would be expected for the size of the lesion. Post-contrast images can show subtle, discontinuous edge enhancement (Figure 12.1A). Further characterization with MRI (Figure 12.1B–E) usually reveals the characteristic imaging findings associated with TMS that differentiate it from other diseases. The confluent hypodensity seen on CT will correlate to a similar territory of intrinsic hypointensity on T1-weighted images. There will be corresponding central hyperintensity with a thin edge of hypointensity on T2-weighted images. Post-contrast MRI yields a characteristic horseshoe-shaped leading edge of enhancement that is open towards the cortex. Corresponding restriction on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) occurs in the region of enhancement (Figure 12.1F) [1, 2]. © Martin L. Gunn 2013.</p>"
1108,2-s2.0-84924720686,Active multiple sclerosis,"<p>Specific Imaging Findings Active multiple sclerosis (MS) plaques cause breakdown of the blood–brain barrier (BBB) and therefore enhancement on postcontrast MR images. Two enhancement patterns exist: uniform, reflecting the onset of a new lesion, and ringlike, indicating reactivation of an older lesion. Uniform enhancement may be faint, irregular, and with ill-defined margins. Peripheral ring-like enhancement is usually incomplete (“open”); however, it may form a full circle. There is no associated mass effect and no edema surrounding the enhancing area (except for tumefactive MS, which is discussed separately). Hyperacute plaques (first 24 h) may show restricted diffusion due to acute inflammation. On DWI acute lesions frequently show a ring pattern with hyperintense rim, while the center of the lesion has high ADC values. The diffusion findings and contrast enhancement, however, frequently do not coexist. Although MS plaques can be found throughout the brain, they have a predilection for periventricular white matter, corpus callosum, juxtacortical regions, optic radiations, as well as infra-tentorial locations. The enhancing lesions also follow this distribution. Ovoid appearance with orientation perpendicular to the ventricular surface is highly characteristic, but only on axial images. Microbleeds may be seen within MS plaques on T2* MR imaging, primarily with SWI. The detection rate of enhancing lesions is increased by delayed imaging, triple dose of contrast and use of magnetization transfer. The higher contrast dose may have a role in cases of diagnostic doubt following the standard dose. © Cambridge University Press 2012.</p>"
1109,2-s2.0-84924696933,Susac syndrome,"<p>Specific Imaging Findings MR is the imaging method of choice and shows multiple small foci of high T2 signal intensity throughout the white and gray matter, supra- and infra-tentorially. Corpus callosum is always involved. Involvement of gray matter is more apparent within the basal ganglia and thalami but also occurs in the cortex. Many lesions enhance after contrast administration during the acute and subacute periods of the disease. Leptomeningeal contrast enhancement may also be seen and as the CSF has increased proteins its signal intensity on FLAIR images may be increased. During the acute period lesions tend to show reduced ADC. A pathognomonic finding for Susac syndrome is that of rounded lesions centrally within the corpus callosum (and not at the calloso-septal interface as in multiple sclerosis). Another typical finding is “string of pearls” – the studding of the internal capsules with microinfarcts on MRI. In the chronic stage the white matter lesions may become confluent and the brain suffers generalized atrophy. Pertinent Clinical Information The classic clinical triad includes: Subacute encephalopathy, retinal artery branch occlusions and sensorineural hearing loss. Most patients are women between 20 and 40 years of age. Findings on brain MRI, audiogram, and funduscopy help reach the correct diagnosis. Unfortunately, the complete clinical triad is present in less than 5% of patients at the onset of the disease. Headache routinely accompanies the encephalopathy and may be constant, migrainous, or both. Bilateral long-tract signs commonly accompany the encephalopathy, which is laden with psychiatric features, confusion, memory loss, and other cognitive changes. It has been proposed that the diagnosis of Susac syndrome can be made when only the encephalopathy and pathognomonic MRI lesions are present. © Cambridge University Press 2012.</p>"
1110,2-s2.0-84924662776,Multiple sclerosis,"<p>Specific Imaging Findings Multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions are T2 hyperintense and primarily located in the white matter. MS plaques are of varying shapes and sizes with the classical ovoid lesions radiating perpendicular from the ventricular wall (“Dawson's fingers”). This classic appearance needs to be present on axial images. Corpus callosum lesions at the calloso-septal interface are highly suggestive of MS, as are the ones within the brainstem and middle cerebellar peduncles. Juxtacortical white matter involvement is typical, while optic radiations and optic nerves are commonly affected. Multiple discreet lesions may coalesce and become smudgy. Active MS plaques may show reduced diffusion and, more reliably, enhancement with contrast. “Black holes”, corresponding to chronic MS lesions, are very dark on T1WI, frequently with a thin peripheral bright rim, better seen with magnetization transfer. Larger demyelinating plaques show low attenuation on CT. The revised McDonald criteria require presence of at least two T2 hyperintense lesions in at least two of the four locations – juxtacortical, periventricular, infratentorial, and spinal cord, in the appropriate clinical setting. If brain MRI is not conclusive, spinal MRI may be helpful, as around 25% of patients present with isolated spinal cord lesions. Pertinent Clinical Information Patients are more commonly young females presenting with various symptoms and signs, such as tingling, numbness, weakness, fatigue, coordination and balance problems. Optic neuritis, a frequent presenting sign, is present in up to 50% of cases. CSF examination typically shows increased protein and oligoclonal bands. Symptoms can spontaneously resolve and come back or present in another part of the body. In Asian patients, the optic–spinal type is more frequent, older age group is affected, fewer cases are positive for oligoclonal bands, and total CSF protein is higher. MR imaging has an important role, excluding alternative diagnoses, and characterizing dissemination in space and time; however, it is currently not reliable for predicting the clinical disease evolution. © Cambridge University Press 2012.</p>"
1111,2-s2.0-84923422002,Whitematter,"<p>The white matter of the brain has recently assumed a prominent role in the study of brain–behavior relationships. Although recognized by neuroanatomists for centuries, and long understood by clinicians as crucial for elemental neurologic function, white matter has come to be appreciated as a major contributor to higher function by virtue of its key position within the distributed neural networks that subserve all aspects of cognition, emotion, and behavior [1–3]. Clinical and basic neuroscience advances have offered new insights into the structure and function of myelinated systems that promise to enhance our understanding of the normal brain and the many disorders that may disturb its operations and produce neurobehavioral dysfunction. This chapter presents a summary of current knowledge in this field and its implications for the future of Behavioral Neurology &amp; Neuropsychiatry (BN&amp;NP). Historical background White matter was first depicted as a neuroanatomic structure by the great anatomist Andreas Vesalius (1514–1564) in 1543 [1]. In his monumental work De Humani Corporis Fabrica, a treatise that still stands as a landmark in the history of science, Vesalius clearly demarcated the white matter from the gray in drawings of the brain made from cadavers. In the spirit of the Renaissance – the first era in which dissection of the human body was fully explored – the drawings of this book display impressive artistic as well as scientific merit, reflecting the influence of the great painter Titian on Vesalius and his co-workers [1]. Progress on the function of white matter was slower to come, but in the seventeenth century Thomas Willis (1621–1675) proposed that white matter areas including the corpus callosum elaborated sensory signals into perceptions destined to be stored in the cerebral cortex [1]. Anticipating modern systems neuroscience, Franz Joseph Gall (1758–1828), who was a highly competent neuroanatomist despite his unfortunate forays into phrenology, established in the early 1800s that white matter was comprised of fascicles that connected cortical gray matter areas devoted to mental activity [1]. Later in the nineteenth century, the neurologist Jean-Martin Charcot (1825–1893) gained well-deserved fame for advancing the understanding of white matter and its functions through the study of multiple sclerosis (MS) and similar diseases [1]. In the mid-twentieth century, Norman Geschwind (1926–1984) emphasized the importance of white matter tracts in behavioral neurology in a classic treatise on disconnection syndromes that inspired a generation of clinicians and investigators [4, 5]. © Cambridge University Press 2013.</p>"
1112,2-s2.0-78649769380,Anatomical distribution of central nervous system plaques in multiple sclerosis: An Iranian experience,"<p>Multiple Sclerosis (MS) begins most commonly in young adults and is characterized by multiple areas of Central Nervous System (CNS) white matter inflammation, demyelination and glial scarring. The most valuable laboratory aid for diagnosing MS is Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). An advanced type of MRI that exploits molecular diffusion can detect acute and active lesions. Early diagnosis and onset of treatment help to hinder disease progression. The aim of this study was to compare the findings of conventional and Diffusion-Weighted (DW) MRI in assessing the cerebral lesions of MS patients. Thirty patients with clinically definite MS (mean age 32.76±8.79 years) and an age- and sex-matched control group of 30 healthy volunteers (mean age 32.75±9.23 years) were enrolled in this 12 month descriptive-prospective survey. Both groups were subjected to conventional and DW MRI and were compared in respect of the total number, morphology, location and the mean size of the intra-cerebral MS plaques. The sensitivities and specificities of both imaging methods in detecting these plaques were determined. The conventional method revealed significantly more plaques within the brain (p&lt;0.05) and showed more ovoid lesions. More lesions were detected by the conventional method in the periventricular area, centrum semiovale and corpus callosum. The minimum plaque size was significantly lower in the conventional method group. The sensitivity of both methods was 100%. The specificities of conventional and DW MRI were 86.6 and 96.6%, respectively, so DW MRI may detect lesions that are not obvious by routine methods. © 2010 Asian Network for Scientific Information.</p>"
1113,2-s2.0-77952874753,Intercenter differences in diffusion tensor MRI acquisition,"<p>Purpose: To assess the effect on diffusion tensor (DT) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of acquiring data with different scanners. Materials and Methods: Forty-four healthy controls and 36 multiple sclerosis patients with low disability were studied using eight MR scanners with acquisition protocols that were as close to a standard protocol as possible. Between 7 and 13 subjects were studied in each center. Region-of-interest (ROI) and histogram-based analyses of fractional anisotropy (FA), axial (D<sub>ax</sub>), radial (D<sub>rad</sub>), and mean diffusivity (MD) were performed. The influence of variables such as the acquisition center and the control/patient group was determined with an analysis of variance (ANOVA) test. Results: The patient/control group explained ≈25% of data variability of FA and D<sub>rad</sub> from midsagittal corpus callosum (CC) ROIs. Global FA, MD, and Drad in the white matter differentiated patients from controls, but with lower discriminatory power than for the CC. In the gray matter, MD discriminated patients from controls (30% of variability explained by group vs. 17% by center). Conclusion: Significant variability of DT-MRI data can be attributed to the acquisition center, even when a standardized protocol is used. The use of appropriate segmentation methods and statistical models allows DT-derived metrics to differentiate patients from healthy controls. © 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.</p>"
1114,2-s2.0-77952851182,Correlation of cognitive dysfunction and diffusion tensor MRI measures in patients with mild and moderate multiple sclerosis,"<p>Purpose: To compare the diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) measures of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients and healthy subjects in every brain voxel and to correlate them with Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT) scores. Materials and Methods: Fractional anisotropy (FA), and mean, longitudinal, and transverse diffusivity are compared between control subjects and MS patients, which were subdivided as mildly and moderately impaired. In addition, PASAT scores are correlated for both MS groups with the diffusion measures. An optimized voxel based analysis (VBA) method, in terms of coregistration, atlas construction, and image smoothing, was thereby used. Results:: Diffusion differences between the control subjects and the patients with MS were found in the corpus callosum, inferior longitudinal fasciculus, cortico spinal tracts, forceps major, superior longitudinal fasciculus, and cingulum. In addition, we observed significant correlations of the FA and PASAT scores in the left inferior longitudinal fasciculus, the forceps minor, the capsula interna and externa, the genu of the corpus callosum, the left cingulum, the superior longitudinal fasciculus, and the corona radiata. Conclusion:: Diffusion differences were observed between the mildly impaired MS patients and control subjects. In addition, different diffusion measures correlated with PASAT scores for cognitive decline in parietal, frontal, as well as temporal white matter (WM) regions. © 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.</p>"
1115,2-s2.0-77951477425,Default-mode network dysfunction and cognitive impairment in progressive MS,"<p>Objective: This study explores default-mode network (DMN) abnormalities in patients with secondary progressive (SP) and primary progressive (PP) multiple sclerosis (MS) and whether such abnormalities correlate with cognitive impairment and damage to selected white matter (WM) fiber bundles, quantified using diffusion tensor (DT) MRI tractography. Methods: Resting state (RS) functional MRI and DT MRI data were acquired from 33 patients with SPMS, 24 patients with PPMS, and 24 controls. Independent component analysis (ICA) was used to identify the DMN. SPM5 was used to assess within-and between-group activations. Results: Between-group differences in DMN activity were found in the left medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), left precentral gyrus (PcG), and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Compared to controls, patients with SPMS had reduced activity in the mPFC (p = 0.01) and PcG (p = 0.02), while patients with PPMS had reduced activity in the PcG (p = 0.008) and the ACC (p = 0.002). Compared to patients with PPMS, patients with SPMS had increased ACC activity (p = 0.04). Reduction of RS activity in the ACC was more pronounced in cognitively impaired vs cognitively preserved patients with MS (p = 0.02). In patients with MS, DMN abnormalities correlated with the PASAT and word list test scores (r values ranging from 0.35 to 0.45) and DT MRI changes in the corpus callosum and the cingulum (r values ranging from 0.82 to 0.87). Conclusion: These results suggest that a dysfunction of the anterior components of the default-mode network may be among the factors responsible for the accumulation of cognitive deficits in patients with progressive multiple sclerosis.

1116,2-s2.0-77950906842,Imaging biomarkers in multiple sclerosis,"<p>Recent years have witnessed impressive advances in the use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for the assessment of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). Complementary to the clinical evaluation, conventional MRI provides crucial pieces of information for the diagnosis of MS. However, the correlation between the burden of lesions observed on conventional MRI scans and the clinical manifestations of the disease remains weak. The discrepancy between clinical and conventional MRI findings in MS is explained, at least partially, by the limited ability of conventional MRI to characterize and quantify the heterogeneous features of MS pathology. Other quantitative MR-based techniques, however, have the potential to overcome such a limitation of conventional MRI. Indeed, magnetization transfer MRI, diffusion tensor MRI, proton MR spectroscopy, and functional MRI are contributing to elucidate the mechanisms that underlie injury, repair, and functional adaptation in patients with MS. Such techniques are likely to benefit from the use of high-field MR systems and thus allow in the near future providing additional insight into all these aspects of the disease. This review summarizes how MRI is dramatically changing our understanding of the factors associated with the accumulation of irreversible disability in MS and highlights the reasons why they should be used more extensively in studies of disease evolution and clinical trials. © 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.</p>"

1118,2-s2.0-75749126994,"Tract-based analysis of callosal, projection, and association pathways in pediatric patients with multiple sclerosis: A preliminary study","<p>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Region-of-interest (ROI) and tract-based diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) analyses have detected increased apparent diffusion coefficients (ADCs) and decreased fractional anisotropy (FA) in callosal and projection systems of adult patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). We explored whether similar changes occur in pediatric patients with MS, assessing 3 major white matter pathways (interhemispheric, projection, and intrahemispheric) in both visibly involved and normalappearing white matter (NAWM). MATERIALS AND METHODS: DTI datasets from 10 patients with established pediatric MS and 10 age-sex-,and imaging technique - matched controls were analyzed. Tracts were reconstructed by using a fiber assignment by continuous tracking algorithm with a diffusion-weighted imaging mask and a 35° angular threshold. Tracts were selected by using standard ROI placements on color FA maps cross-referenced to b = 0 T2-weighted images for studying white matter pathways. Ten identical ROIs were placed in NAWM on b = 0 T2-weighted images to ensure that both ROIs and resulting tracts passed through NAWM. RESULTS: In pediatric MS, all tracts had higher mean ADC values (P = .002 to P &lt; .04) and lower mean FA (P = .009 to P &lt; .02) than those in healthy controls. Even when the tracts were confined to NAWM, the mean ADC was higher (P &lt; .004 to P &lt; .05) and the mean FA was lower (P = .002 to P &lt; .02). T2 lesion burden correlated with tract-based mean ADC. ROI mean ADC increased, and both tract and ROI mean FA decreased with increasing T2 lesion burden, however with a statistically nonsignificant correlation. CONCLUSIONS: Increased mean ADC and decreased mean FA occur in all 3 major white matter pathways, both in visibly involved white matter and NAWM in pediatric MS.</p>"

Materials and Methods: This prospective HIPAA-compliant study was approved by the institutional review board. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants. In this study, 34 consecutive patients (21 women, 13 men; mean age, 31.7 years ± 7.7 [standard deviation]) who presented with CIS were recruited. The magnetic resonance (MR) examination included dual-echo fast spin-echo, three-dimensional T1, and diffusion-tensor imaging. Sixteen matched healthy volunteers served as control subjects. T2 lesion volumes were assessed with a semiautomatic technique. VBM and TBSS were used for the GM and WM analyses, respectively, to compare regional GM volumes and fractional anisotropy (FA) values in the two groups. Results: TBSS analysis revealed a pattern of diffuse FA reductions in patients with CIS at the cluster level (P &lt; .05). Regions of decreased FA involved most of the WM pathways, including the corticospinal tracts, corpus callosum, and superior and inferior longitudinal fasciculi. There were no significant differences between the two groups in terms of global GM, WM, or cerebrospinal fluid volume or in terms of regional GM volume. Conclusion: Diffuse WM damage not accompanied by any change in GM or WM volume is observed in patients with CIS. This suggests that WM involvement plays a relevant role in the early phases of MS. Subsequently detected GM damage may be secondary to WM alterations. © RSNA, 2009.</p>"
1120,2-s2.0-73949102202,A voxel-based morphometry study of disease severity correlates in relapsing- remitting multiple sclerosis,"<p>Previous studies have shown a preferential loss of grey matter in fronto-temporal regions in patients with multiple sclerosis. Studies of correlates of disease severity are more controversial, because some studies have suggested an association between sensorimotor cortex atrophy and Expanded Disability Status Scale score, while others did not find such a correlation. The objective of this study was to assess the correlation of regional loss of grey matter and white matter with indexes of clinical and radiological severity in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis, including the Expanded Disability Status Scale and lesion load. Correlations between Expanded Disability Status Scale, lesion load and disease duration were assessed in 128 patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (Expanded Disability Status Scale range 1.0-6.0) using optimized voxel-based morphometry. Bilateral loss of grey matter in sensorimotor cortices was correlated with Expanded Disability Status Scale, and tissue loss also involved adjacent white matter, extending along pyramidal tracts to the brainstem. Increasing lesion load was correlated with loss of deep grey matter and white matter. No specific region of grey matter or white matter showed a significant correlation with disease duration. These findings support the hypothesis that motor neuron involvement plays a major role in the progression of physical disability. Lesion load accrual affects mainly highly interconnected subcortical structures, while disease duration has a less significant impact on brain atrophy, probably owing to the inter-subject heterogeneity of the clinical course of the disease.</p>"
1121,2-s2.0-70449528528,Functional recovery of callosal axons following demyelination: a critical window,"<p>Axonal dysfunction as a result of persistent demyelination has been increasingly appreciated as a cause of functional deficit in demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis. Therefore, it is crucial to understand the ultimate causes of ongoing axonal dysfunction and find effective measures to prevent axon loss. Our findings related to functional deficit and functional recovery of axons from a demyelinating insult are important preliminary steps towards understanding this issue. Cuprizone diet for 3-6 wks triggered extensive corpus callosum (CC) demyelination, reduced axon conduction, and resulted in loss of axon structural integrity including nodes of Ranvier. Replacing cuprizone diet with normal diet led to regeneration of myelin, but did not fully reverse the conduction and structural deficits. A shorter 1.5 wk cuprizone diet also caused demyelination of the CC, with minimal loss of axon structure and nodal organization. Switching to normal diet led to remyelination and restored callosal axon conduction to normal levels. Our findings suggest the existence of a critical window of time for remyelination, beyond which demyelinated axons become damaged beyond the point of repair and permanent functional loss follows. Moreover, initiating remyelination early within the critical period, before prolonged demyelination-induced axon damage ensues, will improve functional axon recovery and inhibit disease progression.</p>"
1122,2-s2.0-72449188688,Transplanted neural precursors enhance host brain-derived myelin regeneration,"<p>In multiple sclerosis lesions resident oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) are present, but fail to remyelinate. In the current study we examined whether neural precursor cell (NPC) transplantation can facilitate host brain-derived remyelination. We used the chronic cuprizone-induced demyelination model in aged mice, in which slow remyelination follows cuprizone removal. NPCs were transplanted to the lateral ventricles (intracerebroventricular) of cuprizone-induced demyelinated brains. In this experimental setup, transplanted cells remained mostly in the periventricular area in an undifferentiated state. The extent of demyelination, remyelination, and proliferation of host brain regenerative cell population were examined at 1 week posttransplantation in the splenium of the corpus callosum, which was devoid of any transplanted cells. Transplantation of NPCs, but not of control, human embryonic kidney cells, significantly enhanced remyelination compared with sham-operated mice. Remyelination was performed exclusively by host brain OPCs. The proregenerative effect of transplanted NPCs was related to an increase in the proliferation of host brain OPCs. To examine the mechanism that underlies the proregenerative effect of NPCs in vitro, we used an NPC-OPC coculture system. These experiments indicated that NPCs induced the proliferation of OPCs and facilitated their differentiation into mature oligodendrocytes. The mitogenic effect of NPCs was mediated by platelet-derived growth factor-AA and fibroblast growth factor-2. In conclusion, NPC transplantation enhances host-derived myelin regeneration following chronic demyelination. This trophic effect may stimulate resident OPCs to overcome the remyelination failure in multiple sclerosis. Copyright © 2009 Society for Neuroscience.</p>"

In addition, cuprizone treatment can be ended to allow more direct analysis of remyelination than with viral or autoimmune models. However, CC demyelination lacks a useful functional correlate in rodents for longitudinal analysis throughout the course of demyelination and remyelination. In the present study, we tested two distinct behavioural measurements in mice fed 0.2% cuprizone. Running on a 'complex' wheel with varied rung intervals requires integration between cerebral hemispheres for rapid bilateral sensorimotor coordination. Maximum running velocity on the 'complex' wheel decreased during acute (6 week) and chronic (12 week) cuprizone demyelination. Running velocity on the complex wheel distinguished treated (for 6 weeks) from non-treated mice, even after a 6-week recovery period for spontaneous remyelination. A second behavioural assessment was a resident-intruder test of social interaction. The frequency of interactive behaviours increased among resident mice after acute or chronic demyelination. Differences in both sensorimotor coordination and social interaction correlated with demonstrated CC demyelination. The wheel assay is applicable for longitudinal studies. The resident-intruder assay provides a complementary assessment of a distinct modality at a specific time point. These behavioural measurements are sufficiently robust for small cohorts as a non-invasive assessment of demyelination to facilitate analysis of subsequent remyelination. These measurements may also identify CC involvement in other mouse models of central nervous system injuries and disorders. © 2009 The Author(s).</p>"

Methods: This is a prospective, observational and longitudinal study of patients with SD. The study took place In a third-level medical center during the period from September 2007 to May 2008. Strabismological exploration, multidisciplinary diagnosis and treatment alternatives were analyzed. Results: Ten patients presenting SD were studied. Diagnoses were multiple sclerosis, arteriovenous malformation, epilepsy, hydrocephalus, ischemic encephalopathy, cortical atrophy, hypoplasia of corpus callosum and thalamic hemorrhage. Psychomotor retardation was present in 80%, Other diagnoses were Cogan apraxia, Parinaud syndrome, see-saw nystagmus, Foville syndrome, and hemiplegie alterations. Related strabismuses were exotropia (5), esotropia (3), hypertropia (2), and dissociated vertical deviation (1). Lesions of II, III and VII cranial nerves were found. Conclusions: Complete strabological study allows a better diagnosis of the lesion and consequently relapsing disease in order to achieve a better treatment according to each patient. Optical rehabilitation and botulinum applications are especially indicated.</p>"

1128,2-s2.0-73349094994,Comparison of MRI signatures in pattern I and II multiple sclerosis models,"<p>The majority of individuals with multiple sclerosis (MS) exhibit T-cell- and macrophage-dominated lesions (patterns I and II; as opposed to III and IV). These lesions, in turn, may be distinguished on the basis of whether or not there are immunoglobulin and complement depositions at the sites of active myelin destruction; such depositions are found exclusively in pattern II lesions. The main aim of this study was to determine whether pattern I and pattern II MS lesions exhibit distinct MRI signatures. We have used a recently described focal MOG-induced EAE model of the rat brain, which recapitulates many of the hallmarks of pattern II MS; we compared this with our previous work in a delayed type hypersensitivity model of a pattern I type lesion in the rat brain. Demyelinating lesions with extensive inflammation were generated, in which the T2-weighted signal was increased. Magnetisation transfer ratio (MTR) maps revealed loss and subsequent incomplete recovery of the structure of the corpus callosum, together with changes in tissue water diffusion and an associated increase in ventricle size. Notably, the MTR changes preceeded histological demyelination and may report on the processes leading to demyelination, rather than demyelination per se. Immunohistochemically, these MRI-detectable signal changes correlated with both inflammatory cell infiltration and later loss of myelin. Breakdown of the blood-brain barrier and an increase in the regional cerebral blood volume were also evident in and around the lesion site at the early stage of the disease. Interestingly, however, the MRI signal changes in this pattern II type MS lesion were remarkably consistent with those previously observed in a pattern I lesion. These findings suggest that the observed signal changes reflect the convergent histopathology of the two models rather than the underlying mechanisms of the disease.

1129,2-s2.0-70949100119,In vivo quantification of myelin changes in the vertebrate nervous system,"<p>Destruction or changes associated with myelin membranes in the CNS play a key role in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis and other related neurodegenerative disorders. Along-standing goal has been to detect and quantify myelin content in vivo. For this reason,wehave developed a myelin-imaging technique based on positron emission tomography (PET). PET is a quantitative imaging modality that has been widely used in clinical settings for direct assessment of biological processes at the molecular level. However, lack of myelin-imaging probes has hampered the use of PET for imaging of myelination in the CNS. Here, we report a myelin-imaging agent, termed Case Imaging Compound (CIC) that readily penetrates the blood-brain barrier and preferentially localizes to myelinated regions of the brain. After radiolabeling with positron-emitting carbon-11, [ <sup>11</sup>C]CIC-PET was conducted in longitudinal studies using a lysolethicin-induced rat model of focal demyelination and subsequent remyelination. Quantitative analysis showed that the retention of [ <sup>11</sup>C]CIC correlates with the level of demyelination/remyelination. These studies indicate that, for the first time, [ <sup>11</sup>C]CIC-PET can be used as an imaging marker of myelination, which has the potential to be translated into clinical studies in multiple sclerosis and other myelin-related diseases for early diagnosis, subtyping, and efficacy evaluation of therapeutic treatments aimed at myelin repair.

1130,2-s2.0-70349780437,Sexual dimorphism in the white matter of rodents,"<p>Sexual dimorphism of astrocytes and neurons is well documented in many brain and spinal cord structures. Sexual dimorphism of oligodendrocytes (Olgs) and myelin has received less attention. We recently showed that density of Olgs in corpus callosum, fornix, and spinal cord of wild-type male rodents is more densely packed than in females; myelin proteins and myelin gene expression are likewise greater in males than in female rodents. However, glial cell proliferation and cell death were two times greater in female corpus callosum. Endogenous sex hormones, specifically lack of androgens, produce an Olg female phenotype in castrated male mouse. In vitro studies using Olgs culture also showed differences between males and females Olg survival and signaling pathways in response to sexual hormones. Sexual dimorphism of white matter tracts and glia in rodents indicates the necessity for controlling gender in the experimental studies of neurodegenerative disorders. Most importantly, our studies suggest that hormones may contribute to sexual dimorphism observed in certain human diseases including multiple sclerosis. © 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.</p>"
1131,2-s2.0-70349762450,Gender differences in the histopathology of MS?,"<p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions are histopathologically characterized by inflammation, demyelination/remyelination, axonal damage and gliosis. Animal experimental and in vitro studies suggest that sex hormones influence the immune system and contribute to the increased likelihood in women of developing MS. However, a variety of studies have also shown that remyelination is more marked in female rodents or that female sex hormones are beneficial for myelin repair. To determine whether gender influences the histopathology of MS lesions, we compared the extent of inflammation, axonal damage and remyelination in MS lesions of female and male MS patients. We observed no differences in the composition of inflammatory infiltrates, axonal damage or cortical pathology. Similar numbers of oligodendroglial progenitor cells and mature oligodendrocytes were present in MS lesions. Remyelination is slightly, but not significantly, more extensive in women than men in early MS lesions. The absence of significant differences in lesion pathology between female and male MS patients might be explained by a lack of a gender influence, but also might be due to the limited number of tissue samples available for histopathological analysis. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Each subject also underwent a MRI scan to measure the midsagittal callosal area (MICA) and midline internal skull surface (MISS) for calculating a callosal atrophy index (MICA/MISS). Callosal lesion localization and the degree of white matter changes on MRI were also noted for the diseased patients. Test performance of the MS patients were statistically different from the control subjects (p&lt;0.0001). Especially, tests on writing to dictation, cross-replication of hand postures and bimanuel motor coordination were found sensitive. Strikingly, callosal dysfunction was detected even without any visible corpus callosum lesion. There was no correlation between the test performance and the callosal atrophy or white matter involvement. © Universitätsverlag Ulm GmbH 2009.</p>"

A narrative review,"<p>Objective: Although several studies have confirmed the occurrence of gray-matter abnormalities in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), the literature on white matter in OCD is more limited. In this study, we reviewed the role of white-matter abnormalities in the pathophysiology of OCD. METHOD:: We reviewed the PubMed studies investigating white-matter integrity in patients with OCD between 1980 and 2010. Results: Case studies of patients who developed obsessive-compulsive symptoms secondary to multiple sclerosis, cerebrovascular diseases, and paraneoplastic leucoencephalopathy and controlled studies of patients with OCD examined with neuroimaging techniques (eg, structural, diffusion, and spectroscopic magnetic resonance imaging) were all consistent with the existence of abnormalities in specific white-matter tracts (eg, internal capsule, cingulate bundle, and corpus callosum) of individuals with OCD. Conclusions: Our review emphasizes that the reported white-matter alterations in OCD complement the broader gray-matter abnormalities identified and may well suggest that OCD is associated with large-scale disruption in brain systems or networks, as opposed to being a consequence of disturbances in isolated brain regions. © 2010 by Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins.</p>"
1134,2-s2.0-70349909335,Regional white matter atrophy - Based classification of multiple sclerosis in cross-sectional and longitudinal data,"<p>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The different clinical subtypes of multiple sclerosis (MS) may reflect underlying differences in affected neuroanatomic regions. Our aim was to analyze the effectiveness of jointly using the inferior subolivary medulla oblongata volume (MOV) and the cross-sectional area of the corpus callosum in distinguishing patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS), secondary-progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS), and primary-progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS). MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed a cross-sectional dataset of 64 patients (30 RRMS, 14 SPMS, 20 PPMS) and a separate longitudinal dataset of 25 patients (114 MR imaging examinations). Twelve patients in the longitudinal dataset had converted from RRMS to SPMS. For all images, the MOV and corpus callosum were delineated manually and the corpus callosum was parcellated into 5 segments. Patients from the cross-sectional dataset were classified as RRMS, SPMS, or PPMS by using a decision tree algorithm with the following input features: brain parenchymal fraction, age, disease duration, MOV, total corpus callosum area and areas of 5 segments of the corpus callosum. To test the robustness of the classification technique, we applied the results derived from the cross-sectional analysis to the longitudinal dataset. RESULTS: MOV and central corpus callosum segment area were the 2 features retained by the decision tree. Patients with MOV &gt;0.94 cm<sup>3</sup> were classified as having RRMS. Patients with progressive MS were further subclassified as having SPMS if the central corpus callosum segment area was &lt;55.12 mm<sup>2</sup>, and as having PPMS otherwise. In the cross-sectional dataset, 51/64 (80%) patients were correctly classified. For the longitudinal dataset, 88/114 (77%) patient time points were correctly classified as RRMS or SPMS. CONCLUSIONS: Classification techniques revealed differences in affected neuroanatomic regions in subtypes of multiple sclerosis. The combination of central corpus callosum segment area and MOV provides good discrimination among patients with RRMS, SPMS, and PPMS.</p>"

Materials and Methods: Diffusion weighted scans were performed and apparent diffusion coefficients of 12 regions of interest were determined in 30 MS patients, 21 neurosarcoid patients, and 4 ADEM patients. Results: Mean apparent diffusion coefficients were significantly higher in MS patients than in non-MS patients in 6 of 6 of the corpus callosal regions assessed but not in any of the non-callosal white or gray matter regions assessed. Conclusion: Elevated apparent diffusion coefficients within the corpus callosum on diffusion weighted imaging may potentially help differentiate between patients with MS and patients with other diseases affecting the central nervous system white matter. © 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.</p>"
1136,2-s2.0-69249103797,A multiparametric evaluation of regional brain damage in patients with primary progressive multiple sclerosis,"<p>The purpose of this study is to define the topographical distribution of gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) damage in patients with primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS), using a multiparametric MR-based approach. Using a 3 Tesla scanner, dual-echo, 3D fast-field echo (FFE), and diffusion tensor (DT) MRI scans were acquired from 18 PPMS patients and 17 matched healthy volunteers. An optimized voxel-based (VB) analysis was used to investigate the patterns of regional GM density changes and to quantify GM and WM diffusivity alterations of the entire brain. In PPMS patients, GM atrophy was found in the thalami and the right insula, while mean diffusivity (MD) changes involved several cortical-subcortical structures in all cerebral lobes and the cerebellum. An overlap between decreased WM fractional anisotropy (FA) and increased WM MD was found in the corpus callosum, the cingulate gyrus, the left short temporal fibers, the right short frontal fibers, the optic radiations, and the middle cerebellar peduncles. Selective MD increase, not associated with FA decrease, was found in the internal capsules, the corticospinal tracts, the superior longitudinal fasciculi, the fronto-occipital fasciculi, and the right cerebral peduncle. A discrepancy was found between regional WM diffusivity changes and focal lesions because several areas had DT MRI abnormalities but did not harbor T2-visible lesions. Our study allowed to detect tissue damage in brain areas associated with motor and cognitive functions, which are known to be impaired in PPMS patients. Combining regional measures derived from different MR modalities may be a valuable tool to improve our understanding of PPMS pathophysiology. © 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.</p>"
1137,2-s2.0-67649948190,17β-Estradiol and progesterone prevent cuprizone provoked demyelination of corpus callosum in male mice,"<p>Sex hormones, for example, estrogen and progesterone, are thought to affect and delay progression of multiple sclerosis (MS) in pregnant women. Although both steroid hormones are neuroprotective in the brain and elevated during pregnancy, only estrogen was tested in clinical trials. To evaluate the role of 17β-estradiol (E) and progesterone (P) in prevention demyelination, young adult male mice were fed with cuprizone for a defined time interval and simultaneously treated with steroids by repeated injections into the neck region. The status of myelination was analyzed by magnetic resonance imaging and conventional histological staining. The individual application of E and P resulted only in a moderate prevention of demyelination in the corpus callosum (CC). The combined treatment with both steroid hormones counteracted the process of demyelination. Expression of the mature (PLP and MBP) and premature (PDGF-α-R) oligodendrocyte markers were significantly increased after hormone application in the affected CC. In addition, both hormones stimulated astrogliosis and the expression of IGF-1. Microglial invasion in demyelinated CC was pronounced and additionally localized in the midline of CC after hormone treatment. These data show that sex steroids can protect the brain from demyelination and stimulate remyelination. It appears that only the administration of both hormones is fully effective. The beneficial steroid effect requires interactions with oligodendrocytes possibly by preventing their degeneration or recruitment from precursor cells which are stimulated to remyelinated fibers. The positive hormonal influence on myelination in the CNS may be a future therapeutically strategy for the treatment of MS. © 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.</p>"
1138,2-s2.0-70449472801,Selective reduction in microglia density and function in the white matter of colony-stimulating factor-1-deficient mice,"<p>It is still debated whether microglia play a beneficial or harmful role in myelin disorders such as multiple sclerosis and leukodystrophies as well as in other pathological conditions of the central nervous system. The osteopetrotic (op/op) mouse has reduced numbers of cells of monocyte lineage as a result of an inactivating mutation in the colony stimulating factor-1 gene. To determine whether this mutant mouse might be used to study the role of microglia in myelin disorders, we quantified the number of microglia in the central nervous system of op/ op mice and explored their ability to respond to brain injury created by a stab wound. Microglial density in the 2-month-old op/op mice was significantly decreased in the white matter tracts compared with the -ge matched wild-type controls (by 63.6% in the corpus callosum and 86.4% in the spinal dorsal column), whereas the decrease was less in the gray matter, cerebral cortex (24.0%). A similar decrease was seen at 7 months of age. Morphometric studies of spinal cord myelination showed that development of myelin was not affected in op/op mice. In response to a stab wound, the increase in the number of microglia/macrophages in op/op mice was significantly less pronounced than that in wild-type control. These findings demonstrate that this mutant is a valuable model in which to study roles of microglia/ macrophages in the pathophysiology of myelin disorders. © 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.</p>"
1139,2-s2.0-70350569249,Characterization of the normal appearing white matter in multiple sclerosis by diffusion tensor imaging,"<p>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) became an essential paraclinical examination tool for Multiple Sclerosis (MS) diagnosis and patient care. It shows the inflammatory aspect of the disease that could be quantified by measuring the lesion load. However, conventional MRI can not predict the evolution of MS. Therefore, we propose to evaluate new physiopathological markers using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in order to quantify different tissue diffusivity parameters such as the mean diffusivity (MD), the fractional anisotropy (FA), the axial (λa) and radial (λr) diffusivities. Measuring these parameters in two normal appearing white matter (NAWM) regions namely the corpus callosum (CC) and the semi-oval white matte region (WMs), showed significant alterations in MS patients with differences in between the clinical forms. Among these results, one must note that the large increase in radial diffusivity is probably a sensitive marker of myelin impairment. Moreover, these diffusivity changes are correlated with the lesion load, which shows the importance of this factor in the assessment of inflammatory processes. Finally, DTI is a sensitive tool for the physiopathological characterization of MS that may provide new markers for a better understanding of the clinical evolution of the patient and adjusting the therapeutic approach. © 2009 Elsevier Masson SAS.

1140,2-s2.0-69049106378,Lower fractional anisotropy at the anterior body of the normal-appearing corpus callosum in multiple sclerosis versus symptomatic carotid occlusion,"<p>Introduction: Not uncommonly, differentiating multiple sclerosis (MS) from ischemic cerebral vascular disease is difficult based on conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We aim to determine whether preferential occult injury in the normal-appearing corpus callosum (NACC) is more severe in patients with MS than symptomatic carotid occlusion by comparing fractional anisotropy (FA) from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Methods: Eighteen patients (eight men, ten women; mean age, 38.6 years) with MS and 32 patients (24 men, eight women; mean age, 64.0 years) with symptomatic unilateral internal carotid occlusion were included. DTI (1.5 T) were performed at corpus callosum which were normal-appearing on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery MRI. Mean FA was obtained from the genu, anterior body, posterior body, and splenium of NACC. Independent-sample t test statistical analysis was performed. Results: The FA values in various regions of NACC were lower in the MS patients than symptomatic carotid occlusion patients, which was statistically different at the anterior body (0.67±0.12 vs 0.74±0.06, P=0.009), but not at genu, posterior body, and splenium (0.63±0.09 vs 0.67±0.07, P=0.13; 0.68±0.09 vs 0.73±0.05, P=0.07; 0.72±0.09 vs 0.76±0.05, P=0.13). Conclusion: MS patients have lower FA in the anterior body of NACC compared to patients with symptomatic carotid occlusion. It suggests that DTI has potential ability to differentiate these two conditions due to the more severe preferential occult injury at the anterior body of NACC in MS. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.</p>"
1141,2-s2.0-67651115860,Regional differences between grey and white matter in cuprizone induced demyelination,"<p>Cuprizone feeding is a commonly used model to study experimental de- and remyelination, with the corpus callosum being the most frequently investigated white matter tract. We have previously shown that demyelination is also extensive in the cerebral cortex in the cuprizone model. In the current study, we have performed a detailed analysis of the dynamics of demyelination in the cortex in comparison to the corpus callosum. Prominent and almost complete demyelination in the corpus callosum was observed after 4.5-5 weeks of 0.2% cuprizone feeding, whereas complete cortical demyelination was only observed after 6 weeks of cuprizone feeding. Interestingly, remyelination in the corpus callosum occurred even before the termination of cuprizone administration. Accumulation of microglia in the corpus callosum started as early as week 3 reaching its maximum at week 4.5 and was still significantly elevated at week 6 of cuprizone treatment. Within the cortex only a few scattered activated microglial cells were found. Furthermore, the intensity of astrogliosis, accumulation of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells and nestin positive cells differed between the two areas investigated. The time course and dynamics of demyelination differ in the corpus callosum and in the cortex, suggesting different underlying pathomechanisms. © 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.</p>"

Patients showed a significant progressive loss of posterior CC areas (isthmus and splenium) related to increasing EDSS scores and an enhancing right ear advantage (REA) over time. A significant correlation between posterior CC areas and DL scores emerged in both evaluations, being negative for the right and positive for the left ear. The pattern of correlations suggests that the CC can serve an inhibitory and also excitatory influence on the contralateral hemisphere when studying the phonological processing of language. Statement of significance to the neuroscience of language: The scope of the manuscript is language lateralization. The task used in the experiment is a verbal dichotic listening task, tapping the most basic phonological aspects of language.

Design: Retrospective analysis of features of first brain MRI available at MS onset in patients with pediatriconset and adult-onset MS. Setting: A pediatric and an adult MS center. Patients: Patients with pediatric-onset &lt;18 years) and adult-onset (≥18 years) MS. Main Outcome Measures: Weevaluated initial and second (when available) brain MRI scans obtained at the time of firstMSsymptoms for lesions that were T2-bright, ovoid and well defined, large (≥1cm), or enhancing. Results: We identified 41 patients with pediatric-onset MS and 35 patients with adult-onset MS. Children had a higher number of total T2- (median, 21 vs 6; P&lt;.001) and large T2-bright areas (median, 4 vs 0; P&lt;.001) than adults. Children more frequently had T2-bright foci in the posterior fossa (68.3% vs 31.4%; P=.001) and enhancing lesions (68.4% vs 21.2%; P&lt;.001) than adults. On the second brain MRI, children had more new T2-bright (median, 2.5 vs 0; P&lt;.001) and gadolinium-enhancing foci (P&lt;.001) than adults. Except for corpus callosum involvement, race/ethnicity was not strongly associated with disease burden or lesion location on the first scan, although other associations cannot be excluded because of the width of the confidence intervals. Conclusion: While it is unknown whether the higher disease burden, posterior fossa involvement, and rate of new lesions in pediatric-onset MS are explained by age alone, these characteristics have been associated with worse disability progression in adults. ©2009 American Medical Association.

1144,2-s2.0-67650489029,Abnormal connectivity of the sensorimotor network in patients with MS: A multicenter fMRI study,"<p>In this multicenter study, we used dynamic causal modeling to characterize the abnormalities of effective connectivity of the sensorimotor network in 61 patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) compared with 74 age-matched healthy subjects. We also investigated the correlation of such abnormalities with findings derived from structural MRI. In a subgroup of subjects, diffusion tensor (DT) MRI metrics of the corpus callosum and the left corticospinal tract (CST) were also assessed. MS patients showed increased effective connectivity relative to controls between: (a) the left primary SMC and the left dorsal premotor cortex (PMd), (b) the left PMd and the supplementary motor areas (SMA), (c) the left secondary sensorimotor cortex (SII) and the SMA, (d) the right SII and the SMA, (e) the left SII and the right SII, and (f) the right SMC and the SMA. MS patients had relatively reduced effective connectivity between the left SMC and the right cerebellum. No interaction was found between disease group and center. Coefficients of altered connectivity were weakly correlated with brain T2 LV, but moderately correlated with DT MRI-measured damage of the left CST. In conclusion, large multicenter fMRI studies of effective connectivity changes in diseased people are feasible and can facilitate studies with sample size large enough for robust outcomes. Increased effective connectivity in the patients for the simple motor task suggests local network modulation contributing to enhanced long-distance effective connectivity in MS patients. This extends and generalizes previous evidence that enhancement of effective connectivity may provide an important compensatory mechanism in MS. © 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.</p>"

Cognitive impairment is one of the factors affecting quality of life of patientswith benignMS (BMS). The aimof this study was to investigate the relationship between the cognitive profile of BMS patients and the extent of tissue damage in the CC. Brain conventional and DTMRI scans were acquired from 54BMS patients and 21 healthy controls. Neuropsychological tests (NPT) exploring memory, attention, and frontal lobe cognitive domains were administered to the patients. DT tractography was used to calculate themean diffusivity (MD) and fractional anisotropy (FA) of the CC normal appearing white matter (NAWM). An index of CC atrophy was also estimated. Nine (17%) BMS patients fulfilled criteria for cognitive impairment. Compared with controls, BMS had significantly different CC diffusivity and volumetry (P &lt; 0.001). Compared with cognitively preserved patients, those with CI had significantly higher CC lesion volume (LV) (P = 0.02) andNAWMMD(P = 0.02). The scores obtained at PASAT were significantly correlated withCCT2 LV, andNAWMFA andMD(r values ranging from20.31 to 0.66, P values ranging from0.04 to &lt;0.001). Cognitive impairment inBMS is associated with the extent of CC damage in terms of both focal lesions and diffuse fiber bundle injury. MRI assessment of topographical distribution of tissue damage may represent a rewarding strategy for understanding the subtle clinical deficits of patients with BMS. ©2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.</p>"
1146,2-s2.0-67649613550,Is a Reversible Splenial Lesion a Sign of Encephalopathy?,"<p>A reversible splenial lesion of the corpus callosum has been recognized in patients with mild encephalitis/encephalopathy associated with various infectious diseases. All reported cases of encephalitis/encephalopathy, by definition, present with neurologic signs, many of which involve seizures or mildly altered states of consciousness, such as drowsiness. We report an 8-year-old boy with influenza A infection not associated with neurologic signs, whose brain magnetic resonance images incidentally revealed a reversible splenial lesion in the corpus callosum. This case indicates that a transient splenial lesion in the corpus callosum may occur during a febrile illness, without neurologic manifestations. Therefore, physicians should not diagnose or treat a patient as encephalopathic merely because of the presence of a splenial lesion on magnetic resonance imaging. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

We tested a novel pulse sequence to determine whether 3 T MRI spin-spin relaxometry detected damage in NAWM of MS patients (n = 13) vs. age-matched normal controls [(NL) (n = 11)]. Baseline characteristics of the MS group were: age (mean ± SD) 42.5 ± 5.4 (range 33-51 years), disease duration 9.0 ± 6.4 (range 1-22 years), Expanded Disability Status Scale score 2.5 ± 1.7 (range 1-6.5). Brain MRI measures, obtained at 3 T, included global and regional NAWM transverse relaxation rate [R2 (= 1 / T2)], derived from 3D fast spin-echo T2 prepared images, and global white matter volume fraction derived from SPGR images. The regional NAWM areas investigated were the frontal lobe, parietal lobe, and the genu and splenium of the corpus callosum. Mean NAWM R2 was lower (indicating T2 prolongation) in MS than NL in the whole brain (p = 0.00047), frontal NAWM (p = 0.00015), parietal NAWM (p = 0.0069) and callosal genu (p = 0.0019). Similarly, R2 histogram peak position was lower in NAWM in MS than NL in the whole brain (p = 0.019). However, the normalized WM volume fractions were similar in both MS and NL (p &gt; 0.1). This pilot study suggests that a novel 3D fast spin-echo pulse sequence at 3 T, used to derive R2 relaxation maps, can detect tissue damage in the global and regional cerebral NAWM of MS patients that is missed by conventional lesion and atrophy measures. Such findings may represent demyelination, inflammation, glial proliferation and axonal loss. © 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.</p>"
1151,2-s2.0-66949143968,SJL mice exposed to cuprizone intoxication reveal strain and gender pattern differences in demyelination,"<p>The role of mouse strain and the influence of gender on demyelination were explored for the first time in SJL mice using the cuprizone intoxication model. We document here that SJL mice display a unique pattern of demyelination that did not follow the profile that is well-characterized in C57BL/6 mice. The SJL mice did not readily demyelinate at the midline within the corpus callosum but showed greater demyelination immediately lateral to midline. During continuous exposure to cuprizone, demyelination was not complete and appeared to plateau after week 7. Importantly, female mice were partially resistant to demyelination, whereas male mice were more severely demyelinated. Differences in the number of mature oligodendrocytes were consistent with the extent of demyelination; however, microglia, astrocyte and oligodendrocyte precursor cell populations did not differ between male and female mice. Thus, genetic factors and gender influence susceptibility to demyelinating disease in the cuprizone model, which may provide additional insights into the variability observed in human demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis. © 2008 International Society of Neuropathology.</p>"
1152,2-s2.0-66149168702,Occurrence of acute large and edematous callosal lesions in neuromyelitis optica,"<p>Background: The corpus callosum is commonly involved in multiple sclerosis (MS), but the characteristics of callosal lesions in neuromyelitis optica (NMO) are unknown. Objective: To reveal the features of callosal lesions in NMO in comparison to MS. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records and the brain magnetic resonance imaging films of 56 patients with MS and 22 patients with NMO. Results: In MS, 36 (64.3%) of 56 patients had callosal lesions, but only four patients had acute lesions. All such acute lesions were small, isolated and non-edematous, and the intensity was homotonic. Chronic lesions were observed in 34 patients with MS, and 32 (94%) of them presented small lesions located at the callosal lower margin (""hemi-oval pattern""). Meanwhile, four (18.2%) patients with NMO had callosal lesions, and three of them had acute lesions. Those acute lesions were multiple, large edematous ones with heterogeneous intensity (""marbled pattern""). In the chronic stage, the lesions shrank or disappeared. Conclusions: Acute large, edematous callosal lesions occasionally occur in NMO. Similar to longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis, such callosal lesions may reflect severe edematous inflammation in NMO, and may provide additional evidence that the pathogenesis in NMO is different from that in MS.</p>"

Methods: Retrospective review of prospective database of 106 lesions in 91 consecutive patients undergoing FB stereotactic needle biopsy with a systematic ""geologic core"" technique by a single surgeon. Diagnostic accuracy was calculated comparing biopsy diagnosis with final pathology in 11 patients who underwent subsequent surgical resection. All instances of intra-operative bleeding through the needle were prospectively noted and compared with post-biopsy CT scan. Lesions were classified as risky for FL technique if they were (1) infratentorial or pineal, (2) within 10 mm of the circle of Willis or root of the Sylvian fissure, or (3) within 10 mm of deep cerebral veins. Results: Diagnostic yield was 94%. Diagnostic accuracy was 91%. Of 18 lesions involving the corpus callosum, 13 (72.2%) were GBM 2 were anaplastic astrocytoma, and 1 each were found to be anaplastic oligodendroglioma, primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) and tumescent MS. Of 25 multifocal lesions, malignant primary brain tumor was diagnosed in 17 (68%) (11 GBM, 3 PCNSL, 2 anaplastic ologodendroglioma, and 1 anaplastic astrocytoma). Mortality was 0%. Three patients developed temporary neurologic deficits and one had permanent deficit. Absence of persistent blood through the biopsy needle had a negative predicative value of 98.8% for subsequent neuroimaging blood &gt;5 mm diameter. According to our criteria, 80% of patients would have been candidates for FL biopsy. Conclusions: Stereotactic biopsy is an effective, safe and important technique for histologic diagnosis of brain lesions, particularly for multifocal and corpus callosum lesions. Post-biopsy CT can be safely reserved for patients who demonstrate persistent bleeding through the biopsy needle. FB stereotaxy remains an important technique for the 20% with small or deep seated lesions or when it is advantageous to avoid an incision, a burr hole or general anesthesia. © The Author(s) 2009.</p>"

1157,2-s2.0-65549100690,Systemic inflammatory response reactivates immune-mediated lesions in rat brain,"<p>The potential association between microbial infection and reactivation of a multiple sclerosis (MS) lesion is an important issue that remains unresolved, primarily because of the absence of suitable animal models and imaging techniques. Here, we have evaluated this question in an empirical manner using immunohistochemistry and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), before and after the induction of a systemic inflammatory response in two distinct models of MS. In a pattern-II-type focal myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein-experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis model, systemic endotoxin injection caused an increase in regional cerebral blood volume (rCBV) around the lesion site after 6 h, together with a reduction in the magnetization transfer ratio of the lesioned corpus callosum. These changes were followed by an increase in the diffusion of tissue water within the lesion 24 h after endotoxin challenge and new leukocyte recruitment as revealed both immunohisto chemically and by MRI tracking of ultra small superparamagnetic iron oxide-labeled macrophages. Importantly, we detected in vivo expression of E- and P-selectin in quiescent lesions by MRI-detectable glyconano-particles conjugated to sialyl Lewis <sup>x</sup>. This finding may explain, at least in part, the ability of quiescent MS lesions to rapidly reinitiate the cell recruitment processes. In a pattern-I-type delayed-type hypersensitivity response model, a similar effect of endotoxin challenge on rCBV was observed, together with delayed breakdown of the blood-brain barrier, showing that systemic infection can alter the patho-genesis of MS-like lesions regardless of lesion etiology. These findings will have important implications for the management and monitoring of individuals with MS. Copyright © 2009 Society for Neuroscience.</p>"
1158,2-s2.0-61849169991,Fatigue in multiple sclerosis is associated with the disruption of frontal and parietal pathways,"<p>Background: Fatigue is one of the most frequent and disturbing symptoms in multiple sclerosis (MS), directly affecting the patient's quality of life. However, many questions remain unclear regarding the anatomic brain correlate of MS-related fatigue. Objective: To assess the relationship between fatigue and white matter lesion location and gray matter atrophy. Methods: In this study, 60 patients with MS were evaluated with the Modified Fatigue Impact Scale and magnetic resonance imaging. Location of white matter lesion was analyzed using a voxel-by-voxel lesion probability mapping approach and gray matter atrophy degree and location using an optimized voxel-based morphometry method. Results: We found a correlation between lesion load and fatigue score (T2 lesion load: r = 0.415, P = 0.001; T1 lesion load r = 0.328, P = 0.011). Moreover, fatigue correlated with lesions in the right parietotemporal (periatrial area, juxtaventricular white matter deep in the parietal lobe and callosal forceps) and left frontal (middle-anterior corpus callosum, anterior cingulum and centrum semiovale of the superior and middle frontal gyri) white matter regions (P &lt; 0.001 in all cases). Finally, fatigue score significantly correlated with gray matter atrophy in frontal regions, specifically, the left superior frontal gyrus and bilateral middle frontal gyri (P &lt; 0.001 in all cases). Conclusion: Our results suggest that the symptom of fatigue is associated with a disruption of brain networks involved in cognitive/ attentional processes. © SAGE Publications 2009.</p>"
1159,2-s2.0-58149288078,Regional DTI differences in multiple sclerosis patients,"<p>Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) measures have shown to be sensitive to white matter (WM) damage in multiple sclerosis (MS), not only inside focal lesions but also in user-defined regions in the so-called normal-appearing white matter (NAWM). New analysis techniques for DTI measures are now available that allow for hypothesis-free localization of damage. We performed DTI measurements of 30 MS patients selected for low focal lesion loads, and of 31 age-matched healthy controls and analyzed these using tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS). Patients were found to have a lower fractional anisotropy (FA) compared to controls in a number of brain regions, including the fornices, the left corona radiata, the inferior longitudinal fasciculus in both hemispheres, both optic radiations, and parts of the corpus callosum. In the regions of reduced FA, an increase in radial diffusivity and a less pronounced increase of axial diffusivity were found. Neurocognitive assessment showed that patients had normal visuospatial memory performance, just-normal attention, and impaired processing speed; the latter was associated with abnormal FA in the corpus callosum, an area which was relatively devoid of lesions visible on proton density-weighted images in our patients. TBSS can be useful in future studies with other MS patient samples to provide an unbiased localization of damage and generate location-specific hypotheses. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

1161,2-s2.0-58249127253,Demyelination of the hippocampus is prominent in the cuprizone model,"<p>In multiple sclerosis demyelination not only affects the white matter, but also the grey matter of the brain. We have previously reported that in the murine cuprizone model for demyelination lesions occur in addition to the corpus callosum also in the neocortex and hippocampus. In the current study, we provide a detailed characterization of hippocampal demyelination in the cuprizone model. Male C57BL/6 mice were challenged with 0.2% cuprizone for 6 weeks. Defined structures within the hippocampus were investigated at week 0 (control), 3, 4, 4.5, 5, 5.5, and 6. Demyelination affected all hippocampal structures analyzed and was complete after 6 weeks of cuprizone treatment. Between the distinct hippocampal structures the temporal pattern of demyelination varied considerably. Furthermore, infiltration of activated microglia as well as astrogliosis was detected. In summary, cuprizone feeding provides a useful model for studying demyelination processes in the mouse hippocampus. © 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.</p>"

Recent developments of DT MR imaging postprocessing techniques, such as tractography and voxelwise analysis, are likely to improve our understanding of the mechanisms associated with the accumulation of disability in MS.

1163,2-s2.0-85049117016,Remyelination failure in multiple sclerosis and vulnerability of oligodendrocytes to repeated insults,"<p>Oligodendrocytes (OL) synthesize myelin sheaths that insulate axons, forming the main components of the central nervous system (CNS) white matter. The considerable importance of this structure is well underlined by the fact that its lesions occuring during Multiple Sclerosis (MS) result often in patients severe disability. Permanent neurological deficit relies on axonal lesions that are associated with demyelination, and the remyelination process is impaired, for yet unknown reasons. To get insight into these pathophysiological phenomenons we have analyzed the capability of OL to synthesize myelin in MS chronic lesions. A constant and pronounced decrease in the number of myelinated fibres per OL compared to the adjacent normal appearing white matter (NAWM) was observed (Fressinaud, 2007). This suggests that, at the cellular level, OL are incapable of synthesizing an appropriate number of myelin sheaths. Thus, restricted metabolic capacities of OL could result in their failure to remyelinate a sufficient number of damaged fibres, and might represent an important mechanism in MS, since, conversely, the number of OL is less constantly decreased. This hypothesis was supported by two sets of experimental data in vivo, and in vitro. In vivo, rat corpus callosum demyelination by lysophosphatidyl choline (LPC) stereotaxic microinjection is followed by spontaneous remyelination, and this process is significantly accelerated by treatment with either platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) (Allamargot et al., 2001), or neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) (Jean et al., 2003). As expected, given the known proliferative effect of these growth factors on OL progenitors (Besnard et al., 1987; Barres et al., 1994), the number of OL increased by 20% in NT-3 remyelinated lesions compared to animals receiving LPC only, and, more interestingly, the number of myelinated fibres per cell increased far more, up to 100%, compared to spontaneous remyelination. Thus, these results strengthen the hypothesis that a more efficient remyelination relies not only on the availability of a sufficient pool of myelinating OL, but also, individually, on an increased capability of OL to synthesize myelin sheaths in large amounts, and that this ability too might be partly lost in MS. Since MS often evolves on a remitting-relapsing pattern, the repetition of attacks could represent one of the main factors that account for the failure of OL to remyelinate adequately lesions; nevertheless, the consequences for OL of repeated insults were largely unknown. In order to mimic this schematically, we have constructed an in vitro paradigm in which OL from newborn rat brain, grown in pure cultures, were submitted to either a single exposure to LPC (2.10<sup>-5</sup> M, 24 h) (Fressinaud and Vallat, 1994), or to several LPC exposures, although for shorter periods and at lower concentration (0.5 10<sup>-5</sup> M, 4 × 6 h). Indeed, OL were very susceptible to multiple attacks versus a single one (despite a similar total dose and duration of treatment), and in particular mature OL - which are the myelinating cells, and constitute the major part of the population of cells of the OL lineage in the adult CNS -. Mature OL might thus represent the principal target of relapses during MS (Fressinaud, 2005). Taken together our results converge, and suggest that cells of the OL lineage are particularly vulnerable to multiple insults, which lead both to the death of numerous cells and to restricted capability to synthesize myelin by surviving OL. This defect could constitute one of the significant causes contributing to their failure to remyelinate axons in MS. Our data add to the accumulating scientific knowledge suggesting that early treatment and attempts to avoid relapses are needed for patients suffering from MS. © 2009 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.</p>"
1164,2-s2.0-77950972803,Atlas-based vs. individual-based deterministic tractography of corpus callosum in multiple sclerosis,"<p>Diffusion tensor (DT) magnetic resonance imaging is able to quantify tissue microstructure properties and to detect pathological changes even in the normal appearing tissues. DT sequence parameters which provide optimal SNR and minimum acquisition time, and an individual-based tractography post-processing allowed corpus callosum tractography even in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients also with no need of a-priori atlas. In this preliminary study, we were able to obtain reliable individual-based tractography in 28/30 MS patients. DT-derived indices computed in tracks obtained with individual-based tractography were able to differentiate healthy volunteers from MS patients better than the same indices computed with the atlas method. This indicates that such an optimized sequence may be a reliable tool to be used in future MS studies. ©2009 IEEE.</p>"

1166,2-s2.0-73349119953,Callosal lesion predicts future attacks after clinically isolated syndrome,"<p>BACKGROUND: Current MRI criteria can help predict a second attack after a clinically isolated syndrome (CIS). Given the known association between corpus callosum lesions (CC) and multiple sclerosis (MS), such lesions on MRI could provide additional predictive information. This study assessed whether the presence of CC lesion on MRI could, next to the modified Barkhof criteria, further enhance prediction of conversion from CIS to MS. METHODS: Follow-up study of 158 patients with CIS who underwent MRI after CIS was performed. MRI were scored for the Barkhof criteria and CC lesion. Patients were classified as having MS according to Poser criteria. Cox regression models were used for the time to conversion from CIS to MS. RESULTS: The Barkhof criteria and CC lesion were strongly associated with conversion to MS with hazard ratios (HR), respectively, of 2.6 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.5-4.3) and 2.7 (95% CI 1.6-4.5). The HRs of CC lesion adjusted for the Barkhof criteria and the Barkhof criteria adjusted for CC lesion were similar (HRs 1.8, not significant). The combined prediction of the Barkhof criteria and CC lesion was 3.3 (95% CI 1.9-5.7). Patients not fulfilling the Barkhof criteria had a fourfold increased risk of MS (HR 3.8, 95% CI 1.5-9.3) when they had a lesion in the CC. CONCLUSIONS: Corpus callosum (CC) lesion and the Barkhof criteria both predicted conversion to multiple sclerosis (MS). When both variables were combined, the association was stronger. The assessment of CC lesion may be a useful additional tool for predicting conversion to MS in patients with clinically isolated syndrome. © 2009 by AAN Enterprises, Inc.</p>"

1168,2-s2.0-68549107850,Tissue-specific imaging is a robust methodology to differentiate in vivo T1 black holes with advanced multiple sclerosis-induced damage,"<p>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Brains of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) characteristically have ""black holes"" (BHs), hypointense lesions on T1-weighted (T1W) spin-echo (SE) images. Although conventional MR imaging can disclose chronic BHs (CBHs), it cannot stage the degree of their pathologic condition. Tissue-specific imaging (TSI), a recently introduced MR imaging technique, allows selective visualization of white matter (WM), gray matter (GM), and CSF on the basis of T1 values of classes of tissue. We investigated the ability of TSI-CSF to separate CBHs with longer T1 values, which likely represent lesions containing higher levels of destruction and unbound water. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighteen patients with MS, who had already undergone MR imaging twice (24 months apart) on a 1.5T scanner, underwent a 3T MR imaging examination. Images acquired at 1.5T included sequences of precontrast and postcontrast T1W SE, T2-weighted (T2W) SE, and magnetization transfer (MT). Sequences obtained at 3T included precontrast and postcontrast T1W SE, T2W SE, T1 inversion recovery prepared fast spoiled gradient recalled-echo (IR-FSPGR) and TSI. A BH on the 3T-IR-FSPGR was defined as a CBH if seen as a hypointense, nonenhancing lesion with a corresponding T2 abnormality for at least 24 months. CBHs were separated into 2 groups: those visible as hyperintensities on TSI-CSF (group A), and those not appearing on the TSI-CSF (group B). RESULTS: Mean MT ratios of group-A lesions (0.22 ± 0.06, 0.13-0.35) were lower (F <sub>1,13</sub> = 60.39; P &lt; .0001) than those of group-B lesions (0.32 ± 0.03, 0.27-0.36). CONCLUSIONS: Group-A lesions had more advanced tissue damage; thus, TSI is a potentially valuable method for qualitative and objective identification.</p>"
1169,2-s2.0-65649133589,Statin therapy inhibits remyelination in the central nervous system,"<p>Remyelination of lesions in the central nervous system contributes to neural repair following clinical relapses in multiple sclerosis. Remyelination is initiated by recruitment and differentiation of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) into myelinating oligodendrocytes. Simvastatin, a blood-brain barrier-permeable statin in multiple sclerosis clinical trials, has been shown to impact the in vitro processes that have been implicated in remyelination. Animals were fed a cuprizone-supplemented diet for 6 weeks to induce localized demyelination in the corpus callosum; subsequent return to normal diet for 3 weeks stimulated remyelination. Simvastatin was injected intraperitoneally during the period of coincident demyelination and OPC maturation (weeks 4 to 6), throughout the entire period of OPC responses (weeks 4 to 9), or during the remyelination-only phase (weeks 7 to 9). Simvastatin treatment (weeks 4 to 6) caused a decrease in myelin load and both Olig2<sup>strong</sup> and Nkx2.2 <sup>strong</sup> OPC numbers. Simvastatin treatment (weeks 4 to 9 and 7 to 9) caused a decrease in myelin load, which was correlated with a reduction in Nkx2.2<sup>strong</sup> OPCs and an increase in Olig2<sup>strong</sup> cells, suggesting that OPCs were maintained in an immature state (Olig2 <sup>strong</sup>/Nkx2.2<sup>weak</sup>). NogoA+ oligodendrocyte numbers were decreased during all simvastatin treatment regimens. Our findings suggest that simvastatin inhibits central nervous system remyelination by blocking progenitor differentiation, indicating the need to monitor effects of systemic immunotherapies that can access the central nervous system on brain tissuerepair processes.

1171,2-s2.0-57449088363,"Effects of dietary intervention on MRI activity, de- and remyelination in the cuprizone model for demyelination","<p>Whether differences in diet composition may influence demyelinating diseases remains controversial. The aim of this study was to analyse if diets with a different composition of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) could influence demyelination and remyelination in cuprizone fed mice, a widely used animal model for de- and remyelination. C57Bl/6 mice were fed with 0.2% cuprizone on three different diets. The diets consisted of the same ingredients, except the lipid source, which came from 1) salmon fillets rich in marine n - 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), 2) cod liver oil rich in marine n - 3 PUFAs, or 3) a control diet containing soybean oil rich in n - 6 PUFAs. After 5 weeks of cuprizone treatment, the mice given salmon-cuprizone had significantly less hyperintense lesion volume on brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) than the two other groups (P &lt; 0.0005). After 6 weeks of cuprizone treatment, the salmon-cuprizone group had less demyelination in the corpus callosum, as measured with luxol fast blue (LFB) (P &lt; 0.0005) and anti-proteolipid protein (PLP) (P = 0.014). The salmon-cuprizone group also had enhanced remyelination compared to the cod liver oil-cuprizone group (LFB; P = 0.003, PLP; P = 0.018). This study indicates that a fish rich diet may offer a protective role in demyelination. The source of N - 3 PUFAs, or other components in the fish, may be important, as no effect of a cod liver oil based diet was observed. This may be of importance related to the discrepant results in dietary intervention studies for demyelinating diseases. © 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.</p>"
1172,2-s2.0-56349106487,"Gene expression analysis of normal appearing brain tissue in an animal model for multiple sclerosis revealed grey matter alterations, but only minor white matter changes","<p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS). Recent studies suggest that, beside focal lesions, diffuse inflammatory and degenerative processes take place throughout the MS brain. Especially, molecular alterations in the so-called normal appearing white matter suggest the induction of neuroprotective mechanisms against oxidative stress preserving cellular homeostasis and function. In this study we investigated whether in an animal model for MS, namely in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), similar changes occur. We isolated normal appearing white and grey matter from the corpus callosum and the above lying cerebral cortex from DA rats with rMOG-induced EAE and carried out a gene expression analysis. Examination of corpus callosum revealed only minor changes in EAE rats. In contrast, we identified a number of gene expression alterations in the cerebral cortex even though morphological and cellular alterations were not evident. One of the most striking observations was the downregulation of genes involved in mitochondrial function as well as a whole set of genes coding for different glutamate receptors. Our data imply that molecular alterations are present in neurons far distant to inflammatory demyelinating lesions. These alterations might reflect degenerative processes induced by lesion-mediated axonal injury in the spinal cord. Our results indicate that the MOG-induced EAE in DA rats is a valuable model to analyze neuronal alterations due to axonal impairment in an acute phase of a MS-like disease, and could be used for development of neuroprotective strategies. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

1173,2-s2.0-58149237714,Quantitative in vivo magnetic resonance imaging of multiple sclerosis at 7 Tesla with sensitivity to iron,"<p>Objective: Magnetic resonance imaging at 7 Tesla produces high-resolution gradient-echo phase images of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) that quantify the local field shifts from iron in the basal ganglia and lesions. Phase imaging is easily integrated into clinical examinations because it is a postprocessing technique and does not require additional scanning. The purpose of this study was to quantify local field shifts in MS and to investigate their relation to disease duration and disability status. Methods: Thirty-two subjects including 19 patients with MS and 13 age-and sex-matched control subjects were scanned at a spatial resolution of up to 195 x 260μm. Data were postprocessed to produce anatomical quantitative phase images of local field shifts, as well as conventional magnitude images. Results: The phase images showed an increased local field in the caudate, putamen, and globus pallidus of patients relative to control subjects ( p &lt; 0.01). The local field in the caudate was strongly correlated with disease duration (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.77; p &lt; 0.001). Phase images showed contrast in 74% of the 403 lesions, increasing the total lesion count by more than 30% and showing distinct peripheral rings and a close association with vasculature. Interpretation: The increased field in the basal ganglia and correlation with disease duration suggest pathological iron content increases in MS. The peripheral phase rings are consistent with histological data demonstrating iron-rich macrophages at the periphery of a subset of lesions. The clearly defined vessels penetrating MS lesions should increase our ability to detect focal vascular abnormalities specifically related to demyelinating processes. © 2008 American Neurological Association. .

1174,2-s2.0-54449100137,A case of Fabry disease with central nervous system (CNS) demyelinating lesions: A double trouble?,"<p>We present the case of a 36-year-old woman affected with Fabry disease (FD), with neuroradiologic and laboratory tests suggestive of a coexistent inflammatory demyelinating disease. Since the age of 23, she presented recurrent neurologic deficits, such as right limb paresthesias, diplopia, and right leg weakness. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed multiple demyelinating lesions in periventricular areas, corpus callosum, and spinal cord. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis showed the presence of oligoclonal bands, while visual-evoked potentials were delayed with preserved morphology. FD is usually considered as a differential diagnosis of multiple sclerosis, but we think that the best explanation of all pathological features in this case is the coexistence of the two diseases. © SAGE Publications 2008.</p>"
1175,2-s2.0-55949130305,Diffusion in brain extracellular space,"<p>Diffusion in the extracellular space (ECS) of the brain is constrained by the volume fraction and the tortuosity and a modified diffusion equation represents the transport behavior of many molecules in the brain. Deviations from the equation reveal loss of molecules across the blood-brain barrier, through cellular uptake, binding, or other mechanisms. Early diffusion measurements used radiolabeled sucrose and other tracers. Presently, the real-time iontophoresis (RTI) method is employed for small ions and the integrative optical imaging (IOI) method for fluorescent macromolecules, including dextrans or proteins. Theoretical models and simulations of the ECS have explored the influence of ECS geometry, effects of dead-space microdomains, extracellular matrix, and interaction of macromolecules with ECS channels. Extensive experimental studies with the RTI method employing the cation tetramethylammonium (TMA) in normal brain tissue show that the volume fraction of the ECS typically is ∼20% and the tortuosity is ∼1.6 (i.e., free diffusion coefficient of TMA is reduced by 2.6), although there are regional variations. These parameters change during development and aging. Diffusion properties have been characterized in several interventions, including brain stimulation, osmotic challenge, and knockout of extracellular matrix components. Measurements have also been made during ischemia, in models of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, and in human gliomas. Overall, these studies improve our conception of ECS structure and the roles of glia and extracellular matrix in modulating the ECS microenvironment. Knowledge of ECS diffusion properties is valuable in contexts ranging from understanding extrasynaptic volume transmission to the development of paradigms for drug delivery to the brain.

1177,2-s2.0-57749090482,Lupoid sclerosis (multiple sclerosis with systemic lupus erythematosus). Description of two cases,"<p>Two cases are described of a rare syndrome, defined as lupoid sclerosis, which refers to patients fulfilling ACR criteria for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), who develop, in the course of their disease, the clinical picture of multiple sclerosis (MS). Case 1: A 56 year-old woman, with a history of a transient polyarthritis in 1990, presented with malaise, arthralgia and myalgia in 1995. She had ANA, thrombocytopenia, leukocytopenia, low C4 levels and typical LB-test. Despite many therapeutic trials with corticosteroids, hydroxychlorokine and cyclophosphamide, the patient developed transient visual loss, tremor, weakness of upper and lower extremities, muscular hypertonia, paresthesia, urinary incontinence and diplopia, within three years (1996-1998). Several symptoms subsequently improved. Brain MRI showed multiple, widespread T2 hypersignals in the central and the deep periventricular white matter, in 1997. Case 2: A 32 year-old woman presented with fever and sensimotor deficit of several peripheral nerves in 1984. She had ANA, anti-dsDNA and low CH50. Brain CT showed no evidences of a pathologic process. In spite of many therapeutic trials with corticosteroids and azathioprine, in 1988 she presented glomerulonephritis with hypertension and had a stroke in 1990. A renal biopsy in 1991 showed evidence of glomerulosclerosis and interstitial nephritis. The patient presented with urinary incontinence in 1993, and right hemiplegia, unsteadiness, diplopia, oligoarthritis and rash in 1998. Brain MRI showed multiple foci of T2 hypersignals in the pons, basal ganglia, periventricular white matter and in the corpus callosum. These cases could be an example of initial SLE followed by clinical and MRI findings of CNS demyelination. However, one cannot exclude the probability of the coexistence of two diseases (SLE and MS) with shared symptoms and findings.</p>"

1179,2-s2.0-48549087974,Spontaneous low-frequency blood oxygenation level-dependent fluctuations and functional connectivity analysis of the 'resting' brain,"<p>Functional magnetic resonance imaging techniques using the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) contrast are widely used to map human brain function by relating local hemodynamic responses to neuronal stimuli compared to control conditions. There is increasing interest in spontaneous cerebral BOLD fluctuations that are prominent in the low-frequency range (&lt;0.1 Hz) and show intriguing spatio-temporal correlations in functional networks. The nature of these signal fluctuations remains unclear, but there is accumulating evidence for a neural basis opening exciting new avenues to study human brain function and its connectivity at rest. Moreover, an increasing number of patient studies report disease-dependent variation in the amplitude and spatial coherence of low-frequency BOLD fluctuations (LFBF) that may afford greater diagnostic sensitivity and easier clinical applicability than standard fMRI. The main disadvantage of this emerging tool relates to physiological (respiratory, cardiac and vasomotion) and motion confounds that are challenging to disentangle requiring thorough preprocessing. Technical aspects of functional connectivity fMRI analysis and the neuroscientific potential of spontaneous LFBF in the default mode and other resting-state networks have been recently reviewed. This review will give an update on the current knowledge of the nature of LFBF, their relation to physiological confounds and potential for clinical diagnostic and pharmacological studies. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

1180,2-s2.0-48849098294,Callosal function in MS patients with mild and severe callosal damage as reflected by diffusion tensor imaging,"<p>In this study, callosal function was behaviourally tested in MS patients with a redundant stimuli task. Reaction times to uni- and bilateral visual stimuli are recorded. Normal subjects respond faster to bilateral than to unilateral stimuli. This effect is called the redundancy gain effect. In patients with agenesis of the corpus callosum, the redundancy gain exceeds that predicted by probability summation, suggesting a mediating influence of the corpus callosum in healthy controls. The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of callosal damage on the redundancy gain in MS patients by investigating the probability summation model. Seventeen MS patients and as many matched healthy controls performed the redundancy gain task. In order to objectify callosal damage in our MS group, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) derived measures such as fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) in the corpus callosum were obtained. Callosal FA and MD significantly differed in our MS group compared to the healthy controls, indicating pathological callosal involvement. Since the amount of callosal damage was highly variable within the MS group, the MS cohort was split into a low and a high callosal-injured group as quantified by FA. The high FA group performed like the healthy controls, whereas violations of the probability (race) model were found for the low FA group. We conclude that behavioural measures obtained by the redundancy gain paradigm reflect callosal pathology in MS as measured by DTI. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.</p>"

To better understand the pathogenesis of this injury and the associated atrophy, we investigated volume loss over time in 20 WM fiber tracts. We defined two main aims: (1) to examine whether certain fiber tracts were more prone to atrophy, and to test the possible relation of tract atrophy to tract length and selected MS-specific variables; and (2) to investigate the possible relation of atrophy to lesion load (whole brain and in the specific tract). Local volume change was assessed between two distant time points for each MS patient studied. Fiber tracts were segmented automatically using a tractography-based atlas. Results demonstrate volume loss in all fiber tracts. The uncinate fasciculus and anterior-thalamic radiation had the greatest yearly percentage atrophy. Disease type, duration, median expanded disability status scale, total lesion load, and gender exhibited significant effects on atrophy in at least one tract. Together, these data are more consistent with a pathogenesis for the degeneration related to diffuse inflammation rather than the secondary effects of focal lesions. © SAGE Publications 2008.</p>"
1184,2-s2.0-45449120954,The corpus callosum in dichotic listening studies of hemispheric asymmetry: A review of clinical and experimental evidence,"<p>The dichotic listening paradigm using verbal stimulus material typically yields a right ear advantage (REA) which indicates the left-hemisphere dominance for speech processing. Although this interpretation is widely accepted, the cerebral hemispheres also interact through the corpus callosum. Moreover, the two most influential theoretical models of dichotic listening, the structural and the attentional model, both refer to the functional integrity of the corpus callosum, when explaining the REA. However, the current review of the available data reveals several aspects that can not be explained by the dichotic listening models. For example, an individual's ability to direct attention to either ear is mediated by callosal fibers. Consequently, the corpus callosum not only has to be considered as a channel for the automatic exchange of information between the cerebral hemispheres, it rather allows for a dynamic and flexible interaction in supporting both bottom-up and top-down stimulus processing. The review has also revealed how inter-individual variability in callosal fiber structure affects both bottom-up and top-down performance on the dichotic listening task. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

1185,2-s2.0-44949108213,Resting state sensorimotor functional connectivity in multiple sclerosis inversely correlates with transcallosal motor pathway transverse diffusivity,"<p>Recent studies indicate that functional connectivity using low-frequency BOLD fluctuations (LFBFs) is reduced between the bilateral primary sensorimotor regions in multiple sclerosis. In addition, it has been shown that pathway-dependent measures of the transverse diffusivity of water in white matter correlate with related clinical measures of functional deficit in multiple sclerosis. Taken together, these methods suggest that MRI methods can be used to probe both functional connectivity and anatomic connectivity in subjects with known white matter impairment. We report the results of a study comparing anatomic connectivity of the transcallosal motor pathway, as measured with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and functional connectivity of the bilateral primary sensorimotor cortices (SMC), as measured with LFBFs in the resting state. High angular resolution diffusion imaging was combined with functional MRI to define the transcallosal white matter pathway connecting the bilateral primary SMC. Maps were generated from the probabilistic tracking employed and these maps were used to calculate the mean pathway diffusion measures fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), longitudinal diffusivity 〈λ<sub>1</sub>〉, and transverse diffusivity 〈λ<sub>2</sub>〉. These were compared with LFBF-based functional connectivity measures (F<sub>c</sub>) obtained at rest in a cohort of 11 multiple sclerosis patients and ∼10 age- and gender-matched control subjects. The correlation between 〈FA〉 and F<sub>c</sub> for MS patients was r = -0.63, P &lt; 0.04. The correlation between all subjects 〈λ<sub>2</sub>〉 and F<sub>c</sub> was r = 0.42, P &lt; 0.05. The correlation between all subjects 〈λ<sub>2</sub> and F <sub>c</sub> was r = -0.50, P &lt; 0.02. None of the control subject correlations were significant, nor were 〈FA〉, 〈λ <sub>1</sub>, or 〈MD〉 significantly correlated with F<sub>c</sub> for MS patients. This constitutes the first in vivo observation of a correlation between measures of anatomic connectivity and functional connectivity using spontaneous LFBFs. © 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.</p>"
1186,2-s2.0-46749090850,Inhibition of p53 transcriptional activity: A potential target for future development of therapeutic strategies for primary demyelination,"<p>Oligodendrogliopathy, microglial infiltration, and lack of remyelination are detected in the brains of patients with multiple sclerosis and are accompanied by high levels of the transcription factor p53. In this study, we used the cuprizone model of demyelination, characterized by oligodendrogliopathy and microglial infiltration, to define the effect of p53 inhibition. Myelin preservation, decreased microglial recruitment, and gene expression were observed in mice lacking p53 or receiving systemic administration of the p53 inhibitor pifithrin-α, compared with untreated controls. Decreased levels of lypopolysaccharide-induced gene expression were also observed in vitro, in p53<sup>-/-</sup> primary microglial cultures or in pifithrin-α-treated microglial BV2 cells. An additional beneficial effect of lack or inhibition of p53 was observed in Sox2+ multipotential progenitors of the subventricular zone that responded with increased proliferation and oligodendrogliogenesis. Based on these results, we propose transient inhibition of p53 as a potential therapeutic target for demyelinating conditions primarily characterized by oligodendrogliopathy.

Methods: T1 weighted MR images of sagittal from thirty-seven patients with remitting-relapsing multiple sclerosis and another thirty-seven volunteers matched with age and gender were selected. Regions of interest (ROI) from three callosal parts, genu, body and splenium, were extracted from normal appearance corpus callosum individually and correspondingly divided into three sections, each with MS group and control group. All of the images were mapped into gray level co-occurrence matrix and then texture characteristics of energy, inverse difference moment and entropy were calculated in order to test the significance between two groups. Results: The values of energy and inverse difference moment in genu and splenium of corpus callosum in MS groups were significantly higher than that in control groups with all the four directions, 0°, 45°, 90° and 135° and the value of entropy were reversed(P&lt;0.05) spontaneously with significance. The value of inverse difference moment of MS group was significantly higher than that of the controls in the body part with the direction of 0°, 45° and 135° (P&lt;0.05). Conclusion: Significant differences of texture characters on T1 weighted MR image in sagittal are existed between MS groups and the controls, especiallly in the parts of genu and splenium.

1188,2-s2.0-42949163922,The cuprizone model for demyelination,"<p>Background - Important advances in multiple sclerosis (MS) research have been made as a direct or indirect result of experiments in animal models for the disease, although MS is a disease only affecting humans. The cuprizone model is a model for toxic demyelination. In this model, young mice are fed with the copper chelator cuprizone, leading to oligodendrocyte death and a subsequent reversible demyelination. Spontaneous remyelination can be seen as early as 4 days after withdrawal of cuprizone. Materials and methods - This article reviews previous research on this model and discusses the potential of the model for future application in MS research. Discussion - The cuprizone model correlates with newer histopathological data in MS and is a valuable tool for studies on de- and remyelination. The use of the C57BL/6 strain offers the potential for future studies on transgene and knockout mice. Copyright © 2008 The Authors.</p>"
1189,2-s2.0-42449128329,Impairment of movement-associated brain deactivation in multiple sclerosis: Further evidence for a functional pathology of interhemispheric neuronal inhibition,"<p>Motor control demands coordinated excitation and inhibition across distributed brain neuronal networks. Recent work has suggested that multiple sclerosis (MS) may be associated with impairments of neuronal inhibition as part of more general progressive impairments of connectivity. Here, we report results from a prospective, multi-centre fMRI study designed to characterise the changes in patients relative to healthy controls during a simple cued hand movement task. This study was conducted at eight European sites using 1.5 Tesla scanners. Brain deactivation during right hand movement was assessed in 56 right-handed patients with relapsing-remitting or secondary progressive MS without clinically evident hand impairment and in 60 age-matched, healthy subjects. The MS patients showed reduced task-associated deactivation relative to healthy controls in the pre- and postcentral gyri of the ipsilateral hemisphere in the region functionally specialised for hand movement control. We hypothesise that this impairment of deactivation is related to deficits of transcallosal connectivity and GABAergic neurotransmission occurring with the progression of pathology in the MS patients. This study has substantially extended previous observations with a well-powered, multicentre study. The clinical significance of these deactivation changes is still uncertain, but the functional anatomy of the affected region suggests that they could contribute to impairments of motor control. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.</p>"
1190,2-s2.0-43549095228,Anterior periventricular linear lesions in optic-spinal multiple sclerosis: A combined neuroimaging and neuropathological study,"<p>There are two distinct subtypes of multiple sclerosis (MS) in Asians, optic-spinal (OSMS) and conventional (CMS). In OSMS, severe spinal cord lesions are characteristic while brain lesions are scant. We sought to clarify atypical brain lesions in OSMS by neuroimaging and pathological studies. For brain MRI, 124 consecutive Japanese patients with clinically definite MS based on Poser criteria were enrolled, 57 with OSMS and 67 with CMS. Ten autopsied cases (seven OSMS and three CMS) were studied pathologically. Although the frequency of brain lesions fulfilling Barkhof criteria was significantly higher in CMS than in OSMS, periventricular linear lesions along with the anterior portion of the corpus callosum and the lateral ventricles were significantly more common in OSMS than in CMS. Pathologically, periventricular lesions in CMS extended deeply into the white matter, while those in OSMS were confined to periventricular areas. T cell infiltration in lesions was prominent in CMS but not in OSMS. Although severe axonal loss and cavity formation were commonly seen in periventricular and spinal cord lesions in OSMS, lymphocytic infiltrates and vessel wall thickening were observed only in the latter. Thus, we suggested that anterior periventricular linear lesions without ovoid ones are characteristic of OSMS. © 2008 SAGE Publications.</p>"
1191,2-s2.0-41149111439,Neuroaxonal ion dyshomeostasis of the normal-appearing corpus callosum in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis,"<p>Atrophy of the corpus callosum (CC) is a well-documented observation in clinically definite multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. One recent hypothesis for the neurodegeneration that occurs in MS is that ion dyshomeostasis leads to neuroaxonal damage. To examine whether ion dyshomeostasis occurs in the CC during MS onset, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) was utilized as an animal MS model to induce autoimmunity-mediated responses. To date, in vivo investigations of neuronal ion homeostasis has not been feasible using traditional neuroscience techniques. Therefore, the current study employed an emerging MRI method, called Mn<sup>2+</sup>-enhanced MRI (MEMRI). Mn<sup>2+</sup> dynamics is closely associated with important neuronal activity events, and is also considered to be a Ca<sup>2+</sup> surrogate. Furthermore, when injected intracranially, Mn<sup>2+</sup> can be used as a multisynaptic tracer. These features enable MEMRI to detect neuronal ion homeostasis within a multisynaptic circuit that is connected to the injection site. Mn<sup>2+</sup> was injected into the visual cortex to trace the CC, and T1-weighted imaging was utilized to observe temporal changes in Mn<sup>2+</sup>-induced signals in the traced pathways. The results showed that neuroaxonal functional changes associated with ion dyshomeostasis occurred in the CC during an acute EAE attack. In addition, the pathway appeared normal, although EAE-induced immune-cell infiltration was visible around the CC. The findings suggest that ion dyshomeostasis is a major neuronal aberration underlying the deterioration of normal-appearing brain tissues in MS, supporting its involvement in neuroaxonal functioning in MS. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

1192,2-s2.0-41149091296,Epileptic seizures and hippocampal damage after cuprizone-induced demyelination in C57BL/6 mice,"<p>Epileptic seizures are known to occur in different animal models of demyelination and have also been described in demyelinating diseases of the central nervous system (CNS) such as multiple sclerosis. How myelin deficiency might cause seizures is unknown, but may involve axonal pathology and resultant alterations in neuronal excitability. The cause of seizures occurring in rodent demyelination models is unknown. In the present study, we used EEG/video monitoring to record seizures occurring during chronic demyelination of C57BL/6 mice fed for 12 weeks with 0.2% cuprizone. Furthermore, in the search for a morphological correlate of the seizures, the hippocampal formation was examined histologically. Epileptiform spikes resembling interictal spikes known from chronic epilepsy were recorded in all cuprizone-treated mice, but not in controls. Most cuprizone-treated animals exhibited generalized tonic-clonic seizures upon stress-inducing stimuli. In addition to the known demyelination of the corpus callosum, massive demyelination was found in the hippocampal formation. This was associated with neuronal alterations, including a loss of neurons in the hilus of the dentate gyrus. In view of the role of the dentate gyrus in epileptogenesis, demyelination leading to axonal pathology and thus neuronal damage as observed in the hilus may be causally involved in the paroxysmal alterations observed after prolonged treatment with cuprizone. The present data suggest a potential role of the hippocampal formation for seizures occurring as a consequence of neuronal damage secondary to CNS demyelination. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

1193,2-s2.0-41149145928,Callosal contributions to simultaneous bimanual finger movements,"<p>Corpus callosum (CC) is involved in the performance of bimanual motor tasks. We asked whether its functional role could be investigated by combining a motor behavioral study on bimanual movements in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients with a quantitative magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) analysis of CC, which is shown to be damaged in this disease. MS patients and normal subjects were asked to perform sequences of bimanual finger opposition movements at different metronome rates; then we explored the structural integrity of CC by means of DTI. Significant differences in motor performance, mainly referred to timing accuracy, were observed between MS patients and control subjects. Bimanual motor coordination was impaired in MS patients as shown by the larger values of the interhand interval observed at all the tested metronome rates with respect to controls. Furthermore, DTI revealed a significant reduction of fractional anisotropy (FA), indicative of microstructural tissue damage, in the CC of MS patients. By correlating the mean FA values with the different motor behavior parameters, we found that the degree of damage in the anterior callosal portions mainly influences the bimanual coordination and, in particular, the movement phase preceding the finger touch. Finally, the described approach, which correlates quantitative measures of tissue damage obtained by advanced magnetic resonance imaging tools with appropriate behavioral measurements, may help the exploration of different aspects of motor performance impairment attributable to the disease.

Demyelinization plaques were examined according to their number, size and location in brain tissue. Classification was done by Frederiksen's quantification. The study included 18 (56.3%) female and 1.4 (43.7%) male patients aged 17-44, mean 32±2.4 years. The predominant plaque location was periventricular (100%), involving lateral brain chambers, followed by subcortical, pontine, corpus callosum, cerebellar and other locations (medulla oblongata, spinal marrow). According to plaque number, patients were divided into six groups, from 2-6 plaques (group 1), to 26 lesions (divided into four subgroups). Patients with at least one plaque 15 mm in diameter were allocated to a separate group. The largest was the group with 7-15 plaques (37%). According to plaque size, patients were divided into three groups: plaque of up to 6 mm in diameter, 6-15 mm in diameter, and at least one plaque 15 mm in diameter. Patients with plaque size 6-15 mm were found to predominate (64%). There was a surprisingly high incidence of severe brain damage, i. e. higher degrees by Frederiksen's quantification. The third and fourth quantification degrees were most common, with a significant number of plaques not exceeding 15 mm in diameter; however, there also were been patients with plaques of 15 mm in diameter, which is quite surprising at this early stage of the disease. This pilot study indicated that research should be extended to patients newly clinically diagnosed with MS, comparing their clinical symptoms and Frederiksen's quantification.</p>"

Method: A case report. Result: 26-year old Malay lady presented with gradual progression of left upper and lower limb numbness and weakness over six years, followed by urinary and bowel dysfunction and unsteady gait over the last two years. There was no history of trauma or infection and no history of similar illness in the past. On examination there was a deficit in convergence with diplopia and flickering eye movement but there was no signs of optic nuritis, she had ataxia and dysarthria. MRI with gadolinium was done which showed multiple plaques at the periventricular area, and at the brain stem and corpus callosum. Diagnosis was made as a progressive relapsing multiple sclerosis, patient was started on intravenous mitoxantrone 12mg / m<sup>2</sup> once every three months, and physiotherapy. Eight months later patient showed no more progression of the illness but showed amenorrhea as a side effect of mitoxantone.

In relapsing-remitting (RR) multiple sclerosis (MS), abnormalities in normal appearing brain tissue (NABT) have been shown cross-sectionally. The evolution of these abnormalities over time is unclear. We present a longitudinal study investigating early RR MS subjects. The aims were to determine DTI changes over two years and assess the potential of DTI as a longitudinal quantitative marker at this stage of MS. Fifteen controls and 28 patients with RR MS (median disease duration 1.9 years; median EDSS 1.5) had DTI yearly for two years. NABT and whole brain tissue (NABT plus lesions) FA and MD histograms analysed. At baseline, differences in FA were noted between patients and controls (mean [p = 0.042] and peak height [p = 0.008]), while at two years differences in MD were observed (mean [p = 0.008] and peak location [p = 0.024]). However there were no significant DTI differences in longitudinal rates of change between patients and cohorts. In conclusion, although subtle NABT abnormalities were detected in early RR MS, the absence of longitudinal change suggests a limited role for global DTI assessment of NABT in following the early disease course. © 2008 Steinkopff-Verlag.</p>"
1198,2-s2.0-40749143137,Application of fMRI to the study of multiple sclerosis: An update,"<p>During the past decade, functional MRI studies in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) have consistently shown that the variable effectiveness of recovery mechanisms following disease-related tissue injury is one of the factors that might explain, at least partially, the paucity of the correlation between clinical and MRI findings in these patients. More recently, technical developments resulted in an improvement of acquisition and post-processing schemes that, in turn, allowed us to further characterize the functional and structural abnormalities of specific regions of the CNS, thus ameliorating the understanding of the mechanisms associated with the clinical manifestations and disability accumulation in MS. This review focuses on such recent achievements and provides an update of functional MRI studies of MS performed in the past few years. © 2008 Future Medicine Ltd.</p>"
1199,2-s2.0-38749140982,The topographical distribution of tissue injury in benign MS: A 3T multiparametric MRI study,"<p>We compared the global and regional distribution of white matter (WM) and gray matter (GM) damage and T2-visible lesion between patients with benign (B) and relapsing remitting (RR) multiple sclerosis (MS). BMS and RRMS patients did not differ in terms of global volumes and diffusion tensor (DT) MRI metrics of the WM and GM. Compared to controls, BMS and RRMS patients had bilateral thalamic loss. Compared to controls, BMS and RRMS patients had lower WM fractional anisotropy (FA) in the corpus callosum (CC) and in several regions of temporal and occipital lobes. BMS also had a decreased WM FA in the parietal lobes. RRMS patients had also lower WM FA in several regions of the frontal lobes. Compared to BMS, RRMS patients had decreased WM FA in the frontal lobes, while the opposite comparison showed lower WM FA in the CC, the temporal lobes and the cuneus in BMS. Contrasted to controls, both MS groups showed several regions of increased MD in WM and GM, but no difference was found between MS sub-groups. T2-visible lesions were mainly located in the posterior regions of the brain in BMS patients, while they involved also regions in the frontal lobes, in RRMS patients. BMS and RRMS patients differ in terms of the topographical distribution of WM damage rather than in the overall extent of brain structural changes. The less prominent involvement of the frontal lobe WM and of the NAWM in general in BMS might be associated to their favorable clinical status. © 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.</p>"
1200,2-s2.0-38749130449,Whole brain voxel-wise analysis of single-subject serial DTI by permutation testing,"<p>Diffusion tensor MRI (DTI) has been widely used to investigate brain microstructural changes in pathological conditions as well as for normal development and aging. In particular, longitudinal changes are vital to the understanding of progression but these studies are typically designed for specific regions of interest. To analyze changes in these regions traditional statistical methods are often employed to elucidate group differences which are measured against the variability found in a control cohort. However, in some cases, rather than collecting multiple subjects into two groups, it is necessary and more informative to analyze the data for individual subjects. There is also a need for understanding changes in a single subject without prior information regarding the spatial distribution of the pathology, but no formal statistical framework exists for these voxel-wise analyses of DTI. In this study, we present PERVADE (permutation voxel-wise analysis of diffusion estimates), a whole brain analysis method for detecting localized FA changes between two separate points in time of any given subject, without any prior hypothesis about where changes might occur. Exploiting the nature of DTI that it is calculated from multiple diffusion-weighted images of each region, permutation testing, a non-parametric hypothesis testing technique, was modified for the analysis of serial DTI data and implemented for voxel-wise hypothesis tests of diffusion metric changes, as well as for suprathreshold cluster analysis to correct for multiple comparisons. We describe PERVADE in detail and present results from Monte Carlo simulation supporting the validity of the technique as well as illustrative examples from a healthy subject and patients in the early stages of multiple sclerosis. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

1201,2-s2.0-37849036858,Promoting remyelination in multiple sclerosis by endogenous adult neural stem/precursor cells: Defining cellular targets,"<p>Although the treatment of multiple sclerosis has made significant strides in the last decade, the therapeutic enhancement of repair has yet to make the successful translation from laboratory to clinic. Nevertheless, advances in the biology of stem and precursor cells, particularly in relation to myelin damage, make this a realistic proposition during the next decade. Replacing lost myelin (remyelination) is currently thought to be an important clinical objective because of the role it might play in slowing or preventing axonal degeneration. Stem/precursor cell-based strategies for enhancing remyelination can be divided into those in which cells are transplanted into a patient (exogenous or cell therapies) and those in which the patient's own stem/precursor cells are mobilised to more efficiently engage in healing areas of demyelination (endogenous or pharmacological therapies). While the two approaches tend to be regarded separately they are not mutually exclusive. This article focuses on the endogenous approach and reviews the nature and nomenclature of the stem and precursor cells present within the adult CNS that engage in remyelination and that are therefore potential targets for pharmacological manipulation. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

1203,2-s2.0-38149031549,Sequential myelin protein expression during remyelination reveals fast and efficient repair after central nervous system demyelination,"<p>To understand the mechanisms of remyelination and the reasons for regeneration failure is one of the major challenges in multiple sclerosis research. This requires a good knowledge and reliable analysis of experimental models. This work was undertaken to characterize the pattern of myelin protein expression during experimental remyelination. Acute demyelination of the corpus callosum was induced by feeding of 0.3% cuprizone for 6 weeks, followed by a 10-week remyelination period. We used a combination of Luxol fast blue (LFB) myelin staining, electron microscopy (EM) and immunohistochemistry for the myelin proteins 2′,3′-cyclic nucleotide 3′ phosphodiesterase (CNPase), myelin basic protein (MBP), proteolipid protein (PLP) and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG). Early remyelination was detected by the re-expression of CNPase, MBP and PLP as early as 4 days. MOG, as a marker for late differentiation of oligodendrocytes, was not detectable until 2 weeks of remyelination. EM data correlated well with the LFB myelin staining and myelin protein expression, with 50% of the axons being rapidly remyelinated within 2 weeks. While particularly MBP but also PLP and CNPase are re-expressed very early before significant remyelination is observed by EM, the late marker MOG shows a lag behind the remyelination detected by EM. The presented data indicate that immunohistochemistry for various myelin proteins expressed early and late during myelin formation is a suitable and reliable method to follow remyelination in the cuprizone model. Furthermore, investigation of early remyelination confirms that the intrinsic repair programme is very fast and switched on within days. © 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.</p>"
1204,2-s2.0-63249133008,MRI diagnosis of multiple cerebral sclerosis,"<p>OBJECTIVE:To investigate the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) feature of multiple cerebral sclerosis (MS) for better understanding and diagnosis of this disease. METHODS: The MRI data of 32 patients with MS were reviewed. Conventional scanning with T1WI, T2WI, Flair sequence was performed, and 26 patients underwent Gd-DTPA enhanced scanning. The MS plaques were analyzed for their locations, sizes, shapes, MR signals and enhanced features, space-occupying signs, and the related corpus callosum changes and brain atrophy. Descriptive statistical method was used for all the data. RESULTS: MRI identified MS lesions in the brain in 30 cases, with the sensitivity of 93.75%. All the MS patients had multiple lesions with predilection sites of the cortical/juxtacortical and periventricle areas, the centrum semiovale, and the corpus callosum. Most of the MS plaques were round or oval of different sizes. Bilateral lesions were almost symmetrical in distribution. Twenty patients had ""rectangular demyelination"" and 12 had ""dirty white matter"" signs, and 11 had both manifestations. The lesions were isointense, slightly hypointense or hypointense on T1WI, and hyperintense on T2WI and Flair sequences. Most of the MS plaques presented no enhancement, with occasional nodular or circular enhancement. No or slight space-occupying effect was found in the plaques. Of the 28 MS patients undergoing sagittal scanning of the corpus callosum, 17 presented with abnormal signals, with the sensitivity of 60.71% (17/28). Five patients had corpus callosum atrophy, and 10 had brain atrophy of different degrees.CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the corpus callosum is often compromised by the MS lesions to present diffusive, nodular, radiating signal abnormalities and irregular ependymal thickening, which can be most obvious with sagittal FLAIR imaging.</p>"
1205,2-s2.0-56149100106,Cerebral and spinal MRI examination in patients with clinically isolated syndrome and definite multiple sclerosis,"<p>Purpose: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has become a valuable tool for diagnosing and monitoring multiple sclerosis (MS). The high sensitivity for the detection of hyperintense lesions in T2-weighted scans contributes substantially to diagnosis. The initial lesion number or lesion volume stands for an increased probability of further accumulation of lesion burden, an earlier conversion to clinically definite MS and progression of disability in the next 5-15 years. This diagnostic and prognostic information gained from MRI early in the disease course lead in 2001 to a revision of the diagnostic criteria. Materials and Methods: For the first time MRI criteria were defined in addition to the clinical and paraclinical criteria using the clinical terms for dissemination with respect to space and time. In particular, the defined MRI criteria are based on lesion number and location, the appearance of new lesions and lesion enhancement using contrast agent. Results: Reliable detection and description of older and new lesions in the disease course by MRI represents subclinical disease activity which can substitute the clinical confirmation of a relapse leading to an earlier diagnosis. This places importance on the assessment of the subclinical disease activity in sequential MR scans requiring a standardized and reproducible approach to minimize variability despite different MR scanners. Conclusion: This review provides an updated proposal for the approach and management of cranial and spinal MR scans in patients with MS. We describe the influence of variables which cannot be standardized (scanner, field strength, manufacturer and software) and outline potential pitfalls of clinical MR imaging in MS resulting from a non-standardized approach. This updated proposal for slice positioning, sequences and documentation is a result of a consensus process targeting systematic and standardized use in clinical MR evaluations of MS. © Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart.</p>"
1206,2-s2.0-52949148171,Diffusion tensor MR imaging evaluation of the corpus callosum of patients with multiple sclerosis,"<p>Objective: To evaluate the fractional anisotropy (FA) values of the normal-appearing white matter of the corpus callosum (CC) in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (MS). Method: Fifty-seven patients with diagnosis of relapsing-remitting MS and 47 age- and gender-matched controls were studied. A conventional MR imaging protocol and a DTI sequence were performed. One neuroradiologist placed the regions of interest (ROIs) in the FA maps in five different portions of the normal-apearing CC (rostrum, genu, anterior and posterior portion of the body and splenium) in all cases. The statistical analysis was performed with the Mann-Whitney U test and p&lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: The FA values were lower in the MS patients compared with the controls (p&lt;0.05) in the following CC regions: rostrum (0.720 vs 0.819), anterior body (0.698 vs 0.752), posterior body (0.711 vs 0.759) and splenium (0.720 vs 0.880). Conclusion: In this series, there was a robust decrease in the FA in all regions of the normal-appearing CC, being significant in the rostrum, body and splenium. This finding suggests that there is a subtle and diffuse abnormality in the CC, which could be probably related to myelin content loss, axonal damage and gliosis.</p>"
1207,2-s2.0-51349164037,Brain atrophy as a marker of cognitive impairment in mildly disabling relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis,"<p>Background and purpose: We have studied the relationship between neuropsychological impairment and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures in mildly disabling relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). Methods: We compared measures of lesion burden and atrophy in 52 patients with Expanded Disability Status Scale ≤ 3.0. Neuropsychological testing explored various cognitive domains: attention and processing speed (APS), verbal and visual memory (VerbM; VisM), visual/constructional processes (VC), executive functions and motor programming/coordination. Specific and global index scores were derived to classify patients as deteriorated or not deteriorated by comparing their performance with 51 matched normal control subjects. Brain MRI analysis included proton density (PD)-lesion volume and T1-hypointensity volume, measures of central atrophy, including the third ventricle width, and corpus callosum (CC). Results: Patients with either APS, MCP or Verbal Learning impairments had a higher ventricular atrophy than unimpaired. The atrophy of the CC was only associated to VisM dysfunction. Patients with VisM deficits had higher lesion load on PD images. After controlling for age and education a higher third ventricle width was the best predictor for global and specific cognitive impairment. Conclusion: Our results suggest that cognitive impairment in RR patients with mild disease is better explained by atrophic changes than by total lesion load. © 2008 The Author(s).</p>"
1208,2-s2.0-48049083992,A case of suspected multiple sclerosis with transcallosal lesions involving the upper surface of the corpus callosum,"<p>A 26-year-old woman noticed gradually progressive, right lower leg weakness over a 1.5-month period. Neurological examination revealed right hemiparesis with slightly increased deep tendon reflexes, Babinski's sign on the right side, loss of position sense in the right leg, and slight loss of superficial sensation in the right toes. MR FLAIR images showed a high intensity area measuring 5 x 2 x 3 cm in the left frontal lobe, extending to the outer surface of the body of the corpus callosum and the adjacent right cingulate gyrus. Gadolinium enhancement was seen along the cortex and the outer surface of the body of the corpus callosum. CSF findings showed no pleocytosis, a protein content of 32 mg/dl, a sugar level of 85 mg/dl, and an IgG index of 0.46. The biopsy specimen obtained from the superior frontal gyrus showed perivascular cuffing of T-lymphocytes and some B-lymphocytes, as well as multiple small foci of demyelination. Starting on the second day of admission, the patient was treated with methylprednisolone pulse therapy (1,000 mg/day for 3 days); she was then switched to oral prednisolone (20 mg/day). Thereafter, the patient had two clinical relapses: one was due to a lesion in the dorsal part of the medulla oblongata associated with a disturbance of deep sensation in both hands, and the other was due to a lesion involving the right internal capsule, the globus pallidus, and the caudate nucleus associated with left facial nerve palsy. Visual evoked potentials suggested a demyelinating lesion in the right optic nerve. We suspected a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis based on the presence of more than two clinical episodes of neurological deficits with identifiable lesions on MRI. Multiple sclerosis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of lesions located in the outer part of the corpus callosum and transcallosal bilateral hemispheres on MRI, even though inner callosal lesions are common in multiple sclerosis.</p>"
1209,2-s2.0-46149106573,Early anisotropy changes in the corpus callosum of patients with optic neuritis,"<p>Introduction: Optic neuritis (ON) and any other early manifestation of multiple sclerosis (MS) are referred to as clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) as long as MS is suspected. In this prospective study we aimed to determine whether diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) could quantify structural changes in patients with early MS. Methods: A total of 24 patients and 15 control subjects were prospectively followed by clinical examinations and MRI. the main inclusion criterion was presentation with ON. Patients underwent serial MRI scans: MRI1 (baseline, n=24), MRI2 (mean 6.6 months, n=24), MRI3 (mean 13.0 months, n=14), MRI4 (mean 39.4 months, n=5). Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and fractional anisotropy (FA) maps were derived from DTI. Four regions of interest (ROIs) were defined in normal-appearing white matter (NAWM). Results: In the temporal course FA decreased in the genu of the callosal body (GCC) from MRI1 to MRI4 (P=0.005) and in the splenium of the callosal body (SCC) (P=0.006). Patients already had lower FA values in the SCC (P&lt;0.01) on MRI1 compared with the controls. Patients had lower FA values in the GCC (P&lt;0.01) starting from MRI2. Patients with definite MS on follow-up (n=9) showed a correlation between FA in the SCC and time (r=-0.40, P=0.004), whereas patients without progression did not. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that the corpus callosum is an early site for development of anisotropy changes in MS patients with ON. There seems to be a primary FA decrease in all patients with ON that only deteriorates in the group developing definite MS. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.</p>"
1210,2-s2.0-44149103646,Diffusion weighted callosal integrity reflects interhemispheric communication efficiency in multiple sclerosis,"<p>We aimed to investigate the relation between damage in the corpus callosum and the performance on an interhemispheric communication task in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). Relative callosal lesion load defined as the ratio between callosal area and the total lesion load in the total corpus callosum, and the diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) derived measures fractional anisotropy (FA) and transverse and longitudinal diffusivity were calculated in sixteen female MS patients and sixteen age and education matched female controls. The redundancy gain task was used to behaviorally evaluate interhemispheric communication efficiency. During this task, simple reaction times to uni- and bilateral presented stimuli are recorded. The advantage in reaction time for bilateral as compared to unilateral trials, the redundancy gain, was significantly larger for the MS-group. The DTI data showed significantly decreased FA and increased diffusivity parameters in the corpus callosum for the MS patients compared with the control group. Moreover, we found a significant correlation between the DTI-derived measures in the corpus callosum and the redundancy gain effect. Callosal damage in MS, as measured by DTI and defined as transverse diffusivity, is associated with alterations in a behavioral task that relies on interhemispheric transfer and communication. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

1211,2-s2.0-42049109071,Cortical demyelination is prominent in the murine cuprizone model and is strain-dependent,"<p>The cuprizone model of toxic demyelination in the central nervous system is commonly used to investigate the pathobiology of remyelination in the corpus callosum. However, in human demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis, recent evidence indicates a considerable amount of cortical demyelination in addition to white matter damage. Therefore, we have investigated cortical demyelination in the murine cuprizone model. To induce demyelination, C57BL/6 mice were challenged with 0.2% cuprizone feeding for 6 weeks followed by a recovery phase of 6 weeks with a cuprizone-free diet. In addition to the expected demyelination in the corpus callosum, the cortex of C57BL/6 mice was completely demyelinated after 6 weeks of cuprizone feeding. After withdrawal of cuprizone the cortex showed complete remyelination similar to that in the corpus callosum. When C57BL/6 mice were fed cuprizone for a prolonged period of 12 weeks, cortical remyelination was significantly delayed. Because interstrain differences have been described, we also investigated the effects of cuprizone on cortical demyelination in BALB/cJ mice. In these mice, cortical demyelination was only partial. Moreover, cortical microglia accumulation was markedly increased in BALB/cJ mice, whereas microglia were absent in the cortex of C57BL/6 mice. In summary, our results show that cuprizone feeding is an excellent model in which to study cortical demyelination and remyelination, including contributing genetic factors represented by strain differences.

1213,2-s2.0-41149116636,Use of combined conventional and quantitative MRI to quantify pathology related to cognitive impairment in multiple sclerosis,"<p>Background: Cognitive impairment is one of the frequent and early findings in multiple sclerosis (MS). Objective: To determine the relation between cognitive abnormalities and the extent of macroscopic and microscopic tissue damage in the corpus callosum (CC), revealed by conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), magnetisation transfer imaging (MTI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Methods: Conventional dual-echo, DTI and MTI of the brain were obtained from 36 patients with relapsing remitting (RR) MS, and 13 age and gender matched normal controls. Voxels from CC were identified using a tractography based algorithm. Mean apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC<sub>av</sub>) and MT ratio were measured for the CC as defined by tractography. Corpus callosum area (CCA) was measured using edge detection on the midsagittal slice on high resolution MRI images. The Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) and Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT) were scored. Results: Nine patients (25%) were found to be cognitively impaired. The CCA was not significantly different in the whole cohort of patients from controls (608.2 (428.6-713.0) mm<sup>2</sup> vs 674.2 (585.8-754.4) mm<sup>2</sup>, p = 0.1), but was smaller in cognitively impaired than unimpaired group (417 (290-634) mm<sup>2</sup> vs 652 (511-718) mm<sup>2</sup>, p = 0.04). The mean MT ratio of CC in patients was lower than in controls (0.41 (0.39-0.042) vs 0.43 (0.42-0.43), p&lt;0.001). The ADC <sub>av</sub> in the CC in patients was higher than in controls (0.94 (0.89-0.99) vs 0.87 (0.85-0.89), p&lt;0.001). PASAT was correlated with mean MT ratio (r = 0.47, p = 0.0046), ADC<sub>av</sub> (r = -0.53, p = 0.0012), CCA (r = 0.42, p = 0.01) and total T<sub>2</sub> lesion load (r = -0.4, p = 0.017), but not with T<sub>2</sub> lesion load within the CC (r = -0.24, p = 0.16), disease duration (r = -0.2, p = 0.24) or EDSS (r = -0.27, p = 0.12).

1214,2-s2.0-40449131523,MRI identification of the rostral-caudal pattern of pathology within the corpus callosum in the cuprizone mouse model,"<p>Purpose: To characterize and compare histological and MRI-based changes within the corpus callosum (CC) in the cuprizone mouse model of multiple sclerosis (MS). Materials and Methods: A total of 12 C57/BL6 mice were fed cuprizone from eight weeks of age for four weeks. One cohort of six cuprizone and two control mice were scanned with a T2-weighted (T2W) sequence. The other cohort of six cuprizone and four control mice were scanned using a dual-echo sequence for T2-mapping and a diffusion-weighted sequence with two orthogonal diffusion encoding directions to calculate water diffusivities parallel and perpendicular to the CC fiber (apparent diffusion coefficients [ADC] <sub>∥</sub> and ADC<sub>⊥</sub>). After the mice were killed, the rostral-caudal pattern of CC demyelination and other pathologies were examined using Luxol Fast Blue, neurofilament staining, and immunohistochemistry for microglia and were correlated with MRI. Results: In contrast to control mice, T2W imaging (T2WI) hyperintensity, reduced ADC<sub>∥</sub>, and elevated ADC<sub>⊥</sub> were detected in the CC of cuprizone-fed mice, particularly in the caudal segment. The T2 value was increased in the entire CC, Marked demyelination, as well as axonal injury, microglia accumulation, and cellular infiltration were found in the caudal section of the cuprizone mouse CC. The rostral-caudal pattern of abnormalities within the CC in MRI measurements correlated well with histopathological findings. Conclusion: Noninvasive MRI using quantitative T2 and ADC mapping accurately characterized the rostral-caudal pattern of CC demyelination and other pathologies in cuprizone challenged mice, and thus could provide an effective way to assess the structural response to experimental therapeutics being designed for the treatment of MS. © 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.</p>"
1215,2-s2.0-39849083749,TNF superfamily member TWEAK exacerbates inflammation and demyelination in the cuprizone-induced model,"<p>Inflammatory cytokines have been implicated in the pathology of multiple neurologic diseases, including multiple sclerosis. We examined the role of the TNF family member TWEAK in neuroinflammation. Cuprizone-fed mice undergo neuroinflammation and demyelination in the brain, but upon removal of cuprizone from the diet, inflammation is resolved and remyelination occurs. Using this model, we demonstrate that mice lacking TWEAK exhibit a significant delay in demyelination and microglial infiltration. During remyelination, mice lacking the TWEAK gene demonstrate only a marginal delay in remyelination. Thus, this study identifies a primary role of TWEAK in promoting neuroinflammation and exacerbating demyelination during cuprizone-induced damage. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.</p>"
1216,2-s2.0-38749099406,Treatment of Susac's syndrome,"<p>Susac's syndrome (SS) Consists of the triad of encephalopathy, branch retinal artery occlusions (BRAO), and hearing loss. It usually affects women aged 20 to 40, but men are also affected, and the age range extends from 9 to 72 years. It tends to be unrecognized, even in major academic centers. The complete triad may not be present at the onset, which makes diagnosis more difficult. However, since this disorder is treatable, early diagnosis is important. The encephalopathy is usually associated with headaches, multifocal neurologic manifestations, and psychiatric features (particularly paranoia). MRI shows a white matter disturbance that is frequently confused with multiple sclerosis and acute disseminated encephalomyelitis. During the encephalopathy, the corpus callosum is always affected and shows central involvement - small to large ""snow-balls"" and linear defects, ""spokes"". As the acute changes (microinfarcts) resolve, central callosal ""holes"" develop, a pathognomonic finding. The deep gray matter (70%) and leptomeninges (33%) also may be involved. Dilated fundus examination will reveal branch retinal artery occlusions. Fluorescein angiography may disclose pathognomonic staining of the arterioles proximal to the occlusions and of nonoccluded arterioles. The cochlear hearing loss, sometimes associated with vertigo, is usually bilateral, and deafness becomes a major disabling problem. Brain biopsies, anatomic observations, and responses to immunosuppressive therapy suggest that SS represents an autoimmune endotheliopathy in the microvasculature of the brain, retina, and cochlea. Treatment requires immunosuppression. High-dose corticosteroid therapy is the mainstay, but additional therapies such as intravenous immunoglobulin, mycophenolate mofetil, and cyclophosphamide are often necessary. Rituximab is the newest therapy to consider. Treatment should be prompt, aggressive, and sustained to avoid the dreaded residuals of dementia, deafness, and blindness.

1217,2-s2.0-57649231149,"Longitudinal, regional and deformation-specific corpus callosum shape analysis for multiple sclerosis","<p>The corpus callosum (CC) is an anatomical structure which connects the two brain hemispheres. Neurological diseases can cause atrophy of the CC resulting in a change in its size and shape. The measurement and analysis of this change is one of the goals of clinical research. We perform statistical analysis of the shape of the CC extracted from MR brain scans of a group of multiple sclerosis patients undergoing a longitudinal (serial) study. In contrast to the classical boundary-based, global shape variability measures, e.g. principal component analysis (PCA) of CC boundary vertices, we perform a deformation-specific PCA for analyzing the global and regional shape of the CC. This deformationspecific PCA is based on a medial-based shape representation. The adopted shape representation describes shape variability in terms of intuitive deformations (e.g. bending, stretching and thickness). We present qualitative and quantitative results for 412 MR images of the CC. We show that our method is successful in identifying and quantifying the effect of each type of deformation on the shape variability of the CC. In addition to analyzing the spatial shape variability in the CC, we explore shape changes as the disease progresses. Our method allows the exploration of the shape variability quantitatively (e.g. the amount of variance explained by a particular principal mode of shape variation) as well as in a qualitative visual manner (e.g. by visualizing, say, the 2 <sup>nd</sup> principal mode of shape variation due to bending at the 4 <sup>th</sup> sub-region of the CC) which is useful for developing an intuitive understanding of the effects of MS on the CC shape. © 2007 IEEE.</p>"
1218,2-s2.0-35848944446,Platelet-derived growth factor promotes repair of chronically demyelinated white matter,"<p>In multiple sclerosis, remyelination becomes limited after repeated or prolonged episodes of demyelination. To test the effect of platelet-derived growth factor-A (PDGF-A) in recovery from chronic demyelination we induced corpus callosum demyelination using cuprizone treatment in hPDGF-A transgenic (tg) mice with the human PDGF-A gene under control of an astrocyte-specific promoter. After chronic demyelination and removal of cuprizone from the diet, remyelination and oligodendrocyte density improved significantly in hPDGF-A tg mice compared with wild-type mice. In hPDGF-A tg mice, oligodendrocyte progenitor density and proliferation values were increased in the corpus callosum during acute demyelination but not during chronic demyelination or the subsequent recovery period, compared with hPDGF-A tg mice without cuprizone or to treatment-matched wild-type mice. Proliferation within the subventricular zone and subcallosal zone was elevated throughout cuprizone treatment but was not different between hPDGF-A tg and wild-type mice. Importantly, hPDGF-A tg mice had reduced apoptosis in the corpus callosum during the recovery period after chronic demyelination. Therefore, PDGF-A may support oligodendrocyte generation and survival to promote remyelination of chronic lesions. Furthermore, preventing oligodendrocyte apoptosis may be important not only during active demyelination but also for supporting the generation of new oligodendrocytes to remyelinate chronic lesions. © 2007 American Association of Neuropathologists, Inc.</p>"
1219,2-s2.0-35649010838,Persistent activation of microglia is associated with neuronal dysfunction of callosal projecting pathways and multiple sclerosis-like lesions in relapsing-remitting experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis,"<p>Cortical pathology, callosal atrophy and axonal loss are substrates of progression in multiple sclerosis (MS). Here we describe cortical, periventricular subcortical lesions and callosal demyelination in relapsing-remitting experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in SJL mice that are similar to lesions found in MS. Unlike the T-cell infiltrates that peak during acute disease, we found that microglia activation persists through the chronic disease phase. Microglia activation correlated with abnormal phosphorylation of neurofilaments in the cortex and stripping of synaptic proteins in cortical callosal projecting neurons. There was significant impairment of retrograde labeling of NeuN-positive callosal projecting neurons and reduction in the labelling of their transcallosal axons. These data demonstrate a novel paradigm of cortical and callosal neuropathology in a mouse model of MS, perpetuated by innate immunity. These features closely mimic the periventricular and cortical pathology described in MS patients and establish a model that could be useful to study mechanisms of progression in MS. © The Author (2007).

1221,2-s2.0-36448943620,Transient focal lesion in the splenium of the corpus callosum: MR imaging with an attempt to clinical-physiopathological explanation and review of the literature,"<p>Purpose. This article discusses the possible pathophysiological conditions responsible for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) finding of transient focal lesions in the splenium of the corpus callosum on the basis of our experience and a review of the literature. Materials and methods. In six patients undergoing computed tomography (CT) and MRI examinations, focal nonhemorrhagic lesions of the splenium of the corpus callosum were incidentally discovered. Patients had been referred for suspected encephalitis (n=2), dural sinus thrombosis (n=1) and multiple sclerosis (n=3). MRI examinations were repeated after 4, 8 and 12 weeks and in two cases also after 6 and 9 months. MRI and medical records were retrospectively reviewed with respect to patients' clinical history, medication and laboratory findings to define lesion aetiology. Results. In all patients, the lesions were isolated, reversible and with no contrast enhancement. In four patients, the lesion disappeared after complete remission of the underlying disease, whereas in two patients, they persisted for 6 and 9 months, respectively. Conclusions. To our knowledge and according to previous reports, the fact that these lesions are detected in a relatively large number of conditions with heterogeneous etiopathogenetic factors leads to the hypothesis that a common underlying pathophysiological mechanism that, considering signal characteristic, reversibility and white matter location, could be represented by vasogenic oedema. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.</p>"
1222,2-s2.0-36148942097,Spinal cord lesions of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy in an acquired immunodeficiency syndrome patient,"<p>Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) is a deadly demyelinating disease of the central nervous system, which occurs in immunosuppressed individuals. This disease is caused by a reactivation of the polyomavirus JC (JCV). Clinical presentation can be variable from patient to patient as lesions can occur anywhere in the CNS white matter; however, they appear to spare the optic nerves and the spinal cord. The authors present a case of PML in the setting of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) who developed PML lesions in the spinal cord, discovered during the postmortem examination. This finding is significant because PML has recently been diagnosed in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) treated with the novel immunomodulatory medication natalizumab. Indeed, spinal cord lesions are frequent in MS. Therefore clinicians should be aware that in addition to the brain, PML may also affect the spinal cord white matter.</p>"

The human endogenous retrovirus (HERV-W) envelope protein, Syncytin-1, is highly expressed in CNS glia of individuals with multiple sclerosis (MS). In this study, we investigated the mechanisms by which Syncytin-1 mediated neuroimmune activation and oligodendrocytes damage. In brain tissue from individuals with MS, ASCT1, a receptor for Syncytin-1 and a neutral amino acid transporter, was selectively suppressed in astrocytes (p &lt; 0.05). Syncytin-1 induced the expression of the endoplasmic reticulum stress sensor, old astrocyte specifically induced substance (OASIS), in cultured astrocytes, similar to findings in MS brains. Overexpression of OASIS in astrocytes increased inducible NO synthase expression but concurrently down-regulated ASCT1 (p&lt;0.01). Treatment of astrocytes with a NO donor enhanced expression of early growth response 1, with an ensuing reduction in ASCT1 expression (p &lt; 0.05). Small-interfering RNA molecules targeting Syncytin-1 selectively down-regulated its expression, preventing the suppression of ASCT1 and the release of oligodendrocyte cytotoxins by astrocytes. A Syncytin-1-transgenic mouse expressing Syncytin-1 under the glial fibrillary acidic protein promoter demonstrated neuroinflammation, ASCT1 suppression, and diminished levels of myelin proteins in the corpus callosum, consistent with observations in CNS tissues from MS patients together with neurobehavioral abnormalities compared with wild-type littermates (p &lt; 0.05). Thus, Syncytin-1 initiated an OASIS-mediated suppression of ASCT1 in astrocytes through the induction of inducible NO synthase with ensuing oligodendrocyte injury. These studies provide new insights into the role of HERV-mediated neuroinflammation and its contribution to an autoimmune disease.

1224,2-s2.0-34447532399,Magnetization transfer ratio measurement in multiple sclerosis normal-appearing brain tissue: Limited differences with controls but relationships with clinical and MR measures of disease,"<p>We investigated the magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) of normal-appearing white (NAWM) and grey matter (NAGM) in a relatively large group of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients, and the relations of MTR changes with clinical disability. MTR was measured in 66 MS patients (12 PP, 35 RR, 19 SP) and 23 healthy controls, using a whole-brain 3D-FLASH technique corrected post-hoc for B<sub>1</sub>-induced variation. Histogram parameters of conservatively selected NAWM and cortical NAGM were analysed using Bonferroni-corrected ANOVA with age as covariate. Additionally, manually outlined regions of interest were analysed using a multilevel method. Lesions had low MTR (mean 22.7 ± 6.9%), but NAWM exhibited limited changes: MTR histogram peak position was 32.8 ± 1.0% in controls and 32.4 ± 0.9% in MS patients, with a significant decrease compared to controls only in SPMS patients (31.9 ± 1.1%, p=0.045). Cortical NAGM histograms did not differ significantly between patients and controls. In SPMS, regional mean MTR was significantly decreased in corpus callosum and hippocampus. MTR histogram parameters of NAGM and NAWM were correlated with EDSS and MSFC scores, with lesion volume and with normalized brain volume. We conclude that disease-induced MTR changes were small in MS NAWM and NAGM, but did correlate with clinical decline, lesion volume and overall cerebral atrophy. © 2007 Sage Publications.</p>"
1225,2-s2.0-34447333656,Effect of corpus callosum damage on ipsilateral motor activation in patients with multiple sclerosis: A functional and anatomical study,"<p>Functional MRI (fMRI) studies have shown increased activation of ipsilateral motor areas during hand movement in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). We hypothesized that these changes could be due to disruption of transcallosal inhibitory pathways. We studied 18 patients with relapsing-remitting MS. Conventional T1- and T2-weighted images were acquired and lesion load (LL) measured. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) was performed to estimate fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) in the body of the corpus callosum (CC). fMRI was obtained during a right-hand motor task. Patients were studied to evaluate transcallosal inhibition (TCI, latency and duration) and central conduction time (CCT). Eighteen normal subjects were studied with the same techniques. Patients showed increased MD (P &lt; 0.0005) and reduced FA (P &lt; 0.0005) in the body of the CC. Mean latency and duration of TCI were altered in 12 patients and absent in the others. Between-group analysis showed greater activation in patients in bilateral premotor, primary motor (M1), and middle cingulate cortices and in the ipsilateral supplementary motor area, insula, and thalamus. A multivariate analysis between activation patterns, structural MRI, and neurophysiological findings demonstrated positive correlations between T1-LL, MD in the body of CC, and activation of the ipsilateral motor cortex (iM1) in patients. Duration of TCI was negatively correlated with activation in the iM1. Our data suggest that functional changes in iM1 in patients with MS during a motor task partially represents a consequence of loss of transcallosal inhibitory fibers. © 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.</p>"

Materials and Methods: Participants provided informed consent; the study was approved by the institutional review board. Forty-six consecutive patients with RRMS (18 men, 28 women; mean age, 37.7 years; range, 18-58 years) and 26 consecutive patients with RNMO (two men, 24 women; mean age, 38.6 years; range, 19-59 years) underwent diffusion-tensor magnetic resonance imaging. Mean diffusivity (MD) and fractional anisotropy (FA) of the region of interest (ROI) of the CC in the midsagittal plane were measured and used as discriminative indexes. Bayesian classification with leave-one-out cross-validation was used to determine diagnostic accuracy. Differences in diffusion indexes of ROIs among groups were evaluated by using the Kruskal-Wallis test, followed by the Mann-Whitney U test for multiple comparisons and Bonferroni correction. Results: Mean MD (8.48 × 10<sup>-4</sup> mm<sup>2</sup>/sec) and FA (0.729) of the ROI in patients with RNMO were significantly (P &lt; .001) different from those (MD = 10.64 × 10<sup>-4</sup> mm<sup>2</sup>/sec, FA = 0.599) in patients with RRMS. Sensitivity and specificity for differentiation were 92.3% (24 of 26 patients with RNMO) and 93.5% (43 of 46 patients with RRMS) for FA and 88.5% (23 of 26 patients with RNMO) and 89.1% (41 of 46 patients with RRMS) for MD, respectively. Conclusion: Measurement of diffusion indexes of the CC may be useful for distinguishing patients with RNMO from those with RRMS. © RSNA, 2007.</p>"
1227,2-s2.0-34250658898,Susac syndrome in a young child,"<p>Susac syndrome is a microangiopathy of unknown origin affecting the brain, retina and inner ear. This rare entity is often misdiagnosed as a demyelinating condition such as multiple sclerosis or acute disseminated encephalomyelitis. A high index of suspicion must be present as the majority of patients do not have the complete clinical triad at the time of onset of symptoms. The radiologist plays an important role when the disease is suspected and helps orient the investigations. The syndrome has characteristic imaging features on MRI that include multifocal white matter and occasional grey matter lesions, the corpus callosum being always involved. The predominant central callosal lesions, especially with rapid cystic transformation (central callosal holes) can be considered pathognomonic of this condition in the appropriate clinical setting. This disease is extremely rare in children. We report a case of Susac syndrome in a 9-year-old girl to increase the awareness among paediatric radiologists of this entity, which is usually not considered as a differential diagnosis of multifocal white matter involvement in this age group. © Springer-Verlag 2007.</p>"
1228,2-s2.0-34247197112,Discordant white matter N-acetylasparate and diffusion MRI measures suggest that chronic metabolic dysfunction contributes to axonal pathology in multiple sclerosis,"<p>Diffusion MRI and magnetic resonance spectroscopic measurements of selectively neuronally localised N-acetylaspartate (NAA) both have been used widely to assess white matter integrity and axonal loss. We have tested directly the relationship between changes in diffusion MRI parameters and NAA concentrations in the corpus callosum (CC) in an in vivo study of patients with MS. Fifteen MS patients (median EDSS 2.5, range 1-4) were studied with T<sub>1</sub> anatomical, T<sub>2</sub>-weighted, and diffusion-sensitised MRI and PRESS single-voxel MRS. A recently described method, tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) [Smith, S.M., Jenkinson, M., Johansen-Berg, H., Rueckert, D., Nichols, T.E., Mackay, C.E. et al., 2006. Tract-based spatial statistics: voxelwise analysis of multi-subject diffusion data. Neuroimage 31, 1487-1505] also was used to perform exploratory voxelwise whole-brain analysis of white matter diffusion fractional anisotropy (FA). We found a strong correlation between callosal size and both mean FA (r = 0.68, p &lt; 0.005) (related specifically to changes in the radial tensor component) and mean inter-hemispheric motor tract connectivity probability (r = 0.74, p &lt; 0.001). TBSS confirmed that the diffusion anisotropies of white matter voxels specifically within the callosum were correlated with the callosal size. Individual patient global T<sub>2</sub> lesion volumes were correlated with both the probability of callosal connectivity (r = - 0.69, p &lt; 0.005) and fractional anisotropy across the callosum (r = - 0.76, p &lt; 0.001). However, absolute concentrations of NAA from the voxel showed no correlation with callosal cross-sectional area, mean connectivity or fractional anisotropy within the callosal pathway. We conclude that diffusion MRI shows changes consistent with sensitivity to axonal loss, but that relative NAA changes are not necessarily related directly to this. Axonal metabolic function, independent of structural integrity, may be a major determinant of NAA measures in MS. © 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.</p>"

She was right-handed person and her alien hand was such a manner; when she intended to use spoon with right hand, her left hand aimlessly began to hold and release a cup or dish. Then, she was diagnosed as diagnostic dyspraxia. Neuropsychological examinations disclosed left hemispheric dysfunction including left hand agraphia and disconnection of the callosum. MRI showed patchy lesions in the callosum, right optic radiation, both side thalamus (left &gt; right), left cerebral peduncle, and spinal cord of cervical to the thoracal portion. Although the functional disorders and the radiological atrophy of the callosum, the clinical manifestation of the callosal disconnection in MS cases has been scarcely reported, and this case seems to be a quite rare condition to be described.</p>"
1230,2-s2.0-33947721611,In vivo fiber tracking in the rat brain on a clinical 3T MRI system using a high strength insert gradient coil,"<p>In vivo neuroimaging methods permit longitudinal quantitative examination of the dynamic course of neurodegenerative conditions in humans and animal models and enable assessment of therapeutic efforts in mitigating disease effects on brain systems. The study of conditions affecting white matter, such as multiple sclerosis, demyelinating conditions, and drug and alcohol dependence, can be accomplished with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), a technique uniquely capable of probing the microstructural integrity of white matter fibers in the living brain. We used a 3T clinical MR scanner equipped with an insert gradient coil that yields an order of magnitude increase in performance over the whole-body hardware to acquire in vivo DTI images of rat brain. The resolution allowed for fiber tracking evaluation of fractional anisotropy (FA) and apparent diffusion coefficients in the genu and splenium of the corpus callosum. A comparison of short (46 min) and long (92 min) acquisition time DTI protocols indicated low but adequate signal-to-noise ratio (SNR = 6.2) of the shorter protocol to conduct quantitative fiber tracking enhanced by multiple acquisitions. As observed in human studies, FA in the rat splenium was higher than in the genu. Advantages of this technology include the use of similar user interface, pulse sequences, and field strength for preclinical animal and clinical human research, enhancing translational capabilities. An additional benefit of scanning at lower field strength, such as 3 T, is the reduction of artifacts due to main field inhomogeneity relative to higher field animal systems. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

1231,2-s2.0-34247094665,Neurotransmitter receptors in the life and death of oligodendrocytes,"<p>Oligodendrocytes are crucial to the function of the mammalian brain: they increase the action potential conduction speed for a given axon diameter and thus facilitate the rapid flow of information between different brain areas. The proliferation and differentiation of developing oligodendrocytes, and their myelination of axons, are partly controlled by neurotransmitters. In addition, in models of conditions like stroke, periventricular leukomalacia leading to cerebral palsy, spinal cord injury and multiple sclerosis, oligodendrocytes are damaged by glutamate and, contrary to dogma, it has recently been discovered that this damage is mediated in part by N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors. Mutations in oligodendrocyte neurotransmitter receptors or their interacting proteins may cause defects in CNS function. Here we review the roles of neurotransmitter receptors in the normal function, and malfunction in pathological conditions, of oligodendrocytes. © 2006 IBRO.</p>"
1232,2-s2.0-34547952422,The architecture and hierarchical pathways in the subthalamic nucleus using isotropic imaging,"<p>Objective: the subthalamic nucleus (STN) has gained importance as a focus for histological, anatomical and imaging research due to its implications in modulation basal ganglia output and Parkinson's disease. Little is known about the intrinsic organization of the STN. More information is needed to understand its role in the central nervous system (CNS) and allow more accurate planning in Functional Neurosurgery. We describe a method capable of delineating the boundaries of gray matter that could be used to study the internal architecture of the STN. Methods: eighty-seven patients were randomly selected from a magnetic resonance (MR) diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data bank. From these cases, we selected forty-four in which DTI showed the STN, but not the substantia nigra (SN) in the same image. After initial scrutiny, we excluded fourteen patients with tumors in the brain stem, mass effect, hydrocephalus or obvious malformations. We developed an algorithm by selecting the region of Interest in the STN as identified by the Isotropic Image instead of the Anisotropic one. Results: after reviewing these 30 studies, we identified regions of track concurrency (RTC). In all cases reviewed, RTC showed a hierarchical position from medial to lateral according to the longitudinal axis of the STN and the origin of the fibers. This arrangement revealed a more medial position of the fibers with connection to the parietal, frontal posterior and frontal polar cortex (Brodmann's areas 7, 4 and 11), a central position for the fibers interacting with the corpus callosum and a lateral position of the fibers interacting with the frontal-medial cortex. Conclusion: the technique described allows fiber tracking in the gray matter, undetectable by other imaging methods. It has helped detail the description of STN architecture, evidencing a constant hierarchical position regarding its interconnections. This information helps elucidate the architectural complexity of this nucleus and may prove of use during implantation and programming procedures employed in Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS). ©INNN, 2007.</p>"

Methods: MR diffusion tensor imaging was performed in thirty-two patients with internal carotid artery stenosis ≥70% and eighteen patients with clinical diagnosed multiple sclerosis. Fractional anisotropy (FA) value of the genu, splenium, body of the corpus callosum, and the white matter of the frontal and occipital lobe were measured respectively, and independent-sample t-test statistical analysis was performed. Results: The FA value was decreased obviously in the anterior and posterior body and splenium of the corpus callosumin the MS patients compared with the ICA severe stenosis patients (0.67 ± 0.12 vs. 0.75 ± 0.05, t = 3.443, P &lt; 0.01; 0.67 ± 0.09 vs. 0.72 ± 0.05, t = 2.281, P &lt; 0.01; 0.71 ± 0.01 vs. 0.76 ± 0.06, t = 1.846, P &lt; 0.01), but had no significant difference at the genu, the white matter of the frontal and occipital lobe of the two groups(0.63 ± 0.13 vs. 0.69 ± 0.08, t = 1.781, P &gt; 0.05; 0.34 ± 0.08 vs. 0.34 ± 0.05, t = 0.137, P &gt; 0.05; 0.29 ± 0.06 vs. 0.40 ± 0.06, t = 5.449, P &gt; 0.05).

1234,2-s2.0-34247233326,Correlation of diffusion tensor and dynamic perfusion MR imaging metrics in normal-appearing corpus callosum: Support for primary hypoperfusion in multiple heterosis,"<p>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Hypoperfusion of the normal-appearing white matter in multiple sclerosis (MS) may be related to ischemia or secondary to hypometabolism from wallerian degeneration (WD). This study evaluated whether correlating perfusion and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) metrics in normal-appearing corpus callosum could provide support for an ischemic mechanism for hypoperfusion. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fourteen patients with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) and 17 control subjects underwent perfusion MR imaging and DTI. Absolute measures of cerebral blood volume (CBV), cerebral blood flow (CBF), and mean transit time (MTT) were calculated. Mean diffusivity (MD) and fractional anisotropy (FA) maps were computed from DTI data. After visual coregistration of perfusion and DTI images, regions of interest were placed in the genu, central body, and splenium of normal-appearing corpus callosum. Pearson product-moment correlation coefficients were calculated using mean DTI and perfusion measures in each region. RESULTS: In the RRMS group, CBF and CBV were significantly correlated with MD in the splenium (r = 0.83 and r = 0.63, respectively; both P &lt; .001) and in the central body (r = 0.86 and r = 0.65, respectively; both P &lt; .001), but not in the genu (r = 0.23 and 0.25, respectively; both P is nonsignificant). No significant correlations were found between MTT and DTI measures or between FA and any perfusion measure in the RRMS group. No significant correlations between diffusion and perfusion metrics were found in control subjects. CONCLUSION: In the normal-appearing corpus callosum of patients with RRMS, decreasing perfusion is correlated with decreasing MD. These findings are more consistent with what would be expected in primary ischemia than in secondary hypoperfusion from WD.</p>"
1235,2-s2.0-33947725538,Progression of non-age-related callosal brain atrophy in multiple sclerosis: A 9-year longitudinal MRI study representing four decades of disease development,"<p>Background: In multiple sclerosis (MS), multiple periventricular 0esions are commonly the first findings on MRI. However, most of these MS lesions are clinically silent. The brain atrophy rate has shown better correlation to physical disability, but it is not clear how atrophy develops over decades. Corpus callosum forms the roof of the third and lateral ventricles. The corpus callosum area (CCA) in a midsagittal image is age independent in a normal adult population up to the seventh decade; therefore it can be used as a marker for non-age-related, pathological brain atrophy. Objectives: To investigate whether and how CCA decreases in size over time in patients with MS. Methods: In a clinical observational study, 37 patients with MS with a wide range of disease duration at baseline (1-33 years) were followed. Three different MS courses were represented. The mean of individual MRI follow-up was 9 years. Multiple sclerosis severity score (MSSS) was also applied to evaluate disability at baseline and after 9 years of follow-up. Results: A significant decrease in CCA over 9 years (p&lt;0.001) and a persisting association between CCA and the disability status were found. The atrophy rate was similar ever four decades of MS for all MS courses. The mean annual CCA decrease was 9.25 mm<sup>2</sup> (1.8%). Surprisingly, atrophy rate did not correlate with sex, disease duration, age at MS onset or MS course. Conclusions: Serial evaluations of CCA might be a robust method in monitoring a non-age-related decrease in CCA, reflecting progression of irreversible destructive changes in MS.</p>"
1236,2-s2.0-37649005062,Corpus callosum index: A practical method for long-term follow-up in multiple sclerosis,"<p>Rather than acute inflammation, long-standing multiple sclerosis (MS) course is hallmarked by relentless axonal loss and brain atrophy, both with subtle clinical expression and scarcely visible on conventional MRI studies. Brain atrophy imaging has sophisticated methodological requirements, not always practical and accessible to most centers. Corpus callosum (CC) is a major inter-hemispheric white matter bundle, grossly affected by long term MS and easily assessed by MRI. To determine whether a practical imaging method can reliably follow presumed axonal loss in patients with progressive MS, we designed a 5-year prospective open label study, enrolling 128 consecutive patients (75 relapsing-remitting (RR) and 53 secondary-progressive (SP)), on regular immunomodulatory therapy compared to control group, formed by 23 patients with MRI considered normal. On a conventional best mid-saggital T1W, CC index (CCI) was obtained by measuring anterior, medium and posterior segments of CC, normalized to its greatest anteroposterior diameter using an orthogonal semi-automated linear system. CCI was measured at baseline and at least once yearly. Results were plotted intra-individually; baseline values were used as reference. At baseline, CCI was able to distinguish SP patients from RR and controls, and on follow-up, despite some overlap, demonstrated a progressive reduction from baseline on both RR and SP groups compared to controls. From the third year on, difference between SP and RR patients reached statistical significance, which did not correlated with disability measured by EDSS. So, a corpus callosum index proved practical and feasible to longitudinally demonstrate morphometric callosal changes with potential to be used as a tool for long-term follow-up, mostly in SP patients.</p>"

1238,2-s2.0-33846640175,The Adult Neural Stem Cell Niche: Lessons for Future Neural Cell Replacement Strategies,"<p>Success in treating neurologic disorders with NSCs depends not only on a detailed understanding of the cellular and molecular biology of NSCs but on insight into pathologic processes of the diseases being treated. Diseases in which only one or a few cell types are lost may be more amenable to cell replacement strategies. Although the authors have mentioned Parkinson's disease in this review and have focused the discussion on neurogenesis, cell replacement for demyelinating disorders (eg, multiple sclerosis) may be more approachable in that glial cell replacement does not necessarily require synaptic integration of the grafted cell into complex neuronal circuits. Adult and ES cell-derived NSCs can be induced to generate oligodendrocyte precursors [98,99], and the SVZ gives rise to oligodendrocytes in vivo [100,101]; thus, the study of the SVZ niche is also likely to advance the development of remyelination therapies. The potential of glial-restricted progenitors is nicely reviewed elsewhere [102] (and by Keyoung and his colleagues in this issue). The adult SVZ and SGZ have many more lessons for us in the pursuit of neuronal or glial cell replacement therapies. Although there are many parallels between adult brain germinal zones and embryonic brain development, certain gene functions may be unique to adult NSCs and their niches. For instance, as compared with NSCs in development, adult brain NSCs face the additional challenge of requiring prolonged (up to years) self-renewal. Thus, the molecular ""secrets"" of a durable self-renewal NSC mechanism may only be learned from the adult brain, and harnessing the molecular determinants of such long-lasting self-renewal should aid in the development of NSC-based cell replacement strategies. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

However, the occurrence and processes leading to this alteration are not yet determined. Goal and methods: To better characterize the onset and progression of CC atrophy from the early stage of MS, we performed a two-year follow-up magnetic resonance imaging/magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRI/ MRSI) exploration of CC in 24 patients with clinically isolated syndrome. These patients were explored using the same protocol at month (M)6, M12 and M24. MRI/MRSI techniques were applied to measure CC volume, and relative concentrations of N-acetylaspartate (NAA), creatine/ phosphocreatine (Cr) and choline-containing compounds (Cho). A group of matched controls was also explored. Results: Atrophy of CC, not present at baseline, was observed at M12 and progressed over the second year (M24). At baseline, a decrease in relative NAA level was observed in the anterior and posterior body of CC, with normalization during the follow-up period. In the anterior body, an increase in relative Cho level was observed, with normalization at M6. Normal relative Cr levels were observed at all time points in all sub-regions. The rate of CC atrophy was correlated with the change in the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) during the follow-up period. Conclusion: These results suggest that CC atrophy appears over a period of one year after the first acute inflammatory episode, and that this atrophy is accompanied, especially in the anterior body of CC, by a normalization of the relative Cho levels, marker of acute inflammation, and NAA levels, marker of neuronal dysfunction and/or loss. © 2007 SAGE Publications.</p>"
1240,2-s2.0-33846081868,Serial in vivo MR tracking of magnetically labeled neural spheres transplanted in chronic EAE mice,"<p>Neural stem cell (NSC) transplantation has been shown to attenuate the severity of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of multiple sclerosis (MS). Central to the future success of NSC transplantation in MS is the ability of transplanted cells to migrate from the site of transplantation to relevant foci of disease. Using magnetically labeled mouse neurospheres and human embryonic stem cell (hESC)-derived neurospheres, we applied serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to assess the biodynamics of transplanted cell migration in a chronic mouse EAE model. Magnetic labeling did not affect the in vitro and in vivo characteristics of cells as multipotential precursors. Cell migration occurred along white matter (WM) tracts (especially the corpus callosum (CC), fimbria, and internal capsule), predominantly early in the acute phase of disease, and in an asymmetric manner. The distance of cell migration correlated well with clinical severity of disease and the number of microglia in the WM tracts, supporting the notion that inflammatory signals promote transplanted cell migration. This study shows for the first time that hESC-derived neural precursors also respond to tissue signals in an MS model, similarly to rodent cells. The results are directly relevant for designing and optimizing cell therapies for MS, and achieving a better understanding of in vivo cell dynamics and cell-tissue interactions. © 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.</p>"
1241,2-s2.0-34250628450,Identifying reliable change in tactile temporal thresholds in multiple sclerosis: Test-retest reliability,"<p>Background: Tactile temporal thresholds are typically significantly higher (ie, prolonged) in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients when compared to controls and increase significantly during relapses, probably reflecting integrity of conduction across a portion of the corpus callosum. As part of an ongoing validation study of tactile temporal thresholds, the test-retest reliability of these thresholds was examined in patients with MS. Methods: Tactile temporal thresholds were measured in 61 MS patients during two separate test sessions within three weeks. Test-retest reliability and the standard error of measurement were calculated. The threshold of change in tactile temporal thresholds in MS patients that would correspond to real change beyond measurement error with 95% certainty was also calculated. Results: The test retest reliability of this measure of tactile temporal thresholds was 0.93. The threshold indicating change beyond chance or measurement error with 95% certainty was 19 ms. Conclusions: This measure of tactile temporal thresholds has excellent test retest reliability and a change of greater than 19 ms is highly likely to represent real change. This measure is promising as a precise, reliable outcome measure in MS. © 2006 SAGE Publications.</p>"

Some limitations of this measure may be accounted for by complex structural and temporal factors that become active at the initiation of injury, but are not immediately expressed.

1243,2-s2.0-33750739263,Pattern of hemodynamic impairment in multiple sclerosis: Dynamic susceptibility contrast perfusion MR imaging at 3.0 T,"<p>This study aimed to determine regional pattern of tissue perfusion in the normal-appearing white matter (NAWM) of patients with primary-progressive (PP), relapsing-remitting (RR) multiple sclerosis (MS) and healthy controls, and to investigate the association between perfusion abnormalities and clinical disability. Using dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) perfusion MRI at 3 T, we studied 22 patients with clinically definite MS, 11 with PP-MS and 11 with RR-MS and 11 age- and gender-matched healthy volunteers. The MRI protocol included axial dual-echo, dynamic susceptibility contrast enhanced (DSC) T2*-weighted and post-contrast T1-weighted images. Absolute cerebral blood flow (CBF), cerebral blood volume (CBV) and mean transit time (MTT) were measured in the periventricular, frontal, occipital NAWM and in the splenium of the corpus callosum. Compared to controls, CBF and CBV were significantly lower in all NAWM regions in both PP-MS patients (p values from &lt; 0.0001 to 0.001) and RR-MS (p values from &lt; 0.0001 to 0.020). Compared to RR-MS, PP-MS patients showed significantly lower CBF in the periventricular NAWM (p = 0.002) and lower CBV in the periventricular and frontal NAWM (p values: 0.0029 and 0.022). EDSS was significantly correlated with the periventricular CBF (r = - 0.48, p = 0.0016) and with the periventricular and frontal CBV (r = - 0.42, p = 0.015; r = - 0.35, p = 0.038, respectively). This study suggests that the hemodynamic abnormalities of NAWM have clinical relevance in patients with MS.

1244,2-s2.0-33750522790,Ipsilateral silent period: A marker of callosal conduction abnormality in early relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis?,"<p>Objective: The corpus callosum (CC) is commonly affected in multiple sclerosis (MS). The ipsilateral silent period (iSP) is a putative electrophysiological marker of callosal demyelination. The purpose of this study was to re-assess, under recently established optimised protocol conditions [Jung P., Ziemann U. Differences of the ipsilateral silent period in small hand muscles. Muscle Nerve in press.], its diagnostic sensitivity in MS, about which conflicting results were reported in previous studies. Methods: ISP measurements (onset, duration, and depth) were obtained in the abductor pollicis brevis (APB) muscle of either hand in 49 patients with early relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) (mean EDSS, 1.3). Standard central motor conduction times to the APB (CMCT<sub>APB</sub>) and tibial anterior muscles (CMCT<sub>TA</sub>), and magnetic resonance images (MRI) were also obtained. Results: ISP measurements showed a similar diagnostic sensitivity (28.6%) as CMCT<sub>APB</sub> (24.5%), while diagnostic sensitivities of CMCT<sub>TA</sub> (69.4%) and MRI of the CC (78.6%) were much higher. Prolongation of iSP duration was the most sensitive single iSP measure. ISP prolongation occurred more frequently when CMCT<sub>APB</sub> to the same hand was also prolonged (40.0% vs. 8.4%, p &lt; 0.0001). The correlation between iSP duration and CMCT<sub>APB</sub> was significant (Pearson's r = 0.24, p &lt; 0.02), suggesting that iSP duration can be contaminated by demyelination of the contralateral corticospinal tract. ISP duration did not correlate with MRI abnormalities of the CC. Conclusions: ISP measures are neither a sensitive nor a specific marker of callosal conduction abnormality in early RRMS. © 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.</p>"
1245,2-s2.0-33845762776,Susac syndrome in four male patients,"<p>PURPOSE: To report the clinical and imaging features in four male patients presenting with Susac syndrome, a microangiopathy affecting the brain, the retina, and the cochlea. METHODS: Retrospective review of clinical data, fluorescein angiograms, and magnetic resonance imaging findings in these four cases. RESULTS: All four patients were young men (range, 20-35 years). The axiomatic triad of ocular, cochlear, and neurologic involvement was present in three patients. Neurologic symptoms were absent in the fourth one. Fluorescein angiography showed arteriolar wall hyperfluorescence in all four patients. Magnetic resonance images showed in three patients multifocal hyperintense lesions in the white matter and the corpus callosum with typical involvement of the central fibers. Therapeutic modalities and clinical course are described. Three patients had a follow-up of 3, 5, and 13 years with complete remission of the disease within 1 year in all three cases. One patient had severe neuropsychological sequelae. CONCLUSION: Susac syndrome seems to be less unusual in men than previously reported. Though presenting as a self-limited monophasic course disease in most cases, it may result in severe neuropsychological sequelae. Early diagnosis of the syndrome is enabled by the combination of the ophthalmologic, audiometric, and brain magnetic resonance features. © The Ophthalmic Communications Society, Inc.</p>"
1246,2-s2.0-33750454109,Identification of fibers at risk for degeneration by diffusion tractography in patients at high risk for MS after a clinically isolated syndrome,"<p>Purpose: Focal inflammatory/demyelinatlng lesions are thought to be the source of Wallerian degeneration or other injury to local, transiting fiber tracts in the brain or spinal cord in multiple sclerosis (MS). A methodology is established to isolate connections between focal demyelinatlng lesions and intersecting fibers to permit explicit analyses of the pathology of secondary fiber injury distant from the focal lesion. Materials and Methods: A strategy is described and feasibility demonstrated in three patients with a clinically isolated syndrome and positive MRI (at high risk for MS). The strategy utilizes streamtube diffusion tractography to identify neuronal fibers that intersect a focal lesion and pass through a region of interest, in this case the corpus callosum, where distal (to focal lesion) interrogation can be accomplished. Results: A sizeable fraction of the normal appearing white matter (NAWM) in the early stages of disease can be defined in the corpus callosum, which is distinctive in that this tissue connects to distant demyelinating lesions. Conclusion: The new class of tissue called fibers-at-risk for degeneration (FAR) can be identified and interrogated by a variety of quantitative MRI methodologies to better understand neuronal degeneration in MS. © 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.</p>"
1247,2-s2.0-33748420494,Effects of commissural de- and remyelination on motor skill behaviour in the cuprizone mouse model of multiple sclerosis,"<p>Feeding of copper chelator cuprizone induces reversible demyelination, predominantly of the corpus callosum in C57/Bl6 mice. With the availability of knockout and transgenic mice, this animal model of multiple sclerosis has increasingly attracted scientists to study the roles of various factors involved in de- and remyelination. However, central motor deficits have not been reported in this model so far. In the present study, we introduce a novel murine motor test, the motor skill sequence (MOSS). This test is designed to detect latent deficits in motor performance. In a first step, we habituated mice to training wheels composed of regularly spaced crossbars till maximal wheel-running performance was achieved. Subsequently, the animals were exposed to wheels with irregularly spaced crossbars demanding high-level motor coordination. This two-step approach minimized a contribution of cardiopulmonary and musculoskeletal training to any improvement of motor performance on the complex wheels. We applied the MOSS test under acute cuprizone-induced demyelination as well as in remyelinated mice after cuprizone withdrawal. Demyelinated animals on a cuprizone diet already showed reduced running performance on the training wheels as compared to control animals. This was even more pronounced when these mice were subsequently exposed to the complex wheels. In contrast, remyelinated animals after cuprizone withdrawal did not exhibit any functional impairment on the training wheels. Latent motor skill deficits were however revealed on the complex wheels, although clearly ameliorated as compared to acutely demyelinated mice. Our results show that latent motor deficits of cuprizone-induced demyelination and after remyelination can be quantified by MOSS. This motor test thus expands the usability of the cuprizone model to a functional level and might also be applicable to other animal models of human CNS diseases associated with subtle motor deficits of central origin. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

1249,2-s2.0-33750597533,"MRI and the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis: expanding the concept of ""no better explanation""","<p>Although the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis relies on the demonstration of disease dissemination in space and time, the exclusion of other neurological disorders is also essential. The limited specificity of abnormalities disclosed by MRI may increase the likelihood of diagnosis of multiple sclerosis in patients affected by other disorders. The available criteria for diagnosis of multiple sclerosis have not taken advantage of the potential of MRI to detect features ""not suggestive"" of multiple sclerosis. Recognition of such features in the work-up of patients suspected of having multiple sclerosis may reduce the likelihood of a false positive diagnosis of the disorder in some, while suggesting the correct alternative diagnosis in other patients. On the basis of this, a workshop of the European MAGNIMS (Magnetic Resonance Network in Multiple Sclerosis) was held to define a series of MRI red flags in the setting of clinically suspected multiple sclerosis that is derived from evidence-based findings and educated guesses. The presence of such red flags should alert clinicians to reconsider the differential diagnosis more extensively.

1250,2-s2.0-33749371142,Loss of interhemispheric inhibition in patients with multiple sclerosis is related to corpus callosum atrophy,"<p>Axonal injury and loss in the corpus callosum (CC) is characteristic of the pathology of multiple sclerosis (MS). Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) potentially allows neurophysiological consequences of this interhemispheric axonal loss to be defined quantitatively. Here we have used 3T fMRI to study the activation in the contralateral primary sensorimotor cortex and deactivation (mediated by transcallosal tracts) in the homologous ipsilateral region in 14 patients with MS and in 14 matched healthy controls during a simple hand-tapping task. Both healthy controls and MS patients showed similar activation in the motor cortex contralateral to the hand moved, but the patients showed a significantly smaller relative deactivation in the ipsilateral motor cortex (P = 0.002). The difference was accounted for by the sub-group of MS patients who previously had impairment of motor function of the hand tested (MS-phd). The CC of the whole patient group was significantly thinner than for the controls (P = 0.001). Atrophy of the CC was correlated with loss of deactivation for the whole patient group (r = -0.50, P = 0.035), but particularly for MS-phd (r = -0.914, P = 0.004). Interhemispheric physiological inhibition thus is impaired in patients with MS, potentially contributing to impairment of motor control. This work suggests one way in which FMRI monitoring of the transcallosal interactions in motor cortex could become a tool for evaluation of therapies that may enhance function in reversibly impaired pathways. © 2006 Springer-Verlag.</p>"
1251,2-s2.0-33748792584,Does high-field MR imaging have an influence on the classification of patients with clinically isolated syndromes according to current diagnostic MR imaging criteria for multiple sclerosis?,"<p>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Current MR imaging criteria for multiple sclerosis (MS) do not specify the magnetic field strength. The aim of this study was to investigate whether different MR imaging field strengths, specifically high-field MR imaging, have an impact on the classification of patients with clinically isolated syndromes suggestive of MS, according to MR imaging and diagnostic criteria. METHODS: In a prospective intraindividual comparative study, we examined 40 patients with clinically isolated syndromes (CIS) consecutively with a 1.5T and 3T MR imaging system, including axial sections of T2 turbo spin-echo, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery, and T1 spin-echo, before and after injection of gadolinium-diethylene-triaminepentaacetic acid. Constant resolution parameters were used for both field strengths. High-signal-intensity white matter lesions with a size of &gt;3 mm were counted and categorized according to their anatomic location in infratentorial, callosal, juxtacortical, periventricular, and other white matter areas. Assessment of the fulfilled Barkhof MR imaging and McDonald diagnostic criteria was made separately for both field strengths in every patient. RESULTS: Eleven patients fulfilled more MR imaging criteria at 3T. Two of these patients fulfilled the criterion of dissemination in space (DIS) according to the first definition of McDonald criteria, which is based on imaging criteria alone. Another patient had DIS only at 3T, according to the second definition of the McDonald criteria including CSF parameters. CONCLUSION: MR field strength, specifically high-field MR imaging, has a substantial influence on the classification of patients with CIS according to imaging and a mild influence on the classification according diagnostic criteria for MS, leading to consequences for prognostic classification, imaging guidelines, and clinical trials.</p>"

Methods: Conventional and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) were performed in 110 patients with recurrent demyelinating diseases. From them, 31 patients were definitely diagnosed as RRMS and 26 patients as RNMO. The mean diffusivity (MD), fractional anisotropy (FA), primary eigenvalue (λ<sub>1</sub>), and transverse eigenvalues (λ<sub>2-3</sub>) from the region of the corpus callosum on the mid-sagittal FA image were measured and taken as the discriminative indices. The performance of these indices for differentiating RNMO from RRMS was observed. Results: The average MD, FA, λ<sub>1</sub> and λ<sub>2-3</sub> of the corpus callosum of RRMS patients were significantly different from those of RNMO patients (P&lt;0.001). RNMO patients could be discriminated from RRMS by choosing appropriate cut-offs (MD=9.31 × 10<sup>-4</sup> mm<sup>2</sup>/s, FA=0.685; λ<sub>2-3</sub> = 4.98 × 10<sup>-4</sup> mm<sup>2</sup>/s) of the corpus callosum. The accuracy for this differential diagnosis was 92.98% for MD, 89.47% for FA and 91.23% for λ<sub>2-3</sub>, respectively.

1253,2-s2.0-33646817416,Age increases axon loss associated with primary demyelination in cuprizone-induced demyelination in C57BL/6 mice,"<p>Axon loss is recognised as a significant contributor to the progression of the disability associated with multiple sclerosis. Although evidence of axon damage is found in areas of chronic demyelination it is more frequently seen in association with acute demyelination. This study compares the incidence of axon degeneration associated with the areas undergoing demyelination in young adult (8-10 weeks) and aged (6-7 months) C57BL/6 mice in cuprizone intoxication; a widely used model of demyelination. The incidence of axon transection, as indicated by the presence of SMI 32 positive axonal spheroids, and evidence of axon loss in the medial corpus callosum, were significantly greater in aged mice, as was the magnitude of the macrophage and astrocyte response to demyelination. Aged C57BL/6 mice are thus more prone to axon degeneration in association with demyelination than young adult mice. A retrospective study indicated that the incidence of axon degeneration was much higher in C57BL/6 mice than in the Swiss albino mice used in the early cuprizone intoxication studies which were fed much higher doses of cuprizone. These results indicate both a genetic and age susceptibility to demyelination-associated axon transection. © 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.</p>"
1254,2-s2.0-33747602295,Diffusion tensor imaging in the assessment of normal-appearing brain tissue damage in relapsing neuromyelitis optica,"<p>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Normal-appearing brain tissue (NABT) damage was established in multiple sclerosis by histology, MR spectroscopy, magnetization transfer imaging and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). However, whether this phenomenon can be detected in relapsing neuromyelitis optica (RNMO) remains unclear. The aim of this study was to use DTI to investigate the presence of NABT damage in RNMO patients and its possible mechanism. METHODS: Conventional MR imaging and DTI scans were performed in 16 patients with RNMO without visible lesions on brain MR imaging and in 16 sex- and age-matched healthy control subjects. Histogram analysis of mean diffusivity (MD) and fractional anisotropy (FA) was performed in the entire brain tissue (BT), white matter (WM), and gray matter (GM). Region of interest (ROI) analysis of MD and FA was also performed in WM regions connected with the spinal white matter tracts or optic nerve (including medulla oblongata, cerebral peduncle, internal capsule, and optic radiation), in corpus callosum without direct connection with them, and in some GM regions. RESULTS: From histogram analysis, we found the RNMO group had a higher average MD of the BT, WM, and GM, a lower average MD peak height and a higher average MD peak location of the GM, and a higher average FA peak height of the WM than did the control group. From ROI analysis, compared with control subjects, RNMO patients had a higher average MD and a lower average FA in ROIs of WM connected with the spinal white matter tracts or optic nerve and a normal average MD and FA in corpus callosum without direct connection with them. In addition, a high average MD was found in parietal GM in these patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings confirm the presence of abnormal diffusion in brain tissue in patients with RNMO and suggest that secondary degeneration caused by lesions in the spinal cord and optic nerve might be an important mechanism for this abnormality.</p>"

We report the case of a 15-year-old Libyan girl who developed headache, gait disturbances, and vomiting in Libya. Due to multiple high-density lesions in the T2-weighted MRI pictures of the brain with an exceptional isolated lesion of the corpus callosum, diagnosis of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis was made. Because recurrent cycles of prednisolone treatment failed, the girl was transferred to our hospital. In addition to neurologic complaints such as gait disturbances, ataxia, and hypesthesia of both legs, she then developed uveitis as well as severe ulcerations of the mouth and genital region. Diagnosis of neuro-Behçet's disease was made. Under treatment with prednisolone and azathioprine, the girl's condition improved rapidly so that we were able to discharge her home after 4 weeks. Discussion. The presented disease course of neuro-Behçet's disease is quite exceptional in children, because neurologic symptoms rarely precede the typical clinical findings of Behçet's disease in children. Furthermore, an isolated, high-density MRI lesion of the corpus callosum, like in the present case, has not been described in neuro-Behçet's disease before. Therefore, it must be recognized that neurologic symptoms may precede Behçet's disease by months even in children and that this disorder must be incorporated into the differential diagnosis of miscellaneous neurologic disorders. © Springer Medizin Verlag 2004.</p>"

1258,2-s2.0-33646121492,Insights into brain microstructure from the T<inf>2</inf> distribution,"<p>T<sub>2</sub> weighting is particularly sensitive, but notoriously unspecific, to a wide range of brain pathologies. However, careful measurement and analysis of the T<sub>2</sub> decay curve from brain tissue promise to provide much improved pathological specificity. In vivo T<sub>2</sub> measurement requires accurate 180 pulses and appropriate manipulation of stimulated echoes; the most common approach is to acquire multiple echoes from a single slice. The T<sub>2</sub> distribution, a plot of component amplitude as a function of T<sub>2</sub>, can be estimated using an algorithm capable of fitting a multi-exponential T<sub>2</sub> decay with no a priori assumptions about the number of exponential components. T<sub>2</sub> distributions from normal brain show peaks from myelin water, intra/extracellular water and cerebral spinal fluid; they can be used to provide estimates of total water content (total area under the T<sub>2</sub> distribution) and myelin water fraction (MWF, fractional area under the myelin water peak), a measure believed to be related to myelin content. Experiments on bovine brain suggest that magnetization exchange between water pools plays a minor role in the T<sub>2</sub> distribution. Different white matter structures have different MWFs. In normal white matter (NWM), MWF is not correlated with the magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) or the diffusion tensor fractional anisotropy (FA); hence it provides unique information about brain microstructure. Normal-appearing white matter (NAWM) in multiple sclerosis (MS) brain possesses a higher water content and lower MWF than controls, consistent with histopathological findings. Multiple sclerosis lesions demonstrate great heterogeneity in MWF, presumably due to varying myelin contents of these focal regions of pathology. Subjects with schizophrenia were found to have significantly reduced MWF in the minor forceps and genu of the corpus callosum when compared to controls, suggesting that reduced frontal lobe myelination plays a role in schizophrenia. In normal controls, frontal lobe myelination was positively correlated with both age and education; this result was not observed in subjects with schizophrenia. A strong correlation between MWF and the optical density from the luxol fast blue histological stain for myelin was observed in formalin-fixed brain, supporting the use of the MWF as an in vivo myelin marker. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

At the early stage of differentiation, in particular, the helix-loop-helix transcription factors Olig1 and Olig2 have been shown to be essential for oligodendrocyte lineage determination. In view of the possible application of NSCs as a source for remyelinating cell transplants in demyelinating diseases (e.g., multiple sclerosis), in vitro procedures need to be developed to drive the oligodendrocyte differentiation process. Mere culture in medium supplemented with major embryonic oligodendrogenic induction factors, such as Sonic hedgehog, results in oligodendrocyte differentiation of only about 10% of NSCs. We previously showed that induction of Olig1 expression by gene transfection could indeed initiate the first stage of oligodendrocyte differentiation in NSCs, but appeared to be unable to generate fully mature, functional oligodendrocytes. In this study, we transfected NSCs isolated from the embryonic mouse brain with the Olig2 gene and found that the introduced overexpression of Olig2 could induce the development of fully mature oligodendrocytes expressing the transcription factor Nkx2.2 and all major myelin-specific proteins. Moreover, Olig2-transfected NSCs, in contrast to nontransfected NSCs, developed into actively remyelinating oligodendrocytes after transplantation into the corpus callosum of long-term cuprizone-fed mice, an animal model for demyelination. Our results show that transfection of genes encoding for oligodendrogenic transcription factors can be an efficient way to induce the differentiation of NSCs into functional oligodendrocytes. ©AlphaMed Press.</p>"
1260,2-s2.0-33645405349,Upregulation of the stress-associated gene p8 in mouse models of demyelination and in multiple sclerosis tissues,"<p>Cuprizone-induced demyelination is a mouse model of multiple sclerosis (MS) as cuprizone-fed mice exhibit neuroinflammation and demyelination in the brain. Upon removal of cuprizone from the diet, inflammation is resolved and reparative remyelination occurs. In an Affymetrix Gene-Chip analysis, the stress-associated gene p8 was strongly upregulated (&gt;10×) during cuprizone-induced demyelination but not remyelination. We verified this upregulation (&gt;15×) of p8 in the CNS during demyelination by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). This upregulation is brain-specific, as p8 is not elevated in the liver, lung, kidney, spleen, and heart of cuprizone-treated mice. We also localized the cellular source of p8 during cuprizone treatment, and further found elevated expression during embryogenesis but not in normal adult brain. Compared with wild-type controls, the death of oligodendrocytes in p8<sup>-/-</sup> mice is delayed, as is microglial recruitment to areas of demyelination. The corpus callosum of p8<sup>-/-</sup> mice demyelinates at a slower rate than wild-type mice, suggesting that p8 exacerbates CNS inflammation and demyelination. Enhanced expression of p8 is also observed in the spinal cords of mice with acute experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) induced by PLP<sub>139-151</sub> peptide (10×). Increased expression is detected during disease onset and expression wanes during the remission phase. Finally, p8 is found upregulated (8×) in post-mortem tissue from MS patients and is higher in the plaque tissue compared with adjacent normal-appearing white and gray matter. Thus, p8 is an excellent candidate as a novel biomarker of demyelination. © 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.</p>"

1262,2-s2.0-33646506861,Vitamin B12 deficiency can mimic multiple sclerosis - Report of two cases,"<p>Background: Because of heterogeneous manifestations of MS, an incorrect diagnosis is not uncommon. Tests supporting the diagnosis of MS, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination and evoked potentials help to make diagnosis as early as possible. One of the diseases that is usually considered in differential diagnosis of MS is vitamin B12 deficiency. Differential diagnosis however may be difficult because neurological and hematological disorder may develop independently and with various intensity, pernicious anemia may respond to steroid therapy, MRI findings in vitamin B12 deficiency may be similar to that in MS and MS may coexist with low vitamin B12 level. Here, we present two cases of Vitamin B12 deficiency in young women that was misdiagnosed as MS. Case Report: In both cases besides the neurological symptoms of gait disturbances and paresthesia, MR scan showed high signal of T2-weighted imaging lesions periventricular and affecting corpus callosum. In one case, oligoclonal bands were positive in CSF examination. Both patients were diagnosed as MS and treated with high dose of methylprednisolone with no improvement. Since the level of vitamin B12 was found lower in both cases, they were treated with intramuscular injection of vitamin B12 and improved gradually. In both, macrocytic anemia was present but independently of neurological symptoms. Conclusions: However clinical features and MRI findings closely resembled signs of MS, low vitamin B12 level and good response to vitamin B12 supplementation allowed to establish diagnosis of vitamin B12 deficiency.</p>"

We observed that HU210 dramatically reduced peroxynitrite- induced axonal injury in rats receiving adrenalectomy and corticosterone replacement treatment. These results suggest that the ameliorating effects of cannabinoids on axonal injury associated with multiple sclerosis are achieved by its direct action, but not by its indirect action to elevate the serum corticosterone levels. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

1264,2-s2.0-33645318432,Relevance of callosal and periventricular MRI lesions to oligoclonal bands in multiple sclerosis,"<p>Objectives - To evaluate the association between callosal or periventricular lesions, and the presence of oligoclonal IgG bands (OB) or the IgG index in Japanese patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). Materials and methods - Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was studied in 34 Japanese clinically definite MS cases. Sagittal 2-mm fast fluid-attenuated inversion-recovery (FLAIR) imaging was added to the routine MRI studies. Results - Among the 34 patients, 20 (59%) were OB positive. Among the 20 patients with OB-positive MS, 17 (85%) had callosal lesions, although only two (14%) of 14 OB-negative MS patients had callosal lesions. The periventricular lesion area was significantly larger in the OB-positive patients compared with the OB-negative patients. Conclusions - The present study clearly demonstrated a strong association between the periventricular lesions and OB in Japanese MS. Certain OB-related immune mechanisms may contribute to the development of callosal and periventricular lesions in MS. OB may be an important factor to understand the pathomechanisms of MS lesions. © Blackwell Munksgaard 2005.</p>"

These differences are present in young and aged rodents and are independent of strain and species. Proteolipid protein and carbonic anhydrase-II transcripts, measured by real-time PCR, are approximately two to three times greater in males. Myelin basic protein and 2′,3′-cyclic nucleotide 3′- phosphodiesterase, measured by Western blots, are 20-160% greater in males compared with females. Surprisingly, both generation of new glia and apoptosis of glia, including oligodendrocytes, are approximately two times greater in female corpus callosum. These results indicate that the lifespan of oligodendrocytes is shorter in females than in males. Castration of males produces a female phenotype characterized by fewer oligodendrocytes and increased generation of new glia. These findings indicate that exogenous androgens differentially affect the lifespan of male and female oligodendrocytes, and they can override the endogenous production of neurosteroids. The data imply that turnover of myelin is greater in females than in males. μ-Calpain, a protease upregulated in degeneration of myelin, is dramatically increased at both transcriptional and translational levels in females compared with males. These morphological, molecular, and biochemical data show surprisingly large differences in turnover of oligodendrocytes and myelin between sexes. We discuss the potential significance of these differences to multiple sclerosis, a sexually dimorphic disease, whose progression is altered by exogenous hormones.

We report on a patient with a longstanding secondary progressive MS and six episodes of recurring hypothermia down to 29.9°C with associated hypotension, bradycardia, coagulopathy and electrolyte dysequilibrium. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated severe involvement of the corpus callosum with an associated lesion in the right posterior thalamus. These findings may link hypothermia in MS with callosal and associated thalamic pathology to Shapiro's syndrome, where agenesis of the corpus callosum and associated abnormalities are related to episodic spontaneous hypothermia. In MS, hypothermic episodes may be triggered by preceding infections, as shown in the present case. © 2006 Edward Arnold (Publishers) Ltd.</p>"
1267,2-s2.0-44449119519,Effects of mid-sagittal plane perturbation and image interpolation on corpus callosum area calculation,"<p>The corpus callosum (CC) is an anatomical structure that bridges the two brain hemispheres. It contains white matter tracts that participate in inter hemispheric communication. In multiple sclerosis (MS), the CC can have discrete lesions (MS plaques) or generalized tissue loss (atrophy), both of which affect the CC size. However, detection of changes in CC size depends on accurate identification of the mid-sagittal plane (MSP) in three dimensional space. We determine the error introduced in CC area when the plane of measurement is altered. Our contribution is the study of the effects of plane alteration and image interpolation. The interpolation techniques investigated are tricubic, trilinear and nearest neighbor. For measuring this error, we semi-automatically segment the CC in an MR volume. The voxels of the segmented volume are coded as binary values based on their position either inside or outside the CC. We then generate an MSP though reslicing and resampling of the volumetric data for varying values of MSP orientation and translation parameters. Finally we calculate the area of the CC whose cross section is embedded in the MSP. © 2006 IEEE.</p>"

Typical MRI measures of disease burden in MS demonstrate modest to poor correlation with disability. Functional MRI and DTI-based fiber tracking were used to define the interhemispheric white matter pathway connecting bilateral supplementary motor areas (SMA) in 16 MS patients sand 16 control subjects. Fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), longitudinal (λ<sub>1</sub>) and transverse diffusivity (λ<sub>2</sub>) were measured along this pathway in all subjects. Mean FA was 0.587 ± 0.032 for patients and 0.608 ± 0.020 for controls (P &lt; 0.02). Mean MD was (0.821 ± 0.055) × 10<sup>-3</sup> mm<sup>2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> for patients and (0.770 ± 0.020) × 10<sup>-3</sup> mm<sup>2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> for controls (P &lt; 0.004).

In addition, the correlation between the Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite (MSFC) and transverse diffusivity was -0.341 (P &lt; 0.05). The component test of the MSFC most related to the SMA pathway studied with our MRI method (Nine-hole Peg Test) showed significant correlation with transverse diffusivity (r = 0.392, P &lt; 0.02), indicating that probing functional pathways with MRI measures can lead to a better reflection of disease status. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

1270,2-s2.0-33646779566,Endogenous cell repair of chronic demyelination,"<p>In multiple sclerosis lesions, remyelination typically fails with repeated or chronic demyelinating episodes and results in neurologic disability. Acute demyelination models in rodents typically exhibit robust spontaneous remyelination that prevents appropriate evaluation of strategies for improving conditions of insufficient remyelination. In the current study, we used a mouse model of chronic demyelination induced by continuous ingestion of 0.2% cuprizone for 12 weeks. This chronic process depleted the oligodendrocyte progenitor population and impaired oligodendrocyte regeneration. Remyelination remained limited after removal of cuprizone from the diet. Fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) expression was persistently increased in the corpus callosum of chronically demyelinated mice as compared with nonlesioned mice. We used FGF2<sup>-/-</sup> mice to determine whether removal of endogenous FGF2 promoted remyelination of chronically demyelinated areas. Wild-type and FCF2 mice exhibited similar demyelination during chronic cuprizone treatment. Importantly, in contrast to wild-type mice, the FGF2<sup>-/-</sup> mice spontaneously remyelinated completely during the recovery period after chronic demyelination. Increased remyelination in FGF2 mice correlated with enhanced oligodendroglial regeneration. FGF2 genotype did not alter the density of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells or proliferating cells after chronic demyelination. These findings indicate that attenuating FGF2 created a sufficiently permissive lesion environment for endogenous cells to effectively remyelinate viable axons even after chronic demyelination.

1271,2-s2.0-33646506651,Deleterious role of IFNγ in a toxic model of central nervous system demyelination,"<p>Interferon-γ (IFNγ) is a pleiotropic cytokine that plays an important role in many inflammatory processes, including autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS). Demyelination is a hallmark of MS and a prominent pathological feature of several other inflammatory diseases of the central nervous system, including experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, an animal model of MS. Accordingly, in this study we followed the effect of IFNγ in the demyelination and remyelination process by using an experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis model of demyelination/remyelination after exposure of mice to the neurotoxic agent cuprizone. We show that demyelination in response to cuprizone is delayed in mice lacking the binding chain of IFNγ receptor. In addition, IFNγR<sup>-/-</sup> mice exhibited an accelerated remyelination process after cuprizone was removed from the diet. Our results also indicate that the levels of IFNγ were able to modulate the microglia/macrophage recruitment to the demyelinating areas. Moreover, the accelerated regenerative response showed by the IFNγR <sup>-/-</sup> mice was associated with a more efficient recruitment of oligodendrocyte precursor cells in the demyelinated areas. In conclusion, this study suggests that IFNγ regulates the development and resolution of the demyelinating syndrome and may be associated with toxic effects on both mature oligodendrocytes and oligodendrocyte precursor cells.

1272,2-s2.0-33644844753,The role of MRI in the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis.,"<p>There is no single test that is diagnostic of MS, including MRI. The lesions detected with MRI are pathologically nonspecific. The principles of MS diagnosis are based on showing dissemination of white matter lesions in space and time. MRI is the most sensitive method for revealing asymptomatic dissemination of lesions in space and time. The pattern and evolution of MRI lesions, in the appropriate clinical setting, has made MRI abnormalities invaluable criteria for the early diagnosis of MS. The first important role for MRI in the diagnosis of MS allows for an early diagnosis of MS for CIS patients using the IP diagnostic criteria, including MRI for dissemination in space (DIS) and time (DIT). The sensitivity of diagnosing MS within the first year after a single attack is 94%, with a specificity of 83%. The MRI evidence required to support the diagnosis varies, depending on the strength of the clinical findings. Allowing a new MRI lesion to substitute for a clinical attack doubles the number of CIS patients who can be diagnosed as having MS within 1 year of symptom onset. Increasing the sensitivity of the test with more lenient criteria, as recommended by the AAN subcommittee, can result in decreased specificity. The second important role for MRI in the diagnostic work-up of suspected MS patients is to rule out alternative diagnoses obvious on MRI, such as spinal stenosis and most brain tumors. Characteristic lesions that favor MS include Dawson Fingers, ovoid lesions, corpus callosum lesions, and asymptomatic spinal cord lesions. However, other white matter diseases can have similar appearances on MRI. Persistent gadolinium enhancement greater than three months, lesions with mass effect, and meningeal enhancement suggest other disorders. A standardized MRI protocol for brain and spinal cord is crucial for comparing across studies or between centers. T2W MRI cannot distinguish between acute and chronic lesions. Gadolinium provides useful information about new lesion activity and is helpful in ruling out alternative diagnoses such as neoplasm, vascular malformations, and leptomeningeal disease. A single gadolinium-enhanced MRI can potentially provide evidence for dissemination in space and time. Spinal cord imaging is equally valuable to rule out spinal stenosis or tumor, and for detecting asymptomatic lesions when brain imaging is nondiagnostic in patients suspected of having MS. Precise criteria may be too suggestive that MS can be diagnosed by MRI and a negative MRI at the time of CIS does not rule out MS. MRI evidence plays a supportive role in what is ultimately a clinical diagnosis of MS, in the appropriate clinical situation, and always at the exclusion of alternative diagnoses.</p>"
1273,2-s2.0-31644433923,Cerebral small vessel diseases: Manifestations in young women,"<p>Purpose of review: Cerebral small vessel disease are responsible for 20-30% of ischemic strokes as well as for a considerable proportion of cerebral hemorrhages and encephalopathies. Less known than the manifestations in old age are those in young women comprising posterior encephalopathy and Susac's syndrome. Recent findings: Magnetic resonance imaging has allowed us to identify posterior encephalopathy, characterized by headache, seizures, visual disturbances and hypertension, as a frequent complication of preeclampsia/eclampsia syndrome in the perinatal and postpartum period. Magnetic resonance findings are pathognomonic with bilateral cortical-subcortical lesions in the posterior hemispheres typically sparing the calcarine fissure. Conversely, white matter lesions on magnetic resonace imaging particularly involving the corpus callosum, and a (subclinical) sensorineural hearing loss are diagnostic of the retinocochleocerebral vasculopathy called Susac's syndrome. Summary: Posterior encephalopathy can also follwo from a broad spectrum of endotheliotoxic conditions like chemotherapy, immunosuppression and sepsis. Early recognition of the disorder is decisive for a benign outcome since therapy consists of removal of precipitating factors, lowering of blood pressure and treatment with magnesium sulfate. The retinocochleocerebral vasculopathy appears to be underdiagnosed. An autoimmune-mediated arteriolopathy is presumed and the disease is nearly always monophasic. A variety of therapeutic approaches have been recommended, none of which, however, is based on anything other than anecdotal evidence. © 2006 Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins.</p>"

Unlike neurons<sup>5</sup>, white matter oligodendrocytes reportedly lack NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptors <sup>6,7</sup>. It is believed that glutamate damages oligodendrocytes, especially their precursor cells, by acting on calcium-permeable AMPA (α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid)/kainate receptors alone<sup>1-4</sup> or by reversing cystine-glutamate exchange and depriving cells of antioxidant protection<sup>8</sup>. Here we show that precursor, immature and mature oligodendrocytes in the white matter of the cerebellum and corpus callosum exhibit NMDA-evoked currents, mediated by receptors that are blocked only weakly by Mg<sup>2+</sup> and that may contain NR1, NR2C and NR3 NMDA receptor subunits. NMDA receptors are present in the myelinating processes of oligodendrocytes, where the small intracellular space could lead to a large rise in intracellular ion concentration in response to NMDA receptor activation. Simulating ischaemia led to development of an inward current in oligodendrocytes, which was partly mediated by NMDA receptors. These results point to NMDA receptors of unusual subunit composition as a potential therapeutic target for preventing white matter damage in a variety of diseases. © 2005 Nature Publishing Group.</p>"
1276,2-s2.0-33744936795,"Multiple sclerosis in childhood - Frequency, diagnostic criteria, clinical characteristic, prognosis, treatment","<p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) in childhood is rare (3 to 5%). It is divided to ""childhood"" form with onset up to 10 years and ""juvenile"" form with onset in the puberty. During the last years the number of publications treating MS in childhood has increased. MS prevails in girls. In the ""childhood"" form of MS girls are affected 3 times more frequently, and in the juvenile form- 4, 7 times. The new diagnostic criteria for MS (Mc Donald et al, 2001) are suitable for the childhood form too. The diagnosis is based on proving the dissemination of the lesions in time and in the brain structures during the clinical course and magnate resonance imaging (MRI) examinations. MRI, the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examinations and the visual evoked potentials supported the diagnosis. Clinically in the childhood form pyramidal tract signs, brain stem dysfunctions, epileptic seizures were found more frequently. The disease had relapsing, secondary-progressive and rare primary progressive course. The differentiation of the first MS attack from acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) is based on the prevalence of systemic and non-focal neurological symptoms (fever, cephalgia, weakness, vomiting, encepha-lopathy) and CSF leucocytosis, lymphocytosis and proteinor-rhachia in ADEM, while in MS, it is based on the MRI lesions in corpus callosum and in the periventricular regions. The high sensitive MRI criteria for MS prognosis and risk for relapsing course in childhood include lesions, perpendicular to the long axis of corpus callosum during the first attack and sharply distinctive hyperintense lesions. The demyelinization lesions on MRI in children are characterized by the ""giant"" size and the rare presence of nonreversible lesions (cysts, cerebral atrophy). The prognosis of MS in childhood depends of the age of the disease onset and is more unfavourable in cases with onset over 10 years of age, high attacks' frequency during the first 2 years and the severity of invalidisation during the first year. The results from the clinical effectiveness of the prophylactic treatment with Interferon beta in patients aged below 16 years were preliminary, the clinical contingent is insufficient.</p>"

Using thin-section sagittal fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images, researchers have shown that the finding of ""subcallosal striations"" correlates significantly with the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis. Using the same MR imaging technique, we describe a finding of ependymal irregularity that we call the ""Dot-Dash"" sign, which we believe to be associated with early multiple sclerosis. METHODS: Sagittal 2-mm fast fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images were obtained in 70 patients. Thirty-five patients had multiple sclerosis according to the Poser criteria, and 35 were age-matched controls. The images were reviewed in 3 blinded fashion by an experienced neuroradiologist for the presence or absence of the Dot-Dash sign. RESULTS: The correlation between the Dot-Dash sign and definite clinical multiple sclerosis is highly significant (P &lt; .001), with a sensitivity of 91.4% and a specificity of 65.7%. In the age group of ≤50 years, the sensitivity was 95.7% and the specificity, 71.9%. CONCLUSION: The Dot-Dash sign of ependymal irregularity on thin-section sagittal fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images is an early marker for multiple sclerosis, which is particularly useful in the younger patient. This finding appears to be more sensitive for early lesion detection than any other multiple sclerosis imaging finding yet described in the literature. © American Society of Neuroradiology.</p>"

The severity (reversibility) and distribution are different in various neurologic diseases (in terms of cell types, initial insults, and their mechanisms) and in patients of differing ages (with factors such as the age-dependent distribution of receptors and the maturity of the blood-brain barrier). Excitotoxic amine receptors are present in neurons, axons, glial cells, and myelin sheaths. Astrocytes and myelin sheaths, which protect synapses and axons, swell after absorbing excessive glutamate. Such cytotoxic edema seems to be transient and resolves on follow-up MR imaging. Energy failure (impaired reuptake of glutamate) is the initial insult during infarction and HIE. It usually causes irreversible excitotoxic brain injury and typically results in necrosis and atrophy. Secondary degeneration, such as wallerian degeneration, seems to be related to excitotoxic circuits via the synapses or axons. Excessive release of glutamate can cause cytotoxic edema in conditions such as seizure, infection, demyelination, and toxic metabolic disease. Such cytotoxic edema is due to excitotoxic injury with less energy failure; this type occasionally resolves on follow-up MR imaging. Diffuse axonal injury can cause the leakage of glutamate from the axon at the node of Ranvier. The distribution of lesions associated with status epilepticus seems to be related to the distribution of NMDA receptors. The severity and distribution in HIE, shaken baby syndrome, and neonatal herpes encephalitis seems to be related to increased vulnerability of the developing brain to excitotoxic injury. In organic acid disorders, structurally similar substances can cause excitotoxic injury. Receptor dysfunction can occur in metabolic conditions (phenylketonuria) and degenerative diseases (CJD). Glutamate receptor antagonists may offer attractive possibilities for future therapy as possible neuroprotectants in the management of these diseases. © American Society of Neuroradiology.</p>"

We characterized the spatial evolution of atrophy in different MS phenotypes. METHODS: Dual-echo and T1-weighted MR images were obtained in 70 patients with MS and 10 healthy control subjects at entry and after 15 months. Within-group changes in regional atrophy were assessed by applying Structural Image Evaluation Using Normalization of Atrophy software and statistical parametric mapping analysis. Reported differences are for P &lt;.001. RESULTS: During follow-up, patients with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) differences significant atrophy around the ventricular system; pericerebellar spaces; cerebellar tentorium; putamen; corpus callosum; cingulate sulcus; hippocampus; parieto-occipital fissure; lateral fissure; and frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital cortex. Patients with secondary progressive MS developed significant atrophy of the cingulate sulcus; pulvinar; caudate nucleus; anterior orbital gyros; mammillary body; fourth ventricle; and regions of frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital cortex. Patients with primary progressive MS developed significant atrophy of the bilateral central sulcus; caudate nucleus; prepontine and quadrigeminal cisterns; lateral ventricle; and regions of frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital cortex. In all phenotypes, the development of atrophy in some regions was significantly correlated with the accumulation of T2- and T1-visible lesions and clinical disability (r = -0.57 to -0.86). CONCLUSION: In MS, brain atrophy develops involving different structures in the different phenotypes. While ventricular enlargement is predominant in RRMS, cortical atrophy seems to be more important in the progressive forms. Measures of regional brain atrophy were significantly correlated with disability, suggesting that this approach is promising for bridging the gap between clinical and MR imaging findings in MS. © American Society of Neuroradiology.</p>"

The process of oligodendrocyte apoptosis in this animal model for multiple sclerosis (MS) involves early microglial activation, but no infiltration of T-lymphocytes. Therefore, this model could mimic early stages of oligodendrocyte degeneration Affected oligodendrocytes express the common neurotrophin receptor, p75<sup>NTR</sup>, a 'stress-receptor' which under certain circumstances can induce apoptosis. Only affected oligodendrocytes in MS lesions and MS animal models express this receptor.

In the present work, we aimed to determine the ability of magnification transfer imaging to better reflect the relationship between local tissue damage and functional status of MS patients. METHODS: We performed a comparative statistical mapping analysis on brain tissue magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) data measured in 18 patients with clinically isolated syndrome suggestive of MS (CISSMS) and 18 matched control subjects.

Local MTR values correlated with Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test scores in the left BA40, right BA4, right SLF, and splenium. CONCLUSION: Statistical mapping analysis of brain MTR data provides valuable information on the relationship between the location of brain tissue damage and its functional impact in patients with MS, even in the earliest stage of the disease. © American Society of Neuroradiology.</p>"
1285,2-s2.0-25644457675,'Importance sampling' in MS: Use of diffusion tensor tractography to quantify pathology related to specific impairment,"<p>Specific neurological impairments in multiple sclerosis (MS) are dependent on the pathology in clinically eloquent areas of the central nervous system. We aimed to use diffusion tensor fiber tracking to identify the pyramidal tracts and corpus callosum in MS patients, measure the apparent diffusivity within the tracts, and evaluate whether this would correlate with relevant disability scores. Dual-echo and diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DT-MRI) brain scans were obtained from 29 patients with relapsing remitting MS, and 13 age and gender matched normal controls. Voxels from pyramidal tracts and corpus callosum were automatically identified using a tractography based algorithm. Mean apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC<sub>av</sub>) was measured for these tracts. Scores of Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) and Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT) were obtained. The median EDSS score was 2.5 (inter-quartile range 2-3.25). The ADC<sub>av</sub> in the pyramidal tracts (p = 0.02) and corpus callosum (p = 0.0004) in patients was significantly higher than in controls. Pyramidal tracts ADC<sub>av</sub> was correlated with pyramidal FSS (r = 0.5, p = 0.008). Corpus callosum ADC<sub>av</sub> was correlated with PASAT (r = - 0.58, p = 0.001). Global T<sub>2</sub> lesion volume did not correlate with the EDSS, but correlated with ADC<sub>av</sub> of the pyramidal tracts (r = 0.6, p = 0.0007) and corpus callosum (r = 0.8, p &lt; 0.0001). T<sub>2</sub> lesion volume within the pyramidal tracts and corpus callosum correlated with ADC<sub>av</sub> in the pyramidal tracts (r = 0.6, p = 0.0009) and corpus callosum (r = 0.65, p = 0.0002) respectively, but not with pyramidal FSS or PASAT score.

1286,2-s2.0-26244432101,Multicontrast MRI of remyelination in the central nervous system,"<p>Although magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) represents the most sensitive tool for the detection of white matter abnormalities in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS), the heterogeneity of NIS placques severely hampers the elucidation of specific pathophysiological processes. In order to identify putative MRI markers for de- and remyelination, we employed the cuprizone mouse model which leads to a selective and reversible demyelination of the corpus callosum with little or no axonal damage. Apart from histopathology, animals were studied with high-resolution three-dimensional MRI in vivo using multiple contrasts. While individual MRI findings significantly correlated with electron microscopy, the differentiation of regions with normal, demyelinated or remyelinated white matter by one contrast alone was less specific than by histology or electron microscopy. However, an accurate MRI prediction of the in vivo myelin status was achieved by a discriminant function analysis using a combination of T<sub>1</sub>, T<sub>2</sub> and magnetization transfer contrast. With a correct assignment of 95% of all animals examined, the procedure will allow for the survey of new therapeutic approaches aiming at improved remyelination.

1287,2-s2.0-33644803024,Diseases of white matter and schizophrenia-like psychosis,"<p>Objective: To analyse the available data regarding the presentation of psychosis in diseases of central nervous system (CNS) white matter. Method: The available neurological and psychiatric literature on developmental, neoplastic, infective, immunological and other white matter diseases was reviewed. Results: A number of diseases of the white matter can present as schizophrenia-like psychoses, including leukodystrophies, neoplasms, velocardiofacial syndrome, callosal anomalies and inflammatory diseases. Conclusions: Production of psychotic symptoms may result from functional asynchrony of interdependent regions, due to alterations in critical circuits as a result of pathology. The nature, location and timing of white matter pathology seem to be the key factors in the development of psychosis, especially during the critical adolescent period of association area myelination. Diseases that disrupt the normal formation of myelin appear to cause psychosis at higher rates than those that disrupt mature myelinated structures. Diffuse rather than discrete lesions, in particular those affecting frontotemporal zones, are also more strongly associated with schizophrenia-like psychosis. These illnesses point to the central role that white matter plays in maintaining CNS connectivity and to how pathology of the white matter may contribute to the neurobiology of psychosis. © 2005 Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists.</p>"

His left-handed writing was neologistic, whilst oral spelling, typing and spelling with the right hand were intact. Structural MRI scanning revealed a lesion of the body of the corpus callosum. Dichotic listening tests indicated that MCR displayed left hemisphere dominance for language. It is proposed that MCR represents a case of a disconnection syndrome in which right hemisphere systems that provide the basis for movement templates during left-handed writing are isolated from left hemisphere language systems. Analysis of left-handed writing indicated that peripheral movement control was highly structured with both individual letter frequency and sequential dependencies between letters represented within these motor control units. This case represents an opportunity to explore the mechanisms of movement control for writing and to examine the characteristics of isolated letter templates. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

I discuss the technical differences, as well as the diagnostic, therapeutic, and psychiatric uses of TMS/rTMS in this age group. Methods: I evaluated English-language studies from 1993 to August 2004 on nonconvulsive single-pulse, paired, and rTMS that supported a possible role for the use of TMS in persons younger than 18. Articles reviewed were retrieved from the MEDLINE database and Clinical Scientific index. Results: The 48 studies reviewed involved a total of 1034 children ages 2 weeks to 18 years; 35 of the studies used single-pulse TMS (980 children), 3 studies used paired TMS (20 children), and 7 studies used rTMS (34 children). Three studies used both single and rTMS. However, the number of subjects involved was not reported. Conclusions: Single-pulse TMS, paired TMS. and rTMS in persons younger than 18 has been used to examine the maturation/activity of the neurons of various central nervous system tracts, plasticity of neurons in epilepsy, other aspects of epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, myoclonus, transcallosal inhibition, and motor cortex functioning with no reported seizure risk. rTMS has been applied to psychiatric disorders such as ADHD, ADHD with Tourette's, and depression. Adult studies support an antidepressant effect from repetitive TMS, but there is only one study that has been reported on 7 patients that used rTMS to the left dorsal prefrontal cortex on children/adolescents with depression (5 of the 7 subjects treated responded). Although there are limited studies using rTMS (in 34 children), these studies did not report significant adverse effects or seizures. Repetitive TMS safety, ethical, and neurotoxicity concerns also are discussed. Copyright © 2005 by Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins.</p>"

Materials and Methods: A high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and optimized entire brain DTI data were acquired in 26 clinically-definite relapsing and remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) patients and 32 age-matched healthy adult controls. The fractional anisotropy (FA) values of seven functionally distinct regions in the normal-appearing CC were compared between patients and controls. Results: This study indicates that 1) there was a gender-independent FA heterogeneity of the functionally specialized CC segments in normal volunteers; 2) FA in the MS group was significantly decreased in the anterior (P = 0.0039) and posterior (P = 0.0018) midbody subdivisions of the CC, possibly due to a reduction of small-caliber axons; and 3) the FA of the genu of the CC was relatively intact in the MS patients compared to the healthy age-matched controls (P = 0.644), while the splenium showed an insignificant trend of reduced FA values (P = 0.248). The decrease in FA in any of the CC subdivisions did not correlate with disease duration (DD) or the expanded disability status scale (EDSS) score. Conclusion: The preliminary results are consistent with published histopathology and clinical studies on MS, but not with some published DTI reports. This study provides insights into the pathogenesis of MS, and the role played by compromised axonal integrity in this disease. © 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.</p>"
1295,2-s2.0-18044380678,Demyelination increases radial diffusivity in corpus callosum of mouse brain,"<p>Myelin damage, as seen in multiple sclerosis (MS) and other demyelinating diseases, impairs axonal conduction and can also be associated with axonal degeneration. Accurate assessments of these conditions may be highly beneficial in evaluating and selecting therapeutic strategies for patient management. Recently, an analytical approach examining diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) derived parameters has been proposed to assess the extent of axonal damage, demyelination, or both. The current study uses the well-characterized cuprizone model of experimental demyelination and remyelination of corpus callosum in mouse brain to evaluate the ability of DTI parameters to detect the progression of myelin degeneration and regeneration. Our results demonstrate that the extent of increased radial diffusivity reflects the severity of demyelination in corpus callosum of mouse brain affected by cuprizone treatment. Subsequently, radial diffusivity decreases with the progression of remyelination. Furthermore, radial diffusivity changes were specific to the time course of changes in myelin integrity as distinct from axonal injury, which was detected by βAPP immunostaining and shown to be most extensive prior to demyelination. Radial diffusivity offers a specific assessment of demyelination and remyelination, as distinct from acute axonal damage. © 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.</p>"

On both occasions, the magnetic resonance (MR) scan showed a giant demyelinating, peripherally enhancing lesion with mass effect. MR spectroscopy (MRS) was indistinguishable from a tumor. At the first episode, she had undergone tumor decompression but the histopathology revealed an acute demyelinating lesion with no evidence of tumor. Each time there was partial clinical recovery and resolution of the radiological lesion, the patient having received corticosteroids during both of the episodes. She also developed hemiballismus postoperatively which resolved on withdrawing phenytoin. It is suggested that a trial of corticosteroids be given in suspected tumefactive demyelinating lesions, although they may be indistinguishable from a tumor. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Methods: MRI findings of 41 samples of clinically definite MS, including the numbers, distributions, sizes, and shapes of the lesions were analyzed. The symbolic characteristics and enhanced expression are also covered. Results: Brain MS might happen singly and multiply, and more frequently with multiple happening. In a multiple case, 4-15 lesions were observed the most. Some samples showed with diffuse lesions which were unable to be counted accurately presenting as a ""dirty-appearing white matter"". The distribution of the lesions was observed most frequently at the two sides of periventricle, and following by the subcortical, corpus callosum, and brainstem. Only two lesions were observed at cerebrum. The size of most lesions range from a few millimeters to 2 cm, accounting for about 75% of the total samples. Lesions with size above 2 cm were seen seldomly, with the biggest one of 6-7 cm. According to the shapes and symptoms, lesions might be categorized as an acute and chronic ones. The acute lesions had a shape of oval or circle, with a swelling appearance, low signal of T<sub>1</sub>WI, and isointensity or a slightly higher signal on the circle. T<sub>2</sub>WI showed a high signal, with different increase and showing ""core + lunar"" sign. This kind of lesions showed an enhancement with the circle enhancement as the most typical one, which had a complete circle or non-conplete arc shape enhancement, even the big lesions. The chronic lesion might also be divided into two categories. One was the quasi-symmetric lesion, with the distribution along two sides of periventricle and with the shape of small puncture/patch, part of them merged into the big patch; another kind of lesions was found scattered sparsely at frontal, parietal lobes and two sides of the periventricle, with small patches in shape. The chronic lesions had an appearance of shrinking, sharp edge, even signals, and had no lunar circle phenomena and obvious enhancement. Conclusion: Brain MS have diverse MRI appearence, with some of which are unique and symbolic.</p>"

Moreover, the metallic cations have been associated with pathogenesis, particularly multiple sclerosis and malignant gliomas. The brain is vulnerable to either a deficit or an excess of available trace elements. Relationship between trace metals and myelinogenesis is important in understanding a severe human pathology : the multiple sclerosis, which remains without efficient treatment. One approach to understand this disease has used mutant or transgenic mice presenting myelin deficiency or excess. But to date, the concentration of trace metals and mineral elements in white and gray matter areas in wild type brain is unknown. The aim of this study is to establish the reference concentrations of trace metals (iron, copper and zinc) and minerals (potassium and calcium) in the white and gray matter of the mouse cerebellum and corpus callosum. The brains of four different genetic mouse strains (C57Black6/SJL, C57Black6/D2, SJL and C3H) were analyzed. The freeze-dried samples were prepared to allow PIXE (Proton-induced X-ray emission) and RBS (Rutherford backscattering spectrometry) analyses with the nuclear microprobe in Bordeaux.

1301,2-s2.0-29744448500,Applications of diffusion tensor MR imaging in multiple sclerosis,"<p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system that is the most common cause of nontraumatic disability in young adults in the United States. In recent years, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been established as an important paraclinical tool in MS for the assessment of clinical diagnosis, natural history, and treatment effects. In MS studies, there are many advantages to having a sensitive and reliable in vivo method for investigating the specific pathological changes of white matter and its integrity during the disease process. As a consequence, in the past decade, the application of MRI to the study of MS has been explored from conventional MRI to new advanced quantitative techniques with greater pathological specificity and sensitivity. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is one of the most promising techniques with regard to MS. It quantifies the amount of nonrandom water diffusion within tissues and provides unique in vivo information about the pathological processes that affect water diffusion as a result of brain microstructural damage. This review outlines the current state of the art and future direction of DTI and fiber tractography in the study of MS disease. © 2005 New York Academy of Sciences.</p>"
1302,2-s2.0-21444447035,Experimental demyelination caused by primary oligodendrocyte dystrophy. Regional distribution of the lesions in the nervous system of mice [correction],"<p>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Heterogeneity of multiple sclerosis lesions has been recently indicated: In addition to T-cell-mediated or T-cell plus antibody-mediated autoimmune mechanisms (patterns I-II) two other patterns (IIl-IV) were described. Patterns Ill-IV are characterized by primary oligodendrocyte dystrophy, reminiscent of virus- or toxin-induced demyelination rather than autoimmunity. It was described more than 30 years ago that dietary application of a copper-chelating agent called cuprizone results in primary oligodendrocyte degeneration which is followed by demyelination. The aim of the present study was to examine the regional distribution of cuprizone induced oligodendrocyte dystrophy and demyelination in the nervous system of mice. MATERIAL A METHODS: Demyelination was induced in male weanling Swiss-Webster mice by feeding them on a diet containing 0.6% (W/W) cuprizone bis(cyclohexanone)-oxalyldihydrazone (G. F. Smith Chemical, Columbus OH) for 8 weeks. Animals were sacrificed after 3, 7, 14, 27, 35, 56 days of cuprizone administration. Samples were taken from corpus callosum, anterior commissure, optic nerve, cervical spinal cord and sciatic nerve. Samples were examined by immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization for myelin proteins and myelin protein mRNA-s, respectively. Conventional neuropathological stainings and electron microscopy was also performed. RESULTS: Oligodendrocyte degeneration and demyelination followed a particular standard pattern in the central nervous system. Profound myelin loss developed in the superior cerebellar peduncle, anterior commissure and corpus callosum, whereas the optic nerves, velum medullare anterior and spinal cord showed little or no demyelination. Sciatic nerves were unaffected. No infiltration by lymphocytes or blood-brain barrier damage was observed during cuprizone treatment. CONCLUSION: Cuprizone induced oligodendrocyte damage and demyelination follows a particular standard pattern in the central nervous system of mice. Cuprizone induced demyelination might be considered as a model for human demyelinating disorders with primary oligodendrocyte dystrophy and apoptosis.</p>"
1303,2-s2.0-20444504600,Update on Susac's syndrome,"<p>Purpose of view: We review recent developments in the clinical course and imaging modalities for Susac's syndrome, a clinical triad consisting of encephalopathy, branch retinal artery occlusions and sensorineural hearing loss. Recent findings: Susac's syndrome has variable clinical presentations; recently described presentations include epileptic seizures and transient inverted vision. Advances in neuroradiology suggest that magnetic resonance imaging demonstrates distinctive patterns in the white and grey matter and in the leptomeninges. Reports have verified that Susac's syndrome is under-diagnosed because of its multisystem involvement and confusion with other imitating disorders (such as multiple sclerosis), and because of the fact that neuroradiologists are not acquainted with this syndrome. Summary: The precise aetiology of Susac's syndrome is still unknown and many areas have not yet been explored. Magnetic resonance imaging is the neuroimaging study of choice. Findings include multiple small hyperintense foci on T2-weighted images and contrast enhancement in white and grey matter of both supratentorial and infratentorial structures, corpus callosum and, occasionally, leptomeninges. Callosal lesions typically involve the central fibres and are probably pathognomonic for Susac's syndrome. When assessing patients with unexplained encephalopathy involving white and grey matter, leptomeninges and corpus callosum, the findings of sensorinueral hearing loss or visual disturbances may yield important clues regarding the possibility of Susac's syndrome. © 2005 Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins.</p>"

The consequences of axonal or demyelinating injuries on the axonal cytoskeleton have rarely been described. Methods. We have compared the density of fibers labeled by anti-neurofilaments (NF) and -β tubulin (TUB) to the density of total fibers in nine patients with axonal neuropathies of undetermined etiology (AUE), six with necrotizing angeitis with neuropathy (NAN), seven with chronic inflammatory demyelinating neuropathy (CIDP) and in five controls, as well as in six patients with chronic multiple sclerosis (MS). We also studied demyelinated rat corpus callosum after lysophosphatidyl (LPC) microinjection. Results. In AUE and NAN NF positive fibers decreased together with total fiber density, whereas TUB increased. In demyelinating lesions TUB was not altered (CIDP) or strongly decreased (MS, LPC); NF were strongly reduced in MS (where axon loss was prominent) and in LPC lesions (despite the lack of fiber degeneration) and for fiber densities &lt; 3900/mm<sup>2</sup> in CIDP.

1305,2-s2.0-11144324980,"Astroglial-derived lymphotoxin-α exacerbates inflammation and demyelination, but not remyelination","<p>Tumor necrosis factorα (TNFα) and lymphotoxin-α (Ltα) are upregulated in and around multiple sclerosis plaques and are proposed to play a role during chronic inflammation in demyelinating disease. Despite the perceived detrimental role of these cytokines, human clinical trials inhibiting TNFα signaling has led to worsening of symptoms in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. Our laboratory has verified a role for TNFα in the exacerbation of demyelination but, more importantly, has demonstrated a novel role for TNFα in reparative remyelination in a cuprizone-induced demyelination model. This may explain the worsening of symptoms experienced by MS patients. In view of the cross-talk in TNF family signaling, the aim of this study is to understand the role of Ltα in demyelination and remyelination in hopes of improving therapeutic strategies for MS. Using the same model, we show that mice lacking Ltα exhibit a delay in demyelination that is greater than that exhibited by TNFα null mice. In this model, Ltα is expressed primarily by astroglia. The delay in demyelination is accompanied by a delay in the loss of mature GSTπ-positive oligodendrocytes in Ltα<sup>-/-</sup> mice compared with wild-type mice. Ltα <sup>-/-</sup> mice have decreased numbers of microglia at the site of insult during demyelination, although the number of astrocytes present is similar between strains. In contrast to TNFα the lack of Ltα did not alter the time course of remyelination, or the number of mature oligodendrocytes during the remyelination phase. Since Ltα is detrimental in inflammation and demyelination, but not necessary for remyelination and repair, inhibiting Ltα signaling may represent a promising strategy to treat MS. © 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.</p>"

1307,2-s2.0-12344298305,Cognitive impairment in multiple sclerosis patients,"<p>In addition to neurological symptoms, multiple sclerosis is characterized by cognitive function impairment. Disturbances of memory, recall, information processing, visual-spacial perception, attention, and executive function, in less extent of speech, are present in about 60% of patients. They are similar to disorders in other subcortical dementias. Once they appear, they rarely recede. Conventional, and especially nonconventional magnetic resonance imaging evaluates more precisely the tissue substrate - diffuse neuroaxonal lesion of the entire brain parenchyma - than clinical findings, already in the early stage of the disease. Alterations in the brain imaging are manifested by T2 hyperintensive and T1 hypointensive lesions, decreased neuronal marker N-acetyl-aspartate in magnetic spectroscopy, decreased magnetization transfer ratio, and increased diffusivity with reduced anisotropy in diffusion-weighted imaging. Total volume of brain lesion, corpus callosum diameter, and relation of measures of brain chambers and the rest of the brain, are best indices of cognitive dysfunction in multiple sclerosis. Their diagnosis in the very beginning of the disease allows early application of therapeutic procedures. Symptomatic treatment of these disorders is not efficient, and immunomodulation, particularly the use of biologic versions of interferon-beta, shows disputable effects.

1308,2-s2.0-10044250173,Congenital adrenal hyperplasia and multiple sclerosis: Is there an increased risk of multiple sclerosis in individuals with congenital adrenal hyperplasia?,"<p>Background: Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is an inherited recessive disorder of adrenal steroidogenesis, generally caused by a total or partial deficiency in 21-hydroxylase, due to a deletion of or mutations in the CYP21 gene (the gene that codes for 21-hydroxylase). Impaired cortisol biosynthesis results in corticotropin hypersecution, which leads to overproduction of intermediate metabolites and androgens. Objective: To describe for the first time, to our knowledge, a patient with CAH and multiple sclerosis (MS). Design: Case report. Patient: A 22-year-old woman, diagnosed at birth as having a salt-losing 21-hydroxylase deficiency, had sudden visual loss in the right eye and pyramidal, sensory, and cerebellar signs. Repeated brain magnetic resonance images showed focal white matter lesions in periventricular areas, the corpus callosum, the cerebellum, and the brainstem. A cerebrospinal fluid examination revealed several oligoclonal bands. Thereafter, she had 2 relapses, characterized by ataxia and diplopia, and recovered after corticosteroid treatment. Results: The reported case fulfills the diagnostic criteria for CAH and MS. Conclusions: Some clues suggest that the association between CAH and MS could be nonincidental: a possible MS susceptibility locus is on chromosome 6p21, on which the CYP21 gene is located; the CYP21 gene and the CYP21P pseudogene alternate in tandem with the C4 genes (the genes that code for the homonym complement protein) (C4AQ0 is particularly frequent in patients with relapsing-remitting MS); and, in previous studies, brain magnetic resonance imaging showed T2-hyperintense focal areas in the white matter of CAH patients. Our observation should alert neurologists to the presence of signs and symptoms suggestive of late-onset CAH in MS patients and, in turn, endocrinologists to the appearance of neurological signs and symptoms in CAH patients.</p>"

Materials and Methods: Three healthy Dark Agouti (DA) rats and 16 DA rats with clinical signs of EAE were examined on a 3T whole body-system using a normal wrist coil. In total, 25 examinations were preformed using T2- and T1-weigthed images in transverse and sagittal orientation with a slice thickness of 2 mm or 1 mm (voxel size up to 0.2 × 0.2 × 1 mm). Sedation was achieved by intraperitoneal injection of ketamine and xylazine. In addition, T1-weighted images were obtained after the instillation of 1.0 ml of gadolinium diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (Gd-DTPA) (0.5 mmol/ml) into the peritoneal cavity. Results: T2- and T1-weighted images of the brain and spinal cord with high spatial and contrast resolution could be obtained in all animals. The anatomical details of the olfactory bulb glomeruli, cerebellum foliae, ventricles and corpus callosum were clearly visible. The EAE lesions presented as hyperintense areas in T2-weighted images and could be demonstrated in all clinically affected animals by MRI and histologically verified. In total, the 16 affected rats had 28 cerebral and 2 spinal cord lesions (range 1 to 4, median 2). Contrast enhancement was noted in 12 animals and ranked as severe in ten and moderate in two cases. No adverse effects were noted due to sedation or intraperitoneal contrast injection. Conclusions: The intravital demonstration of cerebral and spinal cord EAE lesions in rats is possible on a 3T whole-body MR scanner using a normal wrist coil. Intraperitoneal injection of ketamine/xylazine and contrast agent is an easy, safe and effective procedure inrats.</p>"

Instead, we demonstrated the presence of p75<sup>NTR</sup> on a subgroup of NG2-positive oligodendroglial progenitors in a periventricular plaque in one MS sample. Notably, p75<sup>NTR</sup>-expressing cells were also detected within the subventricular zone (SVZ) of this brain, adjacent to the periventricular plaque. In animals with experimental demyelination we observed similar patterns of p75<sup>NTR</sup> expression, initially confined to precursor cells within the SVZ, followed at later stages in the disease course by its expression amongst a subset of oligodendroglial progenitors within the corpus callosum. These data suggest that a population of precursor cells within the SVZ can be induced to express p75<sup>NTR</sup> and to subsequently assume an oligodendroglial progenitor phenotype in response to demyelination in the adjacent white matter. © 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.</p>"

1313,2-s2.0-4344697166,Cross-relaxation imaging reveals detailed anatomy of white matter fiber tracts in the human brain,"<p>Cross-relaxation imaging is a new quantitative MRI modality, which allows mapping of fundamental parameters determining the magnetization transfer (MT) effect in tissues, cross-relaxation rate constant (k) and bound pool fraction (f). This study introduces a new time-efficient technique for cross-relaxation imaging, which obtains three-dimensional (3D) whole-brain k and f maps with scan time of &lt;30 min and isotropic spatial resolution of 1.4 mm. The technical principle of the method is based on four-point fit of a matrix model of pulsed MT to imaging data obtained with variable offset frequency saturation while using a complimentary R <sub>1</sub> (=1 / T <sub>1</sub>) map. Anatomical correlations of in vivo cross-relaxation parametric maps were evaluated in three healthy subjects. The f maps revealed correspondence of areas with highly elevated f = 12-15% to major fiber tracts such as corpus callosum, anterior commissure, optic radiations, and major brain fasciculi. The rest of white matter (WM) demonstrated lower f = 9-11%, resulting in clear visual contrast of fiber tracts. Even lower f = 6.5-8.5% were found in gray matter (GM) with the highest f = 8.5% in the anterior thalamus. Distribution of k was relatively uniform in WM and produced sharp contrast between GM and WM (k = 1.6 and 3.3 s <sup>-1</sup>, respectively). The most marked feature of k maps was their ability to visualize the corticospinal tract, which had elevated k = 3.4-3.8 s <sup>-1</sup> but appeared invisible on f maps. The observed patterns on f maps can be explained by variations in the density of myelinated fibers, while the trends of k may reflect regional differences in axonal organization. Cross-relaxation imaging can be used in various clinical studies focused on brain development and white matter diseases. © 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.</p>"
1314,2-s2.0-4344678921,Mechanisms of normal appearing corpus callosum injury related to pericallosal T1 lesions in multiple sclerosis using directional diffusion tensor and <sup>1</sup>H MRS imaging,"<p>Objectives: To investigate the extent of tissue damage in a region of normal appearing corpus callosum (NACC) for different forms of multiple sclerosis (MS) using diffusion tensor and proton magnetic resonance (MR) spectroscopic imaging. Methods: A total of 47 patients with MS and 15 controls were included. Regions of interest from the NACC were manually segmented using high resolution anatomical images. Diffusion tensor eigenvalues and metabolite ratio of N-acetyl-aspartate (NAA) to creatine/phosphocreatine (Cr) were calculated in the NACC region. Results: Increased apparent diffusion coefficients (ADCs) and decreased anisotropy were observed in the NACC for patients with MS relative to the control subjects. These resulted from increased diffusion tensor eigenvalues perpendicular to the maximum diffusion direction. The NAA:Cr ratio was decreased in the NACC for patients with MS relative to the control subjects. Significant correlations between pericallosal T1 lesion load and MR modalities in the NACC were observed for patients with relapsing remitting/ secondary progressive MS (RR/SPMS), but not for patients with primary progressive MS (PPMS). Conclusion: This study provides further insight into changes in the ADC and diffusion anisotropy based on the diffusion tensor eigenvalues for patients with MS. The changes in the diffusion tensor eigenvalues and NAA:Cr ratio in the NACC for patients with RR/SPMS suggest axonal injury and/or dysfunction induced by wallerian degeneration. The lack of correlation between these variables in the NACC and focal MS lesions for patients with PPMS further supports intrinsic differences related to tissue injury between these subtypes of MS.</p>"
1315,2-s2.0-4344625746,"Notch1 and jagged1 are expressed after CNS demyelination, but are not a major rate-determining factor during remyelination","<p>The reasons for the eventual failure of repair mechanisms in multiple sclerosis are unknown. The presence of precursor and immature oligodendrocytes in some non-repairing lesions suggests a mechanism in which these cells either receive insufficient differentiation signals or are exposed to differentiation inhibitors. Jagged signalling via Notch receptors on oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) inhibits their differentiation during development and the finding that both notch and jagged are expressed in multiple sclerosis lesions has fostered the view that this signalling pathway may explain remyelination failure. In this study, we show that Notch1 is expressed on adult OPCs and that there are multiple cellular sources of its ligand Jagged1 in a rodent model of remyelination. However, despite their expression, the lesions undergo complete remyelination. To establish whether Notch-jagged signalling regulates the rate of remyelination we compared their expression profiles in young animals with those in older animals, where remyelination occurs more slowly, but could find no correlation between expression and remyelination rate. Finally we found that OPC-targeted Notch1 ablation in cuprizone-treated Plp-creER Notch1 <sup>LOX/LOX</sup> transgenic mice yielded no significant differences in remyelination parameters between knock-out and control mice. Thus, in contrast to developmental myelination, adult expression of Notch1 and Jagged1 neither prevents nor plays a major rate-determining role in remyelination. More generally, the re-expression of developmentally expressed genes following injury in the adult does not per se imply similar function.</p>"

In this study we aimed to identify initial MRI factors that are predictive of a second attack and disability after a first episode of acute CNS inflammatory demyelination in childhood. A cohort of 116 children who had a first episode of acute CNS inflammatory demyelination between 1990 and 2002 was studied using survival analysis methods. The initial MRI data were reviewed in a systematic, standardized, double-blind manner. The average follow-up was 4.9 ± 3 years. Multivariate analysis showed that the rate of second attack was higher in patients with corpus callosum long axis perpendicular lesions (34 out of 116 patients, 30%) on the initial MRI [hazard ratio (HR) 2.89; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.65-5.06] and/or with the sole presence of well-defined lesions (46 out of 116 patients, 40%) (HR 1.71; 95% CI 1.29-2.27). Both criteria were more specific predictors (100%) of relapse, demonstrating conversion to multiple sclerosis, than the three Barkhof criteria (63%), but were less sensitive (21% compared with 52%). None of the MRI criteria was predictive of severe disability. Using initial MRI and survival analysis methods, we identified two specific predictors of relapse and conversion to multiple sclerosis after a first episode of acute CNS inflammatory demyelination in childhood. Their low sensitivity, however, shows that this prediction remains difficult.</p>"

1319,2-s2.0-4344690054,Multiple sclerosis pathology in the normal and abnormal appearing white matter of the corpus callosum by diffusion tensor imaging,"<p>Lesions in the corpus callosum in multiple sclerosis (MS) include those that are hyperintense on T2-weighted images, which can be either focal (isolated) or connected, but there is evidence that the corpus callosum, similar to other white matter regions, contains normal appearing white matter (NAWM) which is abnormal based on quantitative MR methodologies. In this pilot study, diffusion tensor based measures were determined in corpus callosum from 10 patients with MS and 12 age and gender matched controls. T2-hyperintense lesions were carefully segmented out from normal appearing corpus callosum to minimize contamination of the NAWM fraction with these lesions. The orientationally averaged diffusion coefficient was increased and the fractional anisotropy reduced in the NAWM fraction of the MS patients. These results confirm prior studies which suggest that pathology in the NAWM occurs independent of focal MS lesions, and are not likely the result of sample contamination through or across slices. This injury to the NAWM may be the result of focal, microscopic T2-invisible lesions and/or secondary degeneration related to distant lesions whose related fibres cross the corpus callosum. © Arnold 2004.</p>"

To review the most recent data regarding clinical applications of the dichotic listening technique in neurology and neuropsychiatry. Development The technique is described, in addition to the two main cognitive abilities we can measure with it. First, language lateralization, following Kimura's model as an anatomical explanation of the right ear advantage effect. Second, the attentional function, including Kinsbourne's model and the forced attention paradigm from Hugdahl as a valuable working tool to evaluate selective attention and executive functions. In subsequent sections, a review is offered respecting both types of cognitive processes for schizophrenia, depression, dyslexia and multiple sclerosis, along with data from our laboratory regarding the last illness. Conclusions. The dichotic listening is a useful technique to evaluate the integrity of the temporal and frontal lobes, as well as the interhemispheric communication across the corpus callosum. Application to the clinical practice pretends to incorporate it to the diagnostic, to the description of the pathologies profiles and also to the prediction of illness course, resulting promising in some cases although with reasonable limits while looking for additional research.</p>"
1321,2-s2.0-3142746904,Corpus callosum axonal injury in multiple sclerosis measured by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging,"<p>Background: Axonal damage has been observed in normal-appearing white matter (NAWM) for patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). Objectives: To investigate changes in brain metabolite ratios in a region of normal-appearing corpus callosum (CC) for patients with MS and to test its relationship to changes in other regions of NAWM. Design and Methods: Data were collected from 24 patients with MS and 15 control subjects. Two-dimensional proton magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging was performed centered at the CC. Regions of interest from normal-appearing CC were manually segmented using anatomical images. The NAWM outside the CC region was segmented based on the signal intensity in T1- and T2-weighted images. Results: The N-acetylaspartate- creatine-phosphocreatine ratio was lower in both regions for patients with secondary progressive MS compared with the controls; the N-acetylaspartate- creatine-phosphocreatine was lower only in the normal-appearing CC region for patients with relapsing-remitting MS (P&lt;.001) compared with the controls. The ratio of choline-containing compound compared with the creatine-phosphocreatine ratio was also lower in the region of normal-appearing CC for patients with relapsing-remitting MS (P = .003) compared with the controls. There was a correlation between the N-acetylaspartate-creatine-phosphocreatine ratio in the normal-appearing CC and T1 lesions (r = -0.53, P = .01) for all patients. Conclusions: The CC was a more sensitive location for depicting axonal injury than other regions of NAWM. A correlation between the reduction of the N-acetylaspartate-creatine-phosphocreatine ratio in the normal-appearing CC and the T1 lesions may suggest that transection of axons in lesions may cause distant axonal damage and/or dysfunction that are expressed and more sensitively detectable in the CC.</p>"

Materials and Methods: DTI was performed in 12 healthy volunteers and 15 patients who have relatively short disease duration (mean = 2.7 years). Both fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) were obtained in different regions of normal-appearing CC (NACC) and NAWM in frontal and occipital regions. Results: The data showed significantly lower FA (P &lt; 0.001) and higher MD (P &lt; 0.04) for NACC regions, but not for frontal and occipital NAWM regions, in patients than in those in healthy volunteers after Bonferroni adjustment. The increase of MD in the entire NACC regions was correlated with the total cerebral lesion volume (r = 0.75, P= 0.001) in patients. Conclusion. The water diffusion changes indicate that in the early phase of disease there is a preferential occult injury of CC, which is likely due to the Wallerian degeneration from distant lesions.</p>"

Results: The rate of the patients whose full intelligence quotient (FIQ) were less than 90 scores was 40% (28/70), which were higher than that of the normal group (P &lt; 0.01). Spearman analysis between IQ and MRI parameters showing bicaudate ratio (BCR) was the best parameters (P &lt; 0.01), then the corpus callosum brain ratio (CCR, P &lt; 0.05).

Methods: Thirty-three MS patients (24 relapsing remitting, 8 secondary progressive, 1 primary progressive) and 18 controls underwent MR examinations. T<sub>2</sub> relaxation data were acquired using a 32-echo measurement. All controls and 18 of the 33 MS patients were scanned in the transverse plane through the genu and splenium of the corpus callosum. Five white matter and 6 grey matter structures were outlined in each of these subjects. The remaining 15 MS patients were scanned in other transverse planes. A total of 189 lesions were outlined in the MS patients. Water content and myelin water fraction were calculated for all regions of interest and all lesions. Results: The normal appearing white matter (NAWM) water content was, on average, 2.2% greater than that from controls, with significant differences occurring in the posterior internal capsules, genu and splenium of the corpus callosum, minor forceps and major forceps (p &lt; 0.0006). On average, MS lesions had 6.3% higher water content than contralateral NAWM (p &lt; 0.0001). Myelin water fraction was 16% lower in NAWM than for controls, with significant differences in the major and minor forceps, internal capsules, and splenium (p &lt; 0.05). The myelin water fraction of MS lesions averaged 52% that of NAWM. Conclusions: NAWM in MS has a higher water content and lower myelin water fraction than control white matter. The cause of the myelin water fraction decrease in NAWM could potentially be due to either diffuse edema, inflammation, demyelination or any combination of these features. We present a simple model which suggests that myelin loss is the dominant feature of NAWM pathology.</p>"

1330,2-s2.0-3042641620,"Imaging primary progressive multiple sclerosis: The contribution of structural, metabolic, and functional MRI techniques","<p>Patients with primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS) typically experience a progressive disease course from onset, leading to the accumulation of severe neurological disability. This is in contrast with the observation that the burden and activity of lesions on conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of the brain are much lower in patients with PPMS than in those with other less disabling forms of the disease. Studies with structural and functional MRI techniques are providing relevant contributions to the understanding of the mechanisms underlying the accumulation of irreversible neurological deficits in patients with PPMS. The results of these studies underpin that the main factors possibly explaining the clinical/MRI discrepancy observed in patients with PPMS include the presence of a diffuse tissue damage that is beyond the resolution of conventional imaging, the extent of cervical cord damage, and the impairment of the adaptive capacity of the cortex to limit the functional consequences of subcortical pathology. © Arnold 2004.</p>"

METHODS: Forty-one patients with brain MS, 17 males and 24 females, aged 13 approximately 65, and 21 healthy people, 8 males and 13 females, aged 18 approximately 57, used as controls underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using 3D-spoiled grass (3D-SPGR) series, to scan the whole brain with saturated pulses on and off respectively. The signal values were measured directly in the pictures of these 2 series. The formula MTR = (M(0)-MS)/M(0) x 100% was used, where M0 represents the signal value of region of interest with the saturated pulses off, and Ms represents signal value of region of interest with the saturated pulses on, to calculate the MTR value. With reference to T(2)WI imaging, the MTR values of 17 regions of interest (ROI) in the normal-appearing brain white matter, including the white matter of pons, bilateral cerebellar peduncles, knees of internal capsules, splenium and genu of corpus callosum, and the white matter by the anterior horn and posterior horn of lateral ventricle, body of lateral ventricle, and deep in the frontal and parietal lobes, were measured. The average MTR value of the 17 ROI was used to represent the MTR value of the whole normal-appearing brain and used to make comparison with that of the healthy samples statistically. RESULTS: Compared with those of the healthy samples, the average MTR values of each ROI of the MS patients were lower at different degrees. The difference in the MTR values of the white matter of splenium of corpus callosum, and by lateral ventricle and deep in parietal lobe were especially bigger. The MTR value of the whole brain white matter in the healthy persons ranged from 22.76% to 25.42%, with an average value of 23.97%, both significantly higher than those of the MS patients (19.45% to 24.15%, and 22.44% respectively, both P &lt; 0.05).

Atrophy increases with the progression of the disease. Nevertheless, no data concerning the onset of atrophy of CC are currently available. The purpose of this study is to determine if damage in callosal tissue was present at the earliest stage of MS, in a subgroup of patients presenting with a clinically isolated syndrome suggestive of MS (CISSMS), fulfilling the dissemination in space criteria according to McDonald. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) techniques were applied to measure CC volume, magnetization transfer ratio (MTR), mean diffusivity (MD), N-acetyl aspartate/choline-containing compounds (NAA/Cho) ratio, N-acetyl aspartate/total creatine (NAA/Cr) ratio and Cho/Cr ratio inside the CC of 46 CISSMS patients and 24 sex- and age-matched controls. No atrophy of CC was observed in the CISSMS group. CC of patients was characterized by decreased MTR and increased MD. No change in the NAA/Cr ratio was observed while the NAA/Cho ratio decreased and Cho/Cr ratio increased in the splenium and the central anterior part of CC. These abnormalities were present in patients with, but also without, macroscopic lesions inside the CC. Our results indicate that diffuse structural and metabolic changes, which may be interpreted as representing predominantly myelin pathology, occur in the CC at the earliest stage of MS before any atrophy is detected.</p>"
1335,2-s2.0-0141730434,Directional diffusion in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis: A possible in vivo signature of Wallerian degeneration,"<p>Purpose: To examine the role of directional dependence of the apparent diffusion coefficients in the evaluation of normal-appearing brain regions of patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. Materials and Methods: The role of diffusion tensor eigenvalues was investigated in the normal-appearing brain regions for 18 patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis and 15 age-matched normal controls. Results: The isotropic apparent diffusion was increased in all regions. However, reduced anisotropy was significant only in regions with high anisotropy, including the corpus callosum and the internal capsule, and was due to increased diffusion tensor eigenvalues corresponding to diffusion transverse to the fibers without significant increase along the fibers. This characteristic pattern of changes in diffusion tensor eigenvalues has been observed previously in cases of Wallerian degeneration. Low-anisotropy regions corresponded to gray matter and gray/white interface regions. Since fiber tract orientations are not determined for regions of low anisotropy, this characteristic pattern of diffusion change is not detectable in these regions. Conclusion: Examination of diffusion tensor eigenvectors may provide insight into the changes observed in diffusion and a signature of Wallerian degeneration in the normal-appearing white matter of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis patients. © 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.</p>"

A 40-year-old man presented with subacute left hemiplegia and ataxia. Cranial MRI revealed disseminated patchy white matter changes involving the corpus callosum, basal ganglia and brainstem. CSF investigation demonstrated elevated total protein but was otherwise normal. Mutation analysis of the GFAP gene was performed in the patient, his mother and healthy brother. A novel heterozygous mutation in exon 4, 681G→C, predicting an amino acid substitution E223Q in the rod region of GFAP was detected in the patient and his mother but not in his healthy brother or 150 control chromosomes. We conclude that the patient is actually afflicted with Alexander disease. Mutation analysis of GFAP should be considered in patients with remitting neurological deficits, disseminated white matter lesions and absence of inflammatory CSF changes. Copyright © 2003 S.

1337,2-s2.0-0043014851,"Iron, transferrin and myelinogenesis","<p>Transferrin (Tf), the iron binding protein of vertebrates serum, is known to be synthesized by oligodendrocytes (Ols) in the central nervous system. It has been postulated that Tf is involved in Ols maturation and myelinogenesis. This link is particularly important in the understanding of a severe human pathology: the multiple sclerosis, which remains without efficient treatment. We generated transgenic mice containing the complete human Tf gene and extensive regulatory sequences from the 5<sup>′</sup> and 3 <sup>′</sup> untranslated regions that specifically overexpress Tf in Ols. Brain cytoarchitecture of the transgenic mice appears to be normal in all brain regions examined, total myelin content is increased by 30% and motor coordination is significantly improved when compared with non-transgenic littermates. Tf role in the central nervous system may be related to its affinity for metallic cations. Normal and transgenic mice were used for determination of trace metals (iron, copper and zinc) and minerals (potassium and calcium) concentration in cerebellum and corpus callosum. The freeze-dried samples were prepared to allow proton-induced X-ray emission and Rutherford backscattering spectrometry analyses with the nuclear microprobe in Bordeaux. Preliminary results were obtained and carbon distribution was revealed as a very good analysis to distinguish precisely the white matter region.

The characteristic imaging features included an oval high signal lesion on T2-weighted images in the central part of the splenium, no enhancement on post-contrast MR images, and complete reversibility without specific treatment. We report identical MR imaging findings in a depressive patient who had received antiepileptic drugs. In addition, diffusion-weighted MR imaging findings are described in our case, which is the first report on this unique lesion associated with antiepileptic drugs. Although this lesion has been assumed to be vasogenic edema in the previous reports, diffusion-weighted MR imaging showed markedly restricted diffusion of the lesion in the present case, suggesting that cytotoxic edema was the main pathophysiological abnormality.</p>"
1339,2-s2.0-0038141327,MRI lesion volume heterogeneity in primary progressive MS in relation with axonal damage and brain atrophy,"<p>Objectives: To investigate whether axonal damage in primary progressive (PP) multiple sclerosis (MS), as measured by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (HMRS) imaging and brain atrophy, is a function of T2 weighted brain lesion volume. Methods: 34 PP MS patients were divided into two categories: low (&lt;3 cm<sup>3</sup>, n = 18) or high (≥3 cm<sup>3</sup>, n = 16) T2 lesion load (LL). An Index of Brain Atrophy (IBA) was calculated and HMRS metabolite ratios were derived from a central brain area centred at the corpus callosum. Results: Patient groups did not differ with regard to clinical characteristics and showed lower mean IBA and mean N-acetylaspartate:creatinine (NAA:Cr) ratios compared to healthy controls. Conclusion: PP patients with low and high brain T2LL have detectable brain atrophy and NAA:Cr reduction compared to healthy controls. In PP MS, T2 lesions alone are insufficient to explain the presence of brain atrophy and decrease in NAA:Cr.</p>"
1340,2-s2.0-0037925129,Diffusely elevated cerebral choline and creatine in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis,"<p>It is well known that multiple sclerosis (MS) pathogenesis continues even during periods of clinical silence. To quantify the metabolic characteristics of this activity we compared the absolute levels of N-acetylaspartate (NAA), creatine (Cr), and choline (Cho) in the normal-appearing white matter (NAWM) between relapsing-remitting (RR) MS patients and controls. Metabolite concentrations were obtained with 3D proton MR spectroscopy at 1.5 T in a 480 cm<sup>3</sup> volume-of-interest (VOI), centered on the corpus callosum of 11 MS patients and 9 matched controls. Gray/white-matter/cerebral-spinal-fluid (CSF) volumes were obtained from MRI segmentation. Patients' average VOI tissue volume (V<sub>T</sub>), 410.8 ± 24.0 cm<sup>3</sup>, and metabolite levels, NAA = 6.33 ± 0.70, Cr = 4.67 ± 0.52, Cho = 1.40 ± 0.17 mM, were different from the controls by -8%, -9%, +22% and +32%. The Cho level was the only single metric differentiating patients from controls at 100% specificity and &gt;90% sensitivity. Diffusely elevated Cho and Cr probably reflect widespread microscopic inflammation, gliosis, or de- and remyelination in the NAWM. Both metabolites are potential prognostic indicators of current disease activity, preceding NAA decline and atrophy. © 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.</p>"
1341,2-s2.0-0042860091,Mood and emotion in multiple sclerosis,"<p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the commonest non traumatic neurological disease of young adults and disorders of mood and emotional expression can be seen during MS. The classical psychopathological description of MS usually distinguishes three types of phenomena: euphoria, paroxysmal laughing and crying, and depression. These phenomena belong to different levels of description and cover almost all the disorders. From a practical point of view, it is useful to distinguish, on the one hand, the thymic disorders related to permanent alterations in mood, such as depressive or anxiety syndromes and euphoria, and on the other hand, the emotional disorders encompassing the transitory affective reactions, such as paroxysmal laughing and crying, lability and emotional incontinence. This distinction emanates from the conceptual approach to emotion, mood and affect that we review here. Recently, alexithymic functioning has been reported in 50% of patients with MS. It is more frequent than in the general population (9%) and is characterized by the absence of awareness of sentiments and affect, and by a difficulty in verbalizing emotional experiences. There is a significant correlation between the degree of alexithymia and atrophy of the posterior part of the corpus callosum on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which supports the notion of interhemispheric cerebral dysfunction in MS. After reviewing the thymic and emotional disorders, we present a study on the relationship between emotion and cognition in 40 patients with MS, with less than 5 years of disease progression. A control group consisted of 40 healthy subjects, matched for age, sex and level of education. The main findings confirm the early onset of emotional and cognitive disorders in MS, as well as their high frequency. The psychological functioning of our patients in this study was different from that of the healthy subjects from the general population. The main features were: anxiety, alexithymia, difficulty in comprehension of emotions, poor memory and verbal fluidity. In conclusion, it is important to highlight the need for initiating early on, and in a systematic manner, therapy for the studied disorders. They represent a handicap, which often goes unrecognized, with consequences on the daily lives of patients and their families leading to difficulties in relational and social adaptation.</p>"

Forty-three cases (0.63%) were found in which the final histopathological diagnosis excluded a neoplastic, infectious or inflammatory lesion but disclosed a cerebral insult. Histologically these could be subdivided into ischemic insults in 38 cases (88%) and hemorrhagic insults in five cases (12%). On the basis of clinical and radiological findings in this group, 35 patients (81%) were sent to our department because of suspected neoplasmatic lesions, two patients (5%) because of multiple sclerosis, two patients (5%) because of inflammatory disease and one patient (2%) because of a suspected infectious parasitic disease. All patients underwent initial CT examinations which showed hypodense lesions of the brain in 38 patients (88%) and hyperdense lesions in five cases (12%). Constant enhancement on CT scans of the mass lesion was found in 12 patients (28%) only. Fourteen lesions (33%) were located in the right hemisphere, five lesions (12%) in the left hemisphere, nine lesions (21%) in the basal ganglia, four lesions (9%) in the midbrain, two lesions (4.5%) in the corpus callosum and one lesion (2%) in a thalamus. Multiple lesions were present in eight cases (19%). The most common initial neurological symptoms upon clinical presentation were hemiparesis (18 patients, 42%), epilepsy (eight patients, 18%), a change in mental status (six patients, 14%). There was no mortality and no operative morbidity associated with the stereotactic biopsy in this group of patients. The most common neurological disorder, cerebrovascular insult, rarely poses diagnostic problems. If there are doubts a serial stereotactic biopsy can safely clarify the situation.</p>"

In multiple sclerosis (MS) Wallerian degeneration of axons traversing focal lesions is a potential mechanism of damage in normal-appearing white matter. In viva evidence for this hypothesis is limited. The present study investigated the relationship between DTI-derived indices in the normal-appearing corpus callosum (CC) and the lesion loads (LLs) in connected cerebral regions. DTI was performed in 39 MS patients and in 21 age-matched controls. Fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) were estimated in the genu, body and splenium of CC. Patients showed lower FA and higher MD in the CC than controls and both correlated with the total LL (r = -0.56 and r = 0.54, p &lt; 0.0001). The LL of individual cerebral lobes correlated with both FA and MD in the corresponding callosal regions, with the body showing the strongest correlations with frontal and parietal LL (p &lt; 0.0001). The strong correlations between DTI indices in the CC and the extent of lesions in connected brain regions support the hypothesis that Wallerian degeneration of axons transected by remote, but connected focal lesions, is an important pathogenic mechanism of damage in MS.</p>"
1344,2-s2.0-0642341204,The relation between brain MRI lesions and depressive symptoms in multiple sclerosis.,"<p>The authors investigated the relationship between depression and involvement of specific brain areas in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. 20 MS patients (10 depressed and 10 non-depressed) were evaluated. The emotional state was assessed by several neuropsychological tests, and all of the patients underwent 1.5 Tesla magnetic resonance (MRI) including T1 and T2 weighted images. MRI data were analyzed by measuring the regional area of lesions (in mm2) in the frontal, temporal and corpus callosum locations, side and the number of lesions. The correlation of MRI findings between depressed and non-depressed groups of patients has shown that a statistically significant difference was achieved between regional frontal lesions area (p = 0.02), aa well as significant difference between regional temporal area of lesions (p = 0.13). In the depressed group of patients a greater lesions area was achieved in the right when compared with the left frontal lobe. No differences were obtained for the temporal lobe. The highest number of lesions were observed in the right frontal lobe in the depressed group of patients. Our findings have shown that depressive symptoms are associated with the area and location of brain lesions. (Tab. 1, Fig. 2, Ref. 8.)</p>"
1345,2-s2.0-0642305977,Psychics and neuropsychologics troubles in multiple sclerosis,"<p>Neuropsychological investigations have demonstrated that cognitive disorders are common (about 60 %) inpatients with multiple sclerosis. 22 patients and 22 controls participated in the study with a review of literature. The cognitive dysfunction may be termed a subcortical white matter dementia. The hallmarks are: forgetfulness, reduced speed of information processing, impaired attention and slowness of thought processes, impaired ability to manipulate acquired knowledge. Psychiatric disturbance have also high prevalence: emotional or personality changes, depression. Pathological laughing and crying are classical but not well understood. This intellectual and emotional changes in multiple sclerosis are studied by adapted psychometric psychiatric examination. Correlation of magnetic resonance imaging with neuropsychological testing is now demonstrated. Total lesion score is the best predictor of cognitive deficits, cerebral atrophy and lesions of the corpus callosum also. Neuropsychological rehabilitation techniques and symptomatic treatments must be applied to patients with multiple sclerosis.</p>"
1346,2-s2.0-0242558184,Multiple sclerosis vs acute disseminated encephalomyelitis in childhood,"<p>The initial presenting clinical and laboratory findings of either acute disseminated encephalomyelitis or the first attack of multiple sclerosis in the pediatric population were compared and contrasted. A retrospective review of the medical records was conducted of all children younger than 17 years who presented with either the diagnosis of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis or multiple sclerosis between 1987 and 2001. Seventeen cases of clinically definite multiple sclerosis (seven female, mean age 12.4 ± 4.5 years) and seven cases of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (three female; mean age 8.7 ± 3.8 years) were reviewed. Systemic and nonfocal neurologic symptoms were more commonly evident in acute disseminated encephalomyelitis than in multiple sclerosis: fever (43% vs 6%), headache (57% vs 24%), fatigue (71% vs 29%), vomiting (57% vs 0%), and encephalopathy (71% vs 6%). In multiple sclerosis patients, T<sub>2</sub>-weighted white matter magnetic resonance imaging lesions were more commonly located in the corpus callosum (64% vs 17%) and the periventricular area (91% vs 50%) compared with those in patients with acute disseminated encephalomyelitis. These results suggest that acute disseminated encephalomyelitis and multiple sclerosis can be differentiated to some degree according to clinical and radiologic data at initial presentation, which is important because the long-term prognosis for childhood multiple sclerosis appears to be less favorable. © 2003 by Elsevier Inc.

1347,2-s2.0-0037377273,Semliki Forest virus-induced demyelination and remyelination - Involvement of B cells and anti-myelin antibodies,"<p>Semliki Forest virus (SFV) infection induces a demyelinating encephalomyelitis in the central nervous system (CNS) of mice and serves as a model for multiple sclerosis (MS). This study investigated CNS immune responses at different stages of infection and during SFV-induced demyelination and remyelination. Following the initial CNS inflammation, pathology and viral clearance on days 6-10 post-infection (pi), primary demyelination was observed in cerebellar, brainstem and corpus collosal white matter by days 15-21 pi, with plasma cells and microglia as main participants, and this was followed by remyelination. By day 35 pi, the tissue appeared almost normal. Fluorescent antibody cell sorter (FACS) analysis showed that brain CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells increased during the initial inflammatory response and gradually decreased thereafter. Brain B cell (B220<sup>+</sup>CD19<sup>+</sup>) numbers did not change significantly during the course of infection; however, from days 14 to 35 pi, they matured and produced antibodies to viral and myelin proteins (and peptides) during the period of demyelination and remyelination. The proportion of CD3<sup>-</sup>B220<sup>-</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup> cells also progressively increased throughout the periods of de- and remyelination. Our results suggest that CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells are involved in the initial destruction of CNS tissue during the first weeks of SFV infection, while B cells, antibodies and microglia may contribute to the myelin pathology seen after recovery. © 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

1348,2-s2.0-0036971447,Ferritin binding in the developing mouse brain follows a pattern similar to myelination and is unaffected by the jimpy mutation,"<p>We have previously provided evidence that ferritin binds selectively to white matter tracts in adult mouse and human brains. In cell culture experiments, ferritin binding is specifically localized to oligodendrocytes. The goal of the present study is to test the hypothesis that the developmental pattern for ferritin binding will coincide with the onset and progression of myelination. The first evidence of ferritin binding in the mouse brain is at 12 days of age and occurs within the brainstem. Ferritin binding persisted in the brainstem and expanded to the corpus callosum by 15-16 days of age. By 23-24 days of age ferritin binding had further extended to the striatal white matter. By adulthood, ferritin binding was strongly and selectively expressed throughout all white matter tracts. To begin to identify which factors may be involved in the induction of ferritin-binding proteins on oligodendrocytes, brains from the myelin mutant jimpy mice and unaffected littermates were examined at postnatal days 16-18. Jimpy mice were chosen because their oligodendrocytes fail to produce myelin or accumulate iron. Thus, using jimpy mice would elucidate whether these factors are necessary for ferritin-binding protein expression. Both the jimpy mutants and their controls exhibited saturable ferritin binding with similar binding densities and dissociation constants. Dissociation constants for ferritin binding in the unaffected littermates and jimpy mutant mice were 0.38 ± 0.04 and 0.32 ± 0.06 nM, respectively and binding densities were similar (1.1 ± 0.09 and 0.96 ± 0.12 fmol/mg, respectively). Our results demonstrate that expression of ferritin binding is dependent on the age of the oligodendrocytes and not dependent upon iron accumulation by oligodendrocytes or myelin production. We propose that iron delivery to oligodendrocytes is predominantly via ferritin and this method of iron uptake is unique to oligodendrocytes in the brain. Copyright © 2002 S. Karger AG, Basel.</p>"
1349,2-s2.0-0036933634,Hyperhidrosis probably due to hypothalamic involvement in multiple sclerosis: A case report,"<p>We report a 37-year-old female patient presented initially with typical radiological and clinical manifestations of multiple sclerosis (MS). She was found to have blurred vision and paresthesia. Later, she suffered from lower limbs weakness, general fatigue, difficulty swallowing, intentional tremor and urinary retention. At the same period, the patient was also found to have hyperhidrosis, which was not a typical sign of MS. After MR imaging revealed that there was a high signal lesion on T2WI at right hypothalamus which eventually involved the contralateral side of hypothalamus, the previous diagnosis became controversial. MS is a progressive demyelination disease, the most frequent affected sites in brain are periventricular white matter, corpus callosum or centrum semiovale. It was thought MS plaque was rarely found in hypothalamus. By reviewing articles in English literature, we found similar cases of multiple sclerosis involving hypothalamus and one of them was presented as hyperhidrosis.</p>"

1351,2-s2.0-0036407449,Choline is increased in pre-lesional normal appearing white matter in multiple sclerosis,"<p>Objective: Our aim was to determine if the resonance intensity of choline-containing compounds (Cho) measured using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) was increased in pre-lesional normal appearing white matter (NAWM) in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) relative to NAWM that remained stable in subsequent scans. Background: The Cho peak in MR spectra is associated with membrane phospholipids and increases in acute MS plaques, possibly even before the appearance of MRI-visible MS lesions. Methods: Three combined proton MRI and MRS imaging examinations of the corpus callosum and adjacent periventricular white matter were performed on 12 MS patients at intervals of 6 months. Proton density (PD) images were visually matched across 3 time points and the lesion volume in each voxel of the volume of interest was determined. The voxels were subdivided into four groups based on the presence or absence of lesion at baseline and change or no change in lesion volume on the subsequent scan. Results: We found a significantly higher baseline Cho/Creatine (Cr) ratio in NAWM voxels that displayed MRI visible lesions 6 months later than NAWM voxels that remained unchanged (1.57 ± 0.30 and 1.37 ± 0.33, respectively, p &lt; 0.001). The 12-month interval data revealed similar pre-lesional elevated Cho/Cr, (1.51 ± 0.29 versus 1.39 ± 0.32, p = 0.009). Voxels that contained lesion at baseline and increased in lesion volume at 6 months also showed a significantly higher Cho/Cr ratio than those whose lesion volume did not change (1.60 ± 0.32 and 1.49 ± 0.36, respectively, p = 0.043). Conclusions: The results of this study are consistent with focal pre-lesional myelin membrane pathology in the NAWM at least 12 months before lesions become visible on conventional MRI. This could reflect altered myelin chemistry or the presence of inflammation as seen in experimental allergic encephalomyelitis.</p>"

Methods: Focal TMS of the motor cortex was performed in 118 patients with MS (96 with relapsing-remitting, 19 with primary progressive, and three with secondary progressive disease) who had an Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score between 0 and 6.5 and in 35 normal subjects. Central motor latencies (CML) and TI (onset latency, duration) were investigated. The Spearman rank correlation was used for statistical analysis. Results: TMS disclosed prolonged CML in 52.5% and abnormal TI in 61% of the patients. In all patients the EDSS correlated with the frequency of abnormal TI (r = 0.58, p &lt; 0.01) and abnormal CML (r = 0.51, p &lt; 0.01). In patients with primary progressive MS (EDSS 1.5 to 6.5) the frequency of TI abnormalities correlated with EDSS (r = 0.65, p &lt; 0.01) whereas CML did not. Delayed corticospinal responses in hand muscles always led to abnormal TI. Conclusions: The combination of central motor latencies and transcallosal inhibition evoked by transcranial magnetic stimulation yields objective data to estimate disease progression in MS as assessed by the EDSS.</p>"

Methods: 48 MS patients with relapsing-remitting, secondary progressive, and primary progressive disease underwent a 3D-EPSI sequence covering large volumes of STB. Metabolite ratios were first estimated from all voxels within a STB mask using a linear regression of N-acetylaspartate (NAA) over Creatine (Cr), NAA over choline (Cho) and Cho over Cr. Secondly, spectroscopic voxels from a central brain (CB) ROI centered at the corpus callosum were selected within the STB. Ratios were compared using Bland-Altman regression analysis and Spearman's correlation coefficients between STB versus central brain. Ratios from studied ROIs were correlated with the EDSS and compared to normal controls. Results: Very strong correlations ranging from 0.884 and 0.938 (p &lt; 0.0001) were found for all metabolite ratios between STB versus central brain. NAA/Cr ratios were similarly and negatively correlated with the EDSS across all ROIs, trends ranging from -0.257 to -0.314 (p &lt; 0.1). NAA/Cr from all MS patients was similarly decreased compared to controls across all ROIs (p &lt; 0.01). Conclusion: Metabolite ratios from a central brain ROI were statistically equivalent and highly correlated with ratios from the STB. The study of NAA/Cr using <sup>1</sup>HMRS from a central brain ROI centered at the corpus callosum seems to be representative of brainwide axonal changes in patients with MS. © 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

We aimed to investigate whether mapping of T<sub>1</sub> values in critical white matter tracts, defined by diffusion tensor (DT) imaging, could provide a stronger surrogate marker of disability. 25 patients with relapsing-remitting MS and 14 healthy controls were imaged with a dual-echo T<sub>2</sub>-weighted sequence. Whole brain T1 maps were acquired using a multi-slice inversion recovery sequence and DT images generated from a spin-echo, echo-planar diffusion weighted sequence. Trajectories were defined to follow the course of white matter fibre tracts in the pyramidal pathways and corpus callosum. T<sub>1</sub> values were sampled along these trajectories. Total white matter T<sub>1</sub> was sampled by defining white matter masks on axial slices of the T<sub>1</sub> maps. Median T<sub>1</sub> in the pyramidal tracts, corpus callosum and total white matter of MS patients was significantly longer than in controls (p &lt; 0.0001). Median pyramidal tract T<sub>1</sub> correlated significantly with the pyramidal Kurtzke Functional Systems Score (r = 0.64, p = 0.0007) and the Expanded Disability Status Scale (r = 0.55, p = 0.005). By contrast, no correlation with disability was observed for corpus callosum T<sub>1</sub> or total white matter T<sub>1</sub>. Our findings show that quantifying pathology within the pyramidal tracts, by utilizing T<sub>1</sub>, provides a strong correlate of disability compared with the overall white matter burden of disease. Pyramidal tract T<sub>1</sub> may also provide an objective, sensitive measure for monitoring the progression of motor deficits and disability.</p>"

High-resolution baseline MRIs revealed a median of 13 T2 lesions (maximum=103 lesions) and 2.05 cm<sup>3</sup> of T2 lesion volume (maximum 35.04 cm<sup>3</sup>), with 30% of patients having one or more enhancing lesions despite receiving a standardized high-dose course of intravenous corticosteroids. Periventricular, discrete, and juxtacortical T2 lesions were present in 99%, 92% and 67% of the patients, respectively. Large (&gt; 6 mm), T1-hypointense, infratentorial, and corpus callosum lesions were present in 69%, 50%, 55%, and 58%, respectively. Clinical presentation groups showed differences in T2 lesion volume, and enhancing lesion number and volume. At baseline, 97%, 81% and 72% of the patients met 'Paty', 'Fazekas', and 'Barkhof' research criteria for MS, respectively, with the percentages similar according to clinical presentation group.

1357,2-s2.0-0036306920,Intra-voxel and inter-voxel coherence in patients with multiple sclerosis assessed using diffusion tensor MRI,"<p>Previous diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DT-MRI) studies reported mean diffusivity (D̄) and fractional anisotropy (FA) changes in lesions and normal-appearing white matter (NAWM) of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS), but neglected the additional information which can be obtained by the analysis of the inter-voxel coherence (C). The present study is based on a large sample of patients with MS and it is aimed at assessing the potential role of C in the quantification of MS-related tissue damage of T2-visible lesions and NAWM. We obtained dual-echo, T1-weighted and DT-MRI scans from 78 patients with relapsing-remitting (RR), secondary progressive (SP), or primary progressive (PP) MS and from 26 healthy volunteers. We calculated D̄, FA and C of T2-hyperintense lesions, T1-isointense lesions, T1-hypointense lesions and several areas of the NAWM. D̄ and FA of the majority of NAWM regions studied from MS patients were different from the corresponding quantities of the white matter from controls. NAWM C from patients was lower than white matter C from controls only for the parietal pericallosal areas. SPMS patients had higher corpus callosum D̄ and lower corpus callosum FA and C than patients with either RRMS or PPMS. Average lesion D̄ was higher, and average FA and C lower than the corresponding quantities measured in the NAWM. Average T1-hypointense lesion D̄ was higher and average FA lower than the corresponding quantities of T1-isointense lesions, whereas average C of these two lesion populations were not different. SPMS had higher average lesion D̄ than both PPMS and RRMS patients. NAWM D̄ and C of the corpus callosum were moderately correlated with disability. This study confirms the role of DT-MRI metrics to identify MS lesions with different amounts of tissue damage and to detect diffuse changes in the NAWM. It also shows that measuring C enables us to obtain additional information about tissue damage, which is complementary to that given by the analysis of D̄ and FA.</p>"

The staphylococcal enterotoxins (SE) A (SEA), and E, but not B or saline, induced a variable perivascular inflammation in the injected hemisphere (6.7±6.1 cuffs per tissue section with SEA; mean±SD). Adoptive transfer of mitogen activated splenocytes (AS) augmented the response to SEA significantly (18.5±11.4; P&lt;0.05). With or without AS transient bilateral perivascular cuffs were observed around the ventricles and in the corpus callosum up to 3 days after IC injection.

We therefore studied the consequences of demyelination induced by lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) on the axonal cytoskeleton, particularly neurofilaments (NF) and tubulin, in the adult rat corpus callosum. Immunocytochemistry showed that NF immunolabelled fibres decreased by 49% in the LPC injured area at day 15. Since it has been previously demonstrated that PDGF improves remyelination, we performed a comparative study between LPC controls and PDGF-treated (I μg) animals. In these Pater animals, immunolabelling for NFL and NFM (NFH subunit excepted) was increased by 142 and 63%, respectively, indicating reduction of axonal abnormalities.

However, Virchow-Robin spaces (VRSs), especially in early MS, have not been described. Our purpose was to determine the frequency of VRSs in recent-onset MS. METHODS: Brain MR imaging was performed in 71 patients (mean age, 26.8 years; range, 20-41 years; 47 women, 24 men) within 3 months of MS onset. Proton density-, T2-, and TI-weighted images were obtained. Age-and sex-matched control subjects (mean age, 27.2 years; range, 22-41 years; 38 women, 22 men) who underwent brain MR imaging as a part of headache evaluation, and findings that were interpreted as normal served as controls. On high-convexity images (axial sections above the upper corpus callosum border), VRSs were identified as small (&lt;2-mm diameter) sandlike areas isointense to CSF. VRSs were graded 0-3. RESULTS: VRSs were visualized in high-convexity white matter in 55% of patients and 7% of control subjects (P &lt; .001). In patients, 15% of VRSs were grade 1 (fewer than four), 23% were grade 2 (four to seven), and 62% were grade 3 (more than seven). In control subjects, all identified VRSs were grade 1. Among patients with and those without VRSs, age at onset, neurologic disability, and specific functional system involvement or mono-versus polysymptomatic involvement at onset did not differ. CONCLUSION: VRSs were more frequent in patients with recent-onset MS than in control subjects. The sandlike appearance of VRSs may be a neuroradiologic marker that reflects early inflammatory changes in MS.</p>"
1361,2-s2.0-0036548360,The Toll-Like Receptor TLR4 Is Necessary for Lipopolysaccharide-Induced Oligodendrocyte Injury in the CNS,"<p>The immediate or innate immune response is the first line of defense against diverse microbial pathogens and requires the expression of recently discovered toll-like receptors (TLRs). TLR4 serves as a specific receptor for lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and is localized on the surface of a subset of mammalian cells. Although innate immunity is a necessary host defense against microbial pathogens, the consequences of its activation in the CNS can be deleterious, as we show here in a developing neural model. We examined the major non-neuronal cell types in the CNS for expression of TLR4 and found that microglia expressed high levels, whereas astrocytes and oligodendrocytes expressed none. Consistent with TLR4 expression solely in microglia, we show that microglia are the only CNS glial cells that bind fluorescently tagged lipopolysaccharide. Lipopolysaccharide led to extensive oligodendrocyte death in culture only under conditions in which microglia were present. To determine whether TLR4 is necessary for lipopolysaccharide-induced oligodendrocyte death in mixed glial cultures, we studied cultures generated from mice bearing a loss-of-function mutation in the tlr4 gene. Lipopolysaccharide failed to induce oligodendrocyte death in such cultures, in contrast to the death induced in cultures from wild-type mice. Finally, stereotactic intracerebral injection of lipopolysaccharide into the developing pericallosal white matter of immature rodents resulted in loss of oligodendrocytes and hypomyelination and periventricular cysts. Our data provide a general mechanistic link between (1) lipopolysaccharide and similar microbial molecular motifs and (2) injury to oligodendrocytes and myelin as occurs in periventricular leukomalacia and multiple sclerosis.</p>"

Moreover, the influence of the CC on hemispheric specialization in relation to sexual factors is reviewed. We stress the fact that the CC is implicated in many functions. First, this structure is needed for the transfer of interhemispheric information, but it is also important in the attentional distribution between both hemispheres and in the recruitement of computational capacities in the contralateral hemisphere.</p>"
1363,2-s2.0-0036885667,Brain atrophy and cognitive disorder in multiple sclerosis,"<p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease of the central nervous system causing severe disability via the progressive damage of white matter. Beyond physical signs cognitive dysfunction might be present as well. The aim of this study was to investigate the frequency and characteristics of brain atrophy and cognitive alterations. Significant cortical and subcortical atrophy was found on brain MRI of 30 MS patients included in this study comparing to healthy controls. Abnormal findings were detected in more than 60% of patients using a cognitive test battery. Generally, verbal abstraction, visuospatial orientation, attention, short-term memory was impaired and the psychomotor speed was decreased, even in the early stage of the disease. Depression-related complaints were found in 57% of this population. The Kurtzke scale, the atrophy of corpus callosum and widening of 3rd ventricle and Sylvian fissures were related to impaired cognitive performances. The authors would like to call attention to the early cognitive deficit and the need of treatment in MS.</p>"

1365,2-s2.0-0036236624,White matter mapping using diffusion tensor MRI,"<p>Diffusion tensor MRI is used to define trajectories that reflect the long-range order of in vivo white matter (WM) fiber tracts. Fiber tracking is particularly prone to cumulative error from noise and partial volume along the length of the trajectory paths, but the overall shape of each path is anatomically meaningful. By considering only the long-range similarity of path shapes, a method of constructing 3D maps of specific WM structures has been developed. A trajectory is first computed from an operator-selected seed voxel, located within the anatomical structure of interest (SDI). Voxels from the same structure are then automatically identified based on the similarity of trajectory path shapes, assessed using Pearson's correlation coefficient. The corpus callosum and pyramidal tracts in 14 patients with multiple sclerosis, and in 10 healthy controls were mapped by this method, and the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) was measured. The ADC was significantly higher in patients than in controls, and higher in the corpus callosum than in the pyramidal tracts for both groups. Using this method the different functional structures in the WM may be identified and mapped. Within these maps, MRI parameters can be measured for subsequent comparison with relevant clinical data. © 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.</p>"

Patients showed left ear impairment and no left ear advantage in the forced-left condition. Four corpus callosum (CC) regions were measured in patients on a midsaggital magnetic resonance imaging scan. The right ear score was negatively correlated whereas the left ear score was positively correlated with CC regions (significant only for the nonforced condition). Moreover, in men, the correlations with DL scores were linked mainly to the splenium and posterior isthmus, and in women, they were stronger for anterior isthmus and posterior body. An inverse correlation between months of disease evolution and CC area was found only in women.</p>"
1367,2-s2.0-0036128257,Imaging of white matter lesions,"<p>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is very sensitive for the detection of white matter lesions (WML), which occur even in normal ageing. Intrinsic WML should be separated from physiological changes in the ageing brain, such as periventricular caps and bands, and from dilated Virchow-Robin spaces. Genuine WML are best seen with T2-weighted sequences such as long TR dual-echo spin-echo or FLAIR (fluid-attenuated inversion recovery); the latter has the advantage of easily separating WML from CSF-like lesions. Abnormal T2 signal in MRI is not specific, and can accompany any change in tissue composition. In the work-up of WML in small vessel disease, magnetic resonance angiography can be used to rule out (concomitant) large vessel disease, and diffusion-weighted MRI to identify new ischaemic lesions (amidst pre-existing old WML). The differential diagnosis of WML includes hereditary leukodystrophies and acquired disorders. The leukodystrophies that can present in adult age include metachromatic leukodystrophy, globoid cell leukodystrophy, adrenomyeloneuropathy, mitochondrial disorders, vanishing white matter, and cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis. These metabolic disorders typically present with symmetrical abnormalities that can be very diffuse, often with involvement of brainstem and cerebellum. Only the mitochondrial disorders tend to be more asymmetric and frequently involve the grey matter preferentially. Among the acquired white matter disorders, hypoxic-ischaemic causes are by far the most prevalent and without further clinical clues there is no need to even consider the next most common disorder, i.e. multiple sclerosis (MS). Among the nonischaemic disorders, MS is far more common than vasculitis, infection, intoxication and trauma. While vasculitis can mimic small vessel disease, MS has distinctive features with preferential involvement of the subcortical U-fibres, the corpus callosum, temporal lobes and the brainstem/cerebellum. Spinal cord lesions are very common in MS, but do not occur in normal ageing nor in small vessel disease. Copyright © 2002 S. Karger AG, Basel.</p>"
1368,2-s2.0-0035985199,Callosal function in multiple sclerosis: Bimanual motor coordination,"<p>Evidence of callosal dysfunction in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) was examined using a test of bimanual coordination. MS patients were slower than non-patients on the Bimanual Coordination Test (BCT) on both unimanual trials (simple motor speed) and bimanual trials (intermanual coordination). Further, when compared to normals, MS patients exhibited a substantially greater difference between bimanual and unimanual response time, suggesting a deficit in interhemispheric motor interactions. A subgroup of MS subjects who showed markedly inefficient callosal transmission had previously been identified on the basis of abnormal evoked potentials (low amplitude cross-callosal evoked potentials). In comparisons of MS subgroups, the deficit in bimanual motor coordination was found only in MS patients with EP evidence of inefficient callosal transmission. These data support the conclusion that deficits in bimanual motor coordination occur in MS and that these deficits are related to callosal dysfunction.</p>"

A 40-year-old man was admitted due to sudden occurrence of left blurred vision and lasting polyuria. He showed short statue of height of 144 cm and the neurological examination revealed hypesthesia of the left trigeminal nerve and temporal pallor in the left fundus oculi. Brain MR imaging demonstrated agenesis of the septum pellucidum and hypoplasia of the corpus callosum with subcortical spotty lesions, but optic nerve hypoplasia was not detected. The left eye showed a prolonged P100 latency of pattern reversal VEPs. He was diagnosed as having hypopituitarism since growth hormone-releasing factor did not stimulate growth hormone secretion and restriction of water-intake did not induce secretion of antidiuretic hormone. Thus we regarded this case as a variant form of SOPD. The mutation of HESX 1 gene, however, was not detected in the case. P100 of the left eye showed a reduction in latency four months after discharge. This case was considered to be a variant form of SOPD complicated by acute optic neuritis.</p>"
1372,2-s2.0-0035900439,In vivo damage of CNS myelin and axons induced by peroxynitrite,"<p>In multiple sclerosis (MS) the mechanisms of injury caused by peroxynitrite remain uncertain. To study histological, ultra structural and molecular alterations caused by peroxynitrite in brain, the peroxynitrite donor 3-morpholinosydnonimine was injected in rat corpus callosum. Peroxynitrite induces strong primary axonal damage with characteristics of primary acute axonopathy, together with severe myelin alteration, myelin vacuolation and demyelination, and nitrotyrosine formation as confirmed by detection of nitrosated target proteins. Administration of the peroxynitrite scavenger uric acid inhibited these effects. In vivo, peroxynitrite leads to a disorganisation of myelin and to axonal damage presenting some similarities to the formation of MS lesions. Understanding the action of peroxynitrite in this process will open new therapeutic strategies by specific inhibition of peroxynitrite formation and action. © 2001 Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins.</p>"
1373,2-s2.0-0034765063,Immunopathology of secondary-progressive multiple sclerosis,"<p>Twenty-three plaques obtained at early autopsy from 2 patients with secondary-progressive multiple sclerosis were examined immunohistochemically for microglia/macrophages, and for immunoglobulins and components of activated complement. Most of the lesions examined in both cases exhibited evidence of low-grade active demyelination of an unusual type (frustrated phagocytosis) in periplaque white matter. This included linear groups of microglia engaging short segments of disrupted myelin that were associated with deposits of C3d, an opsonin formed during complement activation. Similar microglia/C3d/myelin profiles were not observed in newly forming lesions in cases of acute multiple sclerosis or other central white matter diseases. As C3d coupling is known to increase the immunogenicity of potential antigens enormously, present findings point to disrupted myelin close to plaques as a possible source of the putative multiple sclerosis antigen. Ongoing myelin destruction found in a high proportion of old, established plaques was surprising. It suggests that slowly expanding lesions (progressive plaques), in which ongoing myelin breakdown occurs in the absence of florid perivascular cell cuffing or other histological signs of acute inflammation, contribute to disease progression in cases of secondary-progressive multiple sclerosis.</p>"
1374,2-s2.0-0034843364,Cognitive correlates of supratentorial atrophy on MRI in multiple sclerosis,"<p>Objectives - We aimed to investigate associations between neuropsychological indices and normalized volumes of supratentorial structures, and the area of the corpus callosum. Materials and methods - We studied 40 patients with clinically definite MS, using 3D-acquired MRI (MPRAGE, Magnetization Prepared Rapid Acquisition Gradient Echo) and stereology. Subjects underwent a neuropsychological battery interrogating multiple cognitive domains, from which a global Cognitive Index Score (CIS) was derived. Results - White matter volumes were significantly correlated with CIS (rho = -0.59, P&lt;0.0001) and with many of the individual cognitive tests. CIS was also significantly correlated with the corpus callosal area (tho = -0.49, P&lt;0.002). Grey matter volumes did not significantly correlate with any cognitive test. Conclusions - These volume/function relationships presumably reflect the effects of subcortical axonal and myelin loss on the neural networks that subserve cognition. If serial MRI volume estimations can index accumulating cognitive deficits, this simple technique may be useful in therapeutic trials.</p>"
1375,2-s2.0-0035883161,Interleukin-1β promotes repair of the CNS,"<p>Interleukin-1β (IL-1β) is a proinflammatory cytokine associated with the pathophysiology of demyelinating disorders such as multiple sclerosis and viral infections of the CNS. However, we demonstrate here that IL-1β appears to promote remyelination in the adult CNS. In IL-1β<sup>-/-</sup> mice, acute demyelination progressed similarly to wild-type mice and showed parallel mature oligodendrocyte depletion, microglia-macrophage accumulation, and the appearance of oligodendrocyte precursors. In contrast, IL-1β<sup>-/-</sup> mice failed to remyelinate properly, and this appeared to correlate with a lack of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) production by microglia-macrophages and astrocytes and to a profound delay of precursors to differentiate into mature oligodendrocytes. Thus, IL-1β may be crucial to the repair of the CNS, presumably through the induction of astrocyte and microglia-macrophage-derived IGF-1.</p>"

Material and methods - A well defined cohort of patients was drawn at random from the general MS population by using the Danish Multiple Sclerosis Registry. A semi-automated local thresholding technique was used to quantify T <sub>2</sub>-weighted lesions on MRI; whereas manual tracing was applied to measure the corpus callosum brain ratio (CCR) and the ventricle brain ratio (VBR). Results - A sample of 86 patients with a mean age of 43.3 years (SD 4.3), mean disease duration of 13.6 years (SD 4.4) and a median Expanded Disability Status Score (EDSS) of 6.0 was identified. The correlation between total lesion area of the brain (TLA) and disability (EDSS) for the whole sample was moderate (Spearman rank correlation coefficient r=0.48, P&lt;0.001). Also correlations of CCR and VBR to disability (r = 0.32-0.46) were significant. Conclusions - Correlations of TLA and disability in this study were rather strong. Hence, T <sub>2</sub>-weighted MRI lesion load in the brain still plays an important role as a surrogate marker of disease and as a secondary outcome measure in phase III treatment trials.</p>"
1378,2-s2.0-0034967446,Twenty-nine years after carbon monoxide intoxication,"<p>Carbon monoxide (CO) is a worldwide environmental toxin and a leading cause of deliberate or accidental poisoning. There is an extensive literature devoted to the clinical features and treatment of those victims who have survived acute CO poisoning for a short length of time. The long-term sequelae of non-fatal poisoning have received scanty references, and the prospects for the long-lasting survivors of acute CO intoxication are less clear. Literature review uncovered reports of only three patients who were followed for a considerable period of time. We present a case of CO poisoning with progressive neurological and psychological deterioration that began 17 years after recovery from a severe, accidental CO asphyxia. The patient was examined in the neurology out patient clinic 29 years after the initial CO intoxication. We believe the unique status of this patient, her similarity to one other case in the literature and the circumstances allowing correlation of the clinical picture to the CO poisoning warrants emphasis.

1379,2-s2.0-0034981030,Water diffusion in elevated in widespread regions of normal-appearing white matter in multiple sclerosis and correlates with diffusion in focal lesions,"<p>Pathological changes in the normal-appearing white matter in multiple sclerosis are well recognised, but their relationship to pathology in focal lesions is not well understood. Magnetic resonance diffusion imaging is sensitive to abnormalities in the integrity, size and geometry of water spaces in brain tissue. This study investigated the anatomical distribution of normal-appearing white matter diffusion abnormalities and their relationship to diffusion in focal lesions in multiple sclerosis (MS). The average apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC<sub>av</sub>) was measured by three-axis echoplanar diffusion imaging in normal-appearing white matter regions and lesions throughout the brain in 40 patients, and in white matter in 14 matched controls. The correlation between the ADC<sub>av</sub> in normal-appearing white matter and lesions was determined. In controls and patients, diffusion was highest in the corpus callosum. Patients had a higher mean ADC<sub>av</sub> than controls in widespread regions including the corpus callosum, cerebellar, temporal and occipital normal-appearing white matter. Mean normal-appearing white matter ADC<sub>av</sub> correlated strongly with mean lesion ADC<sub>av</sub> (r=0.67, P&lt;0.001). This study demonstrates that water diffusion is elevated in widespread areas of normal-appearing white matter in MS, and is correlated with diffusion in lesions. These findings suggest that the pathogenetic mechanisms causing tissue damage in lesions and normal-appearing white matter are at least party linked.</p>"
1380,2-s2.0-0035942351,MRI and CSF oligoclonal bands after autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in MS,"<p>Objective: To analyze the MRI and CSF oligoclonal bands (OB) changes in patients with MS who underwent an autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (AHSCT). Background: AHSCT is evaluated as an alternative therapy in severe MS. In previous series of AHSCT for MS, data on MRI or OB outcome were limited or not provided. Methods: Five patients with a median Kurtzke's EDSS score of 6.5, more than two attacks, and confirmed worsening of the EDSS in the previous year received an AHSCT. Hematopoietic stem cells were mobilized with cyclophosphamide (3 g/m2) and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (5 μg/kg/d). The graft was T cell depleted by positive CD 34+ selection. Conditioning regimen included BCNU (300 mg/m<sup>2</sup>), cyclophosphamide (150 mg/kg in 3 days), and antithymocyte globulin (60 mg/kg in 4 days). MRI scans were scheduled at baseline and 1, 3, 6, and 12 months and OB analysis at baseline and 3 and 12 months post-AHSCT. Results: Four patients had a stable or improved EDSS after a median follow-up of 18 months (range, 12 to 24 months). The fifth patient's condition deteriorated during AHSCT. She partially improved and remained stable after month 3 after AHSCT. The baseline CSF OB persisted 1 year after AHSCT. MRI studies after AHSCT showed no enhanced T1 lesions and no new or enlarging T2 lesions. The median percentage change of T2 lesion load was -11.8% (range, -26.6 to -4.0%). All patients had a decrease of corpus callosum area at 1 year (median, 12.4%; range, 7.8% to 20.5%) that did not progress in the two patients evaluated at 2 years after AHSCT. Conclusions: Although the persistence of CSF OB suggests the lymphocytes were not eliminated from the CNS, the follow-up MRI studies showed no enhanced T1 brain lesions and a reduction in the T2 lesion load that correlated with the clinical stabilization of MS after AHSCT.</p>"

MRI findings were correlated with clinical course and characteristic differences from adult-onset RRMS were elaborated. Methods: Two girls and one boy with true childhood-onset, and one girl with juvenile-onset RRMS underwent 5-16 MRI examinations within 6-8 years. The total number of lesions, the numbers of new, active, disappearing and reappearing lesions, infratentorial and U-fibre lesions, ""giant"" plaques and ""black holes"" were counted. Callosal atrophy and general brain atrophy were assessed. The findings were related to the physical status according to the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS). Results and Conclusions: Results showed that the primary differences in childhood-onset RRMS compared to adult-onset RRMS lie in the lack of, or slower development of irreversible changes (""black hole"" formation, brain atrophy). Despite callosal atrophy and intensive U-fibre region involvement, school performance was unchanged. Regarding the frequency of ""giant"" lesions, an even more pronounced white matter involvement was found in our children compared to adults. All children exhibited a rather ""benign"" disease course. A more intensive remyelination, less severe neuronal loss, and higher functional brain plasticity at younger ages may account for these differences.</p>"

Methods - The clinical and laboratory investigations and radiological manifestations of these patients were documented. Results - Each patient had two or more acute attacks of demyelinating disease affecting the CNS. The clinical presentations of the patients were predominantly those of multiphasic neuromyelitis optica (NMO). Brain MRI in these patients showed features consistent with those described for acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM), as well as lesions that are described in multiple sclerosis. There was involvement of the corpus callosum in addition to typical ADEM lesions. Laboratory investigations excluded all other known causes of multiphasic CNS demyelination. Oligoclonal antibodies were not detected in these patients at any time. The patients were all from a population with a low risk for MS (black South Africans). Conclusion - The patients described here represent a new phenotypic expression of a recurrent (multiphasic), steroid sensitive, inflammatory demyelinating disorder of the CNS occurring in black South Africans. The disorder is either a distinct inflammatory demyelinating disorder of the CNS of as yet unknown aetiology, or a varied form of MS (ADEM/NMO) occurring in a population with a low risk (where the genetic trait and environmental risk factors for MS do not exist) for MS.</p>"
1383,2-s2.0-0035681270,Cognitive dysfunction and histological findings in adult rats one year after whole brain irradiation,"<p>Cognitive dysfunction and histological changes in the brain were investigated following irradiation in 20 Fischer 344 rats aged 6 months treated with whole brain irradiation (WBR) (25 Gy/single dose), and compared with the same number of sham-irradiated rats as controls. Performance of the Morris water maze task and the passive avoidance task were examined one year after WBR. Finally, histological and immunohistochemical examinations using antibodies to myelin basic protein (MBP), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and neurofilament (NF) were performed of the rat brains. The irradiated rats continued to gain weight 7 months after WBR whereas the control rats stopped gaining weight. Cognitive functions in both the water maze task and the passive avoidance task were lower in the irradiated rats than in the control rats. Brain damage consisting of demyelination only or with necrosis was found mainly in the body of the corpus callosum and the parietal white matter near the corpus callosum in the irradiated rats. Immunohistochemical examination of the brains without necrosis found MBP-positive fibers were markedly decreased in the affected areas by irradiation; NF-positive fibers were moderately decreased and irregularly dispersed in various shapes in the affected areas; and GFAP-positive fibers were increased, with gliosis in those areas. These findings are similar to those in clinically accelerated brain aging in conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, Binswanger's disease, and multiple sclerosis.</p>"

Methods: We compared 30 patients who had clinically definite early-onset replasing-remitting MS and mild disability with control subjects. Regional and segmental callosal size and extent of white matter abnormalities on magnetic resonance imaging, as well as performance on tasks exploring interhemispheric transfer of motor, auditory, and sensory information were assessed. Patients with MS were evaluated at baseline and after 5 years. Physical disability was determined at both times using the Expanded Disability Status Scale score. Results: Patients with MS were seen with significant callosal atrophy and functional impairment of interhemispheric transfer at baseline that worsened during the 5-year study. A significant correlation was found between the magnitude of disability and the severity of morphological and functional callosal involvement at baseline. This association persisted at year 5. Baseline clinical characteristics such as age and prestudy relapse rate were unrelated to callosal size or interhemispheric performance. However, the number of baseline T2-weighted lesions was correlated with callosal involvement and this relation persisted at year 5. Conclusion: Patients who had relapsing-remitting MS in the early stages of the disease and mild disability had significant callosal involvement that progressed over time. The relationship between disability, T2-weighted lesions load, and degree of morphological and functional callosal impairment confirm the potential value of using callosal dysfunction as a surrogate marker of disease progression in MS.</p>"
1385,2-s2.0-0035062231,Distribution of some extracellular matrix proteins and ultrastructural findings in sural nerve biopsy in demyelinating disease,"<p>The involvement of both the peripheral nervous system (PNS) and central nervous system (CNS) in multiple sclerosis is a seldom encountered combination in neurology clinics. In this report, immunohistochemical and ultrastructural techniques were used to analyse the disease course of a patient exhibiting involvement of both systems. In 1980, a 44-year-old man was admitted to our clinic with progressive weakness and decreased sensation of the right lower extremity, and sensory abnormality exhibiting stocking distribution. In electromyolography (EMG), demyelinating sensory motor polyneuropathy was determined. Ten years later, he was admitted again due to progression of weakness in the four extremities. Pyramidal and cerebellar signs, and loss of deep sensation were included in the clinical picture. An EMG investigation revealed severe segmental demyelination. Hyperintense lesions were determined in the periventricular deep white matter and the corpus callosum using cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This patient was considered to be exhibiting a course of demyelinating disease in which PNS and CNS were involved. In order to eliminate other reasons for peripheral neuropathy (PN), a sural nerve biopsy was carried out. The expression of several extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins (fibronectin, laminin, collagen type-IV), their respective receptors (integrin α5 and β4 subunits), intermediate filaments (vimentin) and S-100 protein was investigated by means of immunohistochemical methods. In addition, peripheral nerve tissue samples were evaluated ultrastructurally. Immunohistochemical stainings revealed an increase in the expression of ECM molecules, such as fibronectin, laminin and collagen type-IV, and their respective receptors, α5 and β4. This alteration might be a result of a Schwann-axon relationship. Vimentin expression was found to have changed in the Schwann cells and S-100 immunoreactivity decreased in the region near the Schwann-axon interface. Our ultrastructral findings showed myelin fragmentation, axon vacuolisation and degeneration.</p>"
1386,2-s2.0-0035010232,Central nervous system disease in patients with macrophagic myofasciitis,"<p>Macrophagic myofasciitis (MMF), a condition newly recognized in France, is manifested by diffuse myalgias and characterized by highly specific myopathological alterations which have recently been shown to represent an unusually persistent local reaction to intramuscular injections of aluminium-containing vaccines.

CNS manifestations included hemisensory or sensorimotor symptoms (four out of seven), bilateral pyramidal signs (six out of seven), cerebellar signs (four out of seven), visual loss (two out of seven), cognitive and behavioural disorders (one out of seven) and bladder dysfunction (one out of seven). Brain T<sub>2</sub>-weighted MRI showed single (two out of seven) or multiple (four out of seven) supratentorial white matter hyperintense signals and corpus callosum atrophy (one out of seven).

According to Poser's criteria for multiple sclerosis, the diagnosis was clinically definite (five out of seven) or clinically probable multiple sclerosis (two out of seven). Six out of seven patients had diffuse myalgias. Deltoid muscle biopsy showed stereotypical accumulations of PAS (periodic acid-Schiff)-positive macrophages, sparse CD8 + T cells and minimal myofibre damage. Aluminium-containing vaccines had been administered 3-78 months (median = 33 months) before muscle biopsy (hepatitis B virus: four out of seven, tetanus toxoid: one out of seven, both hepatitis B virus and tetanus toxoid: two out of seven). The association between MMF and multiple sclerosis-like disorders may give new insights into the controversial issues surrounding vaccinations and demyelinating CNS disorders. Deltoid muscle biopsy searching for myopathological alterations of MMF should be performed in multiple sclerosis patients with diffuse myalgias.</p>"
1387,2-s2.0-0033665233,Classification of acquired lesions of the corpus callosum with MRI,"<p>MRI has facilitated diagnostic assessment of the corpus callosum. Diagnostic classification of solitary or multiple lesions of the corpus callosum has not attracted much attention, although signal abnormalities are not uncommon. Our aim was to identify characteristic imaging features of lesions frequently encountered in practice. We reviewed the case histories of 59 patients with lesions shown on MRI. The nature of the lesions was based on clinical features and/or long term follow-up (ischaemic 20, Virchow-Robin spaces 3, diffuse axonal injury 7, multiple sclerosis 11, hydrocephalus 5, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis 5, Marchiafava-Bignami disease 4, lymphoma 2, glioblastoma hamartoma each 1). The location in the sagittal plane, the relationship to the borders of the corpus callosum and midline and the size were documented. The 20 ischaemic lesions were asymmetrical but adjacent to the midline; the latter was involved in new or large lesions. Diffuse axonal injury commonly resulted in large lesions, which tended to be asymmetrical; the midline and borders of the corpus callosum were always involved. Lesions in MS were small, at the lower border of the corpus callosum next to the septum pellucidum, and crossed the midline asymmetrically. Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis and the other perivenous inflammatory diseases caused relatively large, asymmetrical lesions. Hydrocephalus resulted in lesions of the upper part of the corpus callosum, and mostly in its posterior two thirds; they were found in the midline. Lesions in Marchiafava-Bignami disease were large, often symmetrically in the midline in the splenium and did not reach the edge of the corpus callosum.</p>"
1388,2-s2.0-0033667239,Neuroradiological aspects of multiple sclerosis,"<p>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has developed without doubt to the most important investigation method in multiple sclerosis. MRI is very sensitive to detect MS lesions but unfortunately of limited specificity. The purpose of this review is 1. to work UP the MRI characteristics of MS lesions, 2. to derive recommendations for MRT-protocolls for daily radiological work and 3. to discuss new MR developments. MS lesions in the acute inflammatory stage show first an enhancement of GD-DTPA due to break down of the blood brain barrier and develop a T2-hyperintensity due to an edema. The following disease course is categorized in a phase of reparation and remyelinisation respectively, of gliosis and a defect stage. MS-plaques in the remyelinisation and gliotic phase appear as hyperintens lesion on T2-weighted scans. Chronic MS lesions with a defect are also T2-hyperintens and demonstrate additionally due to severe axonal loss a hypointensity on short TR SE scans. MS lesions exhibit a characteristic distribution. They are found typically periventricular, in the corpus callosum and at the calloso-septal interface, cortico-subcortical and infratentorial. The most important MR criteria to predict conversion from suspected (CSMS) to clinical definite MS (CDMS) are GD-DTPA enhancement and juxtacortical lesion localisation followed by the parameter periventricular and infratentorial localisation. Based on guidelines for the use of MRI in drug studies and on equivalent recommendations for the routine diagnostic we suggest rational and economic MRT protocols for cerebral, spinal, and N. opticus investigations. Such standardised protocols shall help to make MRI investigations more efficient and better comparable. New MR developments include measurement of magnetisation transfer and T2-relaxation, diffusion weighted imaging, proton MR spectroscopy, and quantification of lesion load. These methods can analyse more specifically tissue changes in MS plaques and yet can reveal changes in normal appearing white matter.</p>"

1390,2-s2.0-0034446552,Brain and spinal cord atrophy in multiple sclerosis,"<p>We have evidence that atrophy occurs early in the disease process - far earlier than originally anticipated. This has important implications for early treatment of MS patients, because once it is detectable, atrophy likely indicates destructive, irreversible changes, and subclinical impairment, if not overt disability. Future prospective studies will be required to identify patients at risk for accelerated atrophy, and to determine the neuropsychological and clinical consequences of atrophy. Whereas treatment designed to prevent or delay the development of CDMS in the earliest stages of recognizable disease is known to be effective,<sup>39</sup> further studies will be required to determine if treatment also delays irreversible injury to the CNS, as indicated by atrophy and other MR imaging measures, over the long term. Atrophy measures may provide the appropriate metric for the evaluation of disease in primary progressive MS, in testing combined MS therapies, and in tests of neuroprotective agents. Finally, the role of atrophy measures in individuals has not been determined. In theory, these measures may provide an assessment of disease at one point in time, or serially, once technique, including high resolution MR imaging acquisitions, and computerized post-processing are optimized for this purpose. That time may be near.</p>"

Method: Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was used to assess resting and facilitated motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) of abductor pollicus brevis (APB) and flexor carpi radialis (FCR) muscles before and after fatiguing exercise. Exercise-induced depletion and recovery of phosphocreatine (PCr) were measured using <sup>31</sup>P magnetic resonance spectroscopy (<sup>31</sup>PMRS) in FCR. Results and conclusion: MS subjects demonstrated significantly lower peak force and a faster decline in force than controls. Contralateral muscle activation (hand grip) before the fatigue protocol resulted in significantly increased MEP amplitudes in all groups. Contralateral hand grip following fatiguing exercise resulted in significantly higher MEP amplitudes in controls and MS-NM subjects, but not MS-W subjects. Fatiguing exercise resulted in prolonged central motor conduction time (CMCT) in MS subjects, but not controls. No group differences in PCr depletion or resynthesis were observed. All groups demonstrated significant post-exercise depression (PED) of MEP amplitude that persisted beyond the time course of PCr recovery, indicating fatigue was central in origin. MS subjects were less able than controls to increase cortical excitability using contralateral muscle activation following fatiguing exercise, possibly indicating impaired conduction in the corpus callosum.

Cognitive and psychic disorders in Multiple Sclerosis (MS) patients both in early and late stages of the disease have been reported by several Authors. They are frequently related to demyelinating lesions in specific sites of the Central Nervous System (CNS). Recently, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) has given the opportunity to carry out anatomical-clinical correlation studies in vivo. A neuropsychological and neuroimaging study was carried out in 63 MS patients to asses any possible correlation between cognitive decline and/or psychic disorders and demyelination sites. Our findings suggest that corpus callosum lesions and subcortical atrophy are significantly related to the cognitive and/or psychic impairment. Neuropsychological assessment in MS patients, besides clinical and paraclinical investigations, is an important tool to reveal early cognitive changes and to consider an early cognitive rehabilitation.</p>"
1393,2-s2.0-0034283332,In vivo evaluation of remyelination in rat brain by magnetization transfer imaging,"<p>The aim of this work was to assess quantitatively and qualitatively the ability of magnetization transfer imaging to follow in vivo remyelination. Demyelination lesions were induced in rats by the injection of L-α- lysophosphatidylcholine stearoyl into the corpus callosum and imaging was performed in vivo on a 4.7-Tesla system at different time points. The percentage of magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) decrease was calculated for each animal. To evaluate the MTR findings for remyelination, myelin was quantitated by histological analysis of the lesion size and counting the number of remyelinating axons. An MTR decrease was observed when demyelination was present at 7 days after injection. During the remyelinating phase between day 30 and 40 after injection, contralateral values almost complete returned to normal, thus indicating remyelination. Histologically, at days 30 and 40 after injection, the lesion area was reduced in size and the axons were surrounded by a thin myelin sheath, indicating the remyelination process. Statistical analysis showed that the profile of MTR values was significantly correlated with the course of remyelination. All the MTR changes show a correlation with both myelin damage and repair. In conclusion, the study of the MTR profile in this myelin lesion model demonstrates in vivo the loss of myelin and the presence of spontaneous remyelination. This methodological approach which can also be applied to multiple sclerosis patients to show demyelination, should prove helpful to determine the degree of spontaneous and therapeutically induced remyelination in multiple sclerosis lesions, and thus to validate therapeutic treatments for myelin repair.

1395,2-s2.0-0034014767,Conduction deficits of callosal fibres in early multiple sclerosis,"<p>Objective. To study the diagnostic usefulness of transcallosal inhibition (TI) elicited by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in detecting central conduction deficits in early multiple sclerosis. Corticospinally mediated excitatory responses evoked by TMS are accepted as a sensitive diagnostic tool in multiple sclerosis. Recently, TI evoked by TMS has been introduced as a new paradigm to test the function of callosal fibres interconnecting both hand associated motor cortices. Methods. Focal TMS of the motor cortex was performed in 50 patients with early relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. Corticospinally mediated (central motor latencies, amplitudes) and transcallosally mediated (onset latency and duration of TI) stimulation effects were investigated. Results. TMS disclosed abnormalities of corticospinally mediated responses in 62% and of TI in 80% of the patients. Conclusion. The assessment of TI allows the discovery of lesions within the periventricular white matter that were not accessible by neurophysiological techniques before. This new paradigm increases the sensitivity of TMS with which to detect central conduction deficits in early multiple sclerosis.</p>"

These results confirm substantial axonal loss in the normal appearing white matter and demonstrate that measures of both axonal density and white matter volume are necessary to appreciate the full extent of axonal loss.</p>"
1397,2-s2.0-0034653442,"Brain atrophy in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis: Relationship with 'black holes', disease duration and clinical disability","<p>Recent MRI studies in multiple sclerosis have highlighted the potential role of brain atrophy evaluation as a putative marker of disease progression. In the present study, we evaluated the supratentorial and infratentorial brain volume in patients with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RR MS) and in healthy subjects. Moreover, we determined whether brain volumes of MS patients are associated with different aspects of brain MRI abnormalities and clinical findings. Two-dimensional acquired MRI was performed on 52 relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis and 30 healthy subjects. The volume of supratentorial and infratentorial structures was measured in selected representative slices. Gd-enhancement, T2 hyperintense, T1 hypointense (i.e. 'black holes') total lesion load, as well as the area of corpus callosum was calculated in the MS group and related to brain volume measures. Correlations between MRI parameters and clinical features were also considered. MS patients had significantly lower supratentorial, infratentorial brain volume and corpus callosum area than healthy subjects (P&lt;0.01). Supratentorial brain volume was significantly related to corpus callosum area (r=0.58; P&lt;0.01) and T1 hypointense lesion load (r=0.48; P&lt;0.01), but not with T2 hyperintense lesion load. Infratentorial/supratentorial ratio was significantly associated with disease duration and EDSS score (r=-0.34; P=0.02 and r=-0.49; P&lt;0.01, respectively). This study documents that brain atrophy is an early MRI finding in RR MS and it is closely related to 'black holes' burden. The use of relative values (infratentorial/supratentorial ratio) may increase the conspicuity of correlation between clinical and MRI findings. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.</p>"

1399,2-s2.0-0034258601,Interhemispheric transfer evaluation in multiple sclerosis,"<p>Patients suffering from Multiple Sclerosis (MS) have frequently been found to suffer from damage to callosal fibers. Investigations have shown that this damage is associated with signs of hemisphere disconnections. The aim of our study was to provide evidence for the first signs of interhemispheric dysfunction in a mildly disabled MS population. Therefore, we explored whether the Interhemispheric Transfer (IT) deficit is multi-modal and sought to differentiate two MS evolution forms, on the basis of an interhemispheric disconnection index. Twentytwo patients with relapsing-remitting form of MS (RRMS) and 14 chronic-progressive (CPMS) were compared with matched controls on four tasks: a tachistoscopic verbal and non-verbal decision task, a dichotic listening test, cross tactile finger localization and motor tapping. No overall impairment was seen. The dichotic listening and lexical decision tasks were the most sensitive to MS. In addition, CPMS patients' IT was more impaired and was related to the severity of neurological impairment. The different sizes of the callosal fibers, which determine their vulnerability, may explain the heterogeneity of transfer through the Corpus Callosum. Therefore, evaluation of IT may be of value as an index of evolution in MS.</p>"
1400,2-s2.0-0033849266,Regional axonal loss in the corpus callosum correlates with cerebral white matter lesion volume and distribution in multiple sclerosis,"<p>Previous imaging studies have suggested that there is substantial axonal loss in the normal-appearing white matter (NAWM) of brains from multiple sclerosis patients and that this axonal loss may be an important determinant of disability. Recently, substantial axonal loss in the NAWM has been confirmed directly in post-mortem tissue. Whether the NAWM changes occur as a consequence of damage to axons traversing lesions or to a more diffuse injury process is uncertain. Using formalin-fixed brains of eight multiple sclerosis patients and eight age-matched controls, we examined the relationship between demyelinating lesion load in three volumes of the cerebral white matter and the loss of axons in NAWM of the corresponding three projection regions (anterior, middle, posterior) in the corpus callosum (CC). There was a significant loss of calculated total number of axons crossing the CC in each of the three regions relative to the non-multiple sclerosis controls. Strong correlations were found between the regional lesion load and both the axonal density (r = -0.673, P = 0.001) and the total estimated number of axons crossing the corresponding projection area in the CC (r = -0.656, P = 0.001) for the patients. This suggests that Wallerian degeneration of axons transected in the demyelinating lesions makes a major contribution to the substantial, diffuse loss of axons in the NAWM in multiple sclerosis. These findings emphasize the need to consider the consequences of multiple sclerosis lesions in terms of both local and distant effects in functionally connected regions of the brain.</p>"

1402,2-s2.0-0344131931,Intraventricular transplantation of oligodendrocyte progenitors into a fetal myelin mutant results in widespread formation of myelin,"<p>Transplantation of myelin-forming cells is a promising strategy for the treatment of myelin disorders. In this study, transplantation of glial cell progenitors into the cerebral ventricles of the embryonic myelin-deficient rat, a model of Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease, was performed to assess the ability of these cells to incorporate into the developing brain and produce myelin. The donor cells migrated into the white and gray matter and produced myelin at widespread sites ranging from the corpus callosum and optic nerve to the cerebellum. These data suggest that myelin repair might be achieved by intraventricular delivery and transependymal incorporation of myelin- producing cells. Because these cells were genetically transduced to express a reporter gene, similar ex vivo manipulation with genes known to promote survival, migration, or proliferation of the transplanted cells could be used to enhance repair. Such a therapeutic strategy may be feasible in patients with inherited myelin disorders or in multiple sclerosis, particularly where the lesions are periventricular.</p>"
1403,2-s2.0-0033551457,A longitudinal study of brain atrophy in relapsing multiple sclerosis,"<p>Objective: To determine if progressive brain atrophy could be detected over 1- and 2-year intervals in relapsing MS, based on annual MR studies from the Multiple Sclerosis Collaborative Research Group (MSCRG) trial of interferon β-1a (Avonex). Methods: All subjects had mild to moderate disability, with baseline expanded disability status scores ranging from 1.0 to 3.5, and at least two relapses in the 3 years before study entry. Atrophy measures included third and lateral ventricle width, brain width, and corpus callosum area. Results: Significant increases were detected in third ventricle width at year 2 and lateral ventricle width at 1 and 2 years. Significant decreases in corpus callosum area and brain width were also observed at 1 and 2 years. Multiple regression analyses suggested that the number of gadolinium-enhancing lesions at baseline was the single significant contributor to change in third ventricle width. Atrophy over 1 and 2 years as indicated by enlargement of the third and lateral ventricle and shrinkage of the corpus callosum was greater for patients entering the trial with enhancing lesions. Greater disability increments over 1 and 2 years were associated with more severe third ventricle enlargement. Conclusion: In patients with relapsing MS and only mild to moderate disability, significant cerebral atrophy is already developing that can be measured over periods of only 1 to 2 years. The course of cerebral atrophy in MS appears to be influenced by prior inflammatory disease activity as indicated by the presence of enhancing lesions. Brain atrophy measures are important markers of MS disease progression because they likely reflect destructive and irreversible pathologic processes.</p>"

To determine the prevalence of neurological and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) abnormalities in a well defined population of unselected patients with primary Sjogren's syndrome (SS) and age and sex matched healthy patients. Methods. Thirty patients with SS and 29 age and sex matched controls were examined by a neurologist and subsequently underwent MRI scanning with a 1.0 Tesla Siemens Impact MR scanner. Scans were graded by a neuroradiologist blinded to the clinical status of each subject. The number and location of white matter lesions &gt; 3 mm in long axis (to exclude non- specific perivascular changes) were recorded for each subject. Results. There was a significant increase in lesions detected by MRI in SS patients versus controls (p = 0.02) including deep white matter lesions (p = 0.03) and subcortical white matter lesions (p = 0.02). The presence of white matter lesions did not correlate with serum IgG or rheumatoid factor levels, or with presence of anticardiolipin antibodies. No subjects had symptoms or signs of serious neurological disease including multiple sclerosis, and corpus callosal lesions commonly seen in multiple sclerosis were notably absent in this study. Conclusion. Cerebral white matter lesions detected by MRI are more frequent in patients with primary SS than control subjects, yet do not appear to be associated with significant clinical manifestations. Although the pathological nature of these lesions is yet to be defined, their presence should not be over-interpreted.</p>"
1405,2-s2.0-0033022459,Magnetic resonance imaging in multiple sclerosis,"<p>Useful characteristics of MRI finding of multiple sclerosis (MS) include the distribution of lesions such as a strictly periventricular, infratentorial, or juxtacortical location, involvement of the corpus callosum and the presence of ovoid lesions with long axis directed to lateral ventricles. Our MRI-diagnostic criteria improved the sensitivity and specificity and is clinically useful. New sequences, such as fast spin echo, turbo spin echo or fluid attenuated inversion recovery have improved the detection of lesions. The presence of contrast enhancement in some but not all lesions - that is, evidence of both old and new lesions - provides additional diagnostic support. Enhanced lesions with more than 1 cm diameter often become ring-shaped. Strong correlations were found between the number and volume of enhancing lesions with changes of T 2 and magnetization transfer (MT) lesion loads in patients with secondary progressive MS. The degree of hypointensity of so called black holes on moderately T1-weighted spin echo images correlates with loss of magnetisation transfer, a marker of destruction of matrix and axon, and shows correlation with disability. One of spectroscopic indices of axonal loss is N-acetylaspartate. Atrophy is a process closely linked with the progressive phase of MS and worsening disability. Detection of the reduction in cord cross-sectional area or spinal cord atrophy over time makes an important contribution to the evaluation of therapeutic efficacy, especially in primary progressive disease.</p>"
1406,2-s2.0-0033137124,Distribution of transferrin and ferritin binding in normal and multiple sclerotic human brains,"<p>Delivery of iron to the brain traditionally has been considered the responsibility of transferrin. However, transferrin receptors in brain are located primarily within gray matter areas rather than in the iron rich white matter tracts. In this report we present the first demonstration of ferritin binding sites in human brain and provide evidence that these binding sites are primarily in white matter tracts. This distribution of ferritin binding is opposite of that seen for the distribution of the transferrin receptor in normal adult human brain. Ferritin binds to human brain tissue in a competitive and saturable manner with a dissociation constant of 0.35 nM and a binding site density of 116.7 fmol/mg protein. In brain tissue from multiple sclerotic (MS) patients the normal pattern of transferrin and ferritin binding distributions is disrupted. Ferritin binding is absent in the lesion itself and in the immediate periplaque region within the white matter but returns to normal as the distance from the lesion becomes greater. In direct contrast to ferritin binding, transferrin binding in the MS tissue is present in the white matter tracts, but only in the periplaque region. The periplaque region also contains transferrin receptor positive cells (as determined by immunocytochemistry) morphologically consistent with oligodendrocytes. Gray matter binding of transferrin in MS patients appears normal. These data provide the initial evidence of ferritin binding in human brain, address the enigma of the apparent absence of an iron delivery system to the iron-rich white matter, and suggest loss of ferritin binding is involved in or is a consequence of demyelination associated with MS.</p>"
1407,2-s2.0-0344654689,Demyelination and axonal degeneration in corpus callosum assessed by analysis of transcallosally mediated inhibition in multiple sclerosis,"<p>Objective: Following focal transcranial magnetic cortex stimulation (fTMS), inhibition of voluntary EMG activity in the ipsilateral first dorsal interosseus (FDI) muscle was studied, in order to assess the functional integrity of the corpus callosum in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). Methods and results: Thirty-four patients suffering from definite MS and 12 healthy, age-matched normal subjects were examined. In mid-sagittal slices, 29 patients showed lesions within the truncus corporis callosi in T2- weighted MRI. In 20 patients, all areas (anterior, middle and posterior parts), in one both the anterior and posterior part, in 3 exclusively the anterior, in 4 the middle and in one the posterior area were affected. In 5 patients, lesions of corpus callosum were lacking. In normal subjects, fTMS elicited a transient inhibition (TI) of preactivated (50% of maximal force) isometric voluntary ipsilateral FDI muscle activity. Mean onset latencies of TI were 35.5 ± 5.4 ms in right and 36.1 ± 4.2 ms in left FDI. Mean duration of TI amounted to 23.0 ± 8.4 ms for right and 24.6 ± 8.4 ms for left FDI. In the MS group, TI latencies were significantly increased in 23 and TI durations in 16 cases, whereas a lack of TI was found in 5 patients bilaterally and in 6 unilaterally. In patients, mean onset latencies of TI were 40.4 ± 13.8 ms in right and 43.3 ± 14.4 ms in left FDI, TI duration amounted to 30.5 ± 17.4 ms for right and 31.0 ± 25.2 ms for left FDI. Increase of onset latencies and durations of TI were positively correlated with the summed area of lesions of corpus callosum in representative mid- sagittal MRI slices. Significant correlations between TI onset latencies and duration on the one hand, and central motor conduction latencies along corticospinal tracts (CML) on the other hand, were not found. Conclusion: The present investigation indicates that measurement of TI elicited by fTMS seems to be a sensitive method for an assessment of demyelination and axonal degeneration within corpus callosum in MS patients.</p>"

This case was a 69-year-old man. whose initial symptoms consisted of headache and unsteadiness in walking. Neurological findings included mild ataxia of the left upper extremity and positive Romberg sign. T 2-weighted MRI showed high intensity areas in the posterior limb of the right internal capsule and white matter near the posterior horn of the right lateral ventricle. Although the headache improved, the unsteadiness was exacerbated and the patient became unable to keep standing. Psychiatric symptoms and left hemiparesis were added to the clinical picture, The following MRI proved expansion of the previous lesions and the diffusely enhanced lesion spreading into the contralateral side through the corpus callosum. Stereotaxic biopsy showed the perivascular accumulation of small lymphocytes and a large number of bizarre astrocytes. Primary brain malignant lyphoma was diagnosed and radiation therapy was carried out. However, he developed perforation of the intestinal tract and died. Autopsy findings revealed scattered and disseminated small lesions in the cerebral white matter and the corpus callosum. There were a large number of lipid-laden macrophages, no stainable myelin and preserved axis cylinders in those lesions. Thus, those were interpreted as demyelinting lesions. They were scattered and multiple. This case was radiologically characterised by the diffusely enhanced, expanding butterfly-shaped lesion in bilateral cerebral hemisphere through the corpus callosum, and pathologically proven to be acute demyelination associated with severe perivascular infiltration of inflammatory cells. Multiple sclerosis may mimic neoplastic processes as trans-callosal hyperplastic neuroimage on neuroimaging like the present case.</p>"
1409,2-s2.0-0032934804,Three dimensional MRI estimates of brain and spinal cord atrophy in multiple sclerosis,"<p>Objective - The association between brain atrophy and permanent functional deficits in multiple sclerosis and the temporal relation between atrophy and the clinical disease course have seldom been investigated. This study aims to determine the amount of infratentorial and supratentorial atrophy in patients by comparison with healthy controls, to establish the relation between atrophy and disability, and to derive the rates of volume loss in individual patients from their estimated disease durations. Methods - Three dimensional acquired MRI was performed on 20 relapsing-remitting and 20 secondary progressive multiple sclerosis patients and 10 control subjects. Volume data on infratentorial and supratentorial structures were obtained using the Cavalieri method of modern design stereology in combination with point counting. Corpus callosal sectional area and 'T2 lesion load' were also determined. Results - Significantly reduced infratentorial and cerebral white matter volumes and corpus callosal sectional areas occurred in all patients compared with controls (p = 0.0001-0.004). Mean estimates of volume loss in the cohort were -21%, -19%, -46%, and -12% for the brain stem, cerebellum, upper cervical cord and white matter, respectively, and -21% for the corpus callosal sectional area. Analysis of the amount of atrophy (volume differences between patients and controls) showed that upper cervical cord and cerebral white matter atrophy correlated with the expanded disability status scale (r = -0.37 and -0.37, p = 0.018-0.023) and the Scripps neurologic rating scale scores (r = +0.49 and +0.43, p = 0.002-0.007). There was no relation between estimated volume loss in the supratentorial and infratentorial compartments. The 'T2 lesion load' was associated with ventricular enlargement and corpus callosal atrophy (r = +0.50 and -0.55, p = 0.0003-0.0012). Infratentorial atrophy rates correlated with baseline exacerbation rates (r = -0.50 to -0.48, p = 0.0016-0.0021) and were higher in relapsing-remitting than secondary progressive patients (p = 0.009-0.02). Conclusions - Significant cerebral and spinal cord volume reductions occurred in both patient subgroups compared with controls. Functional correlates were found with estimated volume loss in the upper cervical cord and cerebral white matter. Particularly for infratentorial structures, estimated rates of atrophy were higher in relapsing-remitting than secondary progressive patients, suggesting that atrophy, perhaps mainly due to tract degeneration, begins early in multiple sclerosis and may relate predominantly to acute inflammatory events, with or without other gradual non-inflammatory processes later in the disease course.</p>"

This study has measured magnetisation transfer ratio (MTR), an index of tissue damage, of NAWM in 52 patients with primary progressive multiple sclerosis and 26 healthy controls. Absolute values of MTR were obtained from the genu of the corpus callosum and pons, and mean values were calculated from bilateral regions in the centrum semiovale, frontal white matter, parieto-occipital white matter and posterior limb of the internal capsule. The median MTR was lower in all regions in patients compared to controls. Median values (per cent units) were significantly lower in corpus callosum (39.73 vs 40.63; P = 0.01), frontal white matter (39.11 vs 39.59; P = 0.01) and centrum semiovale (37.21 vs 37.82; P &lt; 0.05). This study has demonstrated small but widespread decreases in MTR in NAWM in primary progressive multiple sclerosis supporting the hypothesis that there are intrinsic changes in NAWM which may contribute to disability in this patient group.</p>"
1411,2-s2.0-0032708656,Towards understanding multiple sclerosis: Intracerebral superantigen and activated blood immune cells,"<p>Intravenous (IV) injection of 10<sup>7</sup> splenocytes activated by Concanavalin A into syngeneic Lewis rats led to bilateral perivascular infiltrates (lasting 3 days; n = 14) around the ventricles and in the corpus callosum. Therefore, the pattern of multiple sclerosis (MS) plaques may have to do with the sites of cellular access to the brain. Women are considered more prone to develop relapses due to enhanced numbers of activated immune cells in the circulation depending on the estrous cycle. In rats injected intracerebrally (IC) with the superantigen SEA (staphylococcal enterotoxin A) variable numbers (1 to 16) of perivascular infiltrates per section of tissue were observed at the injection site (n = 20). IV transfer of activated splenocytes 3 days after IC SEA resulted in a strong dose and cell-load-dependent increase in the extent of the perivascular inflammation in the superantigen- challenged hemisphere (up to 35 infiltrates per slice of tissue; n = 50). This inflammation lasted up to 2 weeks. Taken together, our results are compatible with the concept that in MS relapses are precipitated by nonspecific immune stimuli activating peripheral T cells which, after crossing the blood-brain barrier, cause regional inflammation in a (myelin- )antigen-nonspecific but superantigen-specific manner. Oligoclonal bands may result from MHC II-specific clonal expansion of those B-cells that present the superantigen ('nonsense-antibodies'). In contrast, when the superantigen is not recognized by the immune system, chronic progression without relapses might result from the pure oligodendrocytopathic effects of the presumed neurotropic infectious agent. Our model may explain all features of MS including MHC associations. The therapeutic consequences comprise (1) immunosuppression, (2) superantigen vaccination to induce anergy against the relapse-inducing superantigen, and (3) anti-infectious therapy to eradicate the infectious source of MS.</p>"

1414,2-s2.0-0031794098,A role of nerve growth factor in oligodendrocyte growth and differentiation of EAE affected rats,"<p>We have previously shown that the level of nerve growth factor (NGF) undergoes significant changes in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with Multiple Sclerosis and in the brain of rats affected by Experimental Allergic Encephalomyelitis (AWEIGH). The functional significance of the endogenous disregulation of NGF is not known, though recent studies seem to suggest that NGF might be associated with the ability of oligodendrocytes (OLs) to produce and/or utilise NGF. The aim of the present study was therefore to investigate whether NGF is involved in the development and differentiation of cells of the subventricular zone (SVz) which arbors undifferentiated cells that can give rise to OLs. The results show that NGF injected into the brain of developing rats and of rats affected by AWEIGH is retrogradely transported from the SVz to the brain parenchyma. These findings suggest that during the early phase of brain development and during AWEIGH, NGF, along with other growth factors, is implicated in growth and/or differentiation of OLs and in protecting neuronal injury. The possible functional role of NGF in these events has been discussed.</p>"

Intravenous immunoglobulins have not been applied to patients with ADEM. This article describes a 22-year old woman who developed progressive paraparesis, ascending sensory dysfunction, and urinary incontinence one week after tonsillitis. Guillain-Barre syndrome was diagnosed initially, and intravenous immunoglobulins (0.4 g/kg daily) were begun. Symptoms deteriorated after the first and second applications, but after the third application the patient's sensory level declined. After the fourth application, the deterioration of symptoms stopped and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) abnormalities improved. Because of diffuse spinal cord swelling, intramedullary edema, and hyperintense white and grey matter lesions in the basal ganglia and the corpus callosum on MRI scans, the diagnosis was corrected to ADEM. It is concluded that initial administration of intravenous immunoglobulins might be of therapeutic value in patients with ADEM.</p>"
1416,2-s2.0-0031780754,Interhemispheric inhibition in patients with multiple sclerosis,"<p>Objectives: A single focal magnetic stimulus applied to the motor cortex of normal subjects can suppress ongoing voluntary electromyographic activity in ipsilateral small hand muscles. This inhibition is mediated from one motor cortex to the contralateral side via a transcallosal pathway. Methods: We have investigated transcallosal inhibition in 24 patients with definite multiple sclerosis (MS) and in 24 healthy volunteers. A focal magnetic stimulus was applied to the hand area of the motor cortex and the onset latency of the inhibition of the ongoing EMG activity of the ipsilateral first dorsal interosseus muscle was evaluated. Cortico-motor conduction time to the same muscle was revealed, using a magnetic stimulus over the contralateral motor cortex. The difference between these values was calculated as transcallosal conduction time. Cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans including sagittal T2-weighted images were performed in 18 patients. Results: The depth of inhibition (maximal inhibition as percentage of the baseline EMG) in the MS patients was comparable to normal values, but the transcallosal conduction time was significantly delayed (patients 17.2±6.4 ms; normal subjects 12.2±2.6 ms; P&lt;0.001). The duration of the inhibition was significantly prolonged in MS patients (patients 47.9±20.9 ms; normal subjects 38.9±10.1 ms; P=0.02). Transcallosal conduction time was delayed in 11 (46%) of 24 patients, compared with normal subjects. It exceeded the normal range (mean±2.5 SD) in one normal subject (specifity 96%). No correlation could be found between the size or extent of the lesions obtained from the MRI scan and the onset latency or the depth of the inhibition. Conclusions: We conclude that conduction over transcallosal connections is significantly slower in patients with MS. Copyright (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.</p>"
1417,2-s2.0-0031778902,Unenhanced and enhanced magnetic resonance imaging in the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis,"<p>Initial enthusiasm about the role of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis decreased substantially with the notion that (a) lesions of various pathological origins may resemble demyelinating plaques and (b) a dissemination of lesions throughout the brain is not unique for multiple sclerosis but may even be a 'normal' finding. Current experience still does not allow the identification of the aetiology of a single hyperintensity but has identified multiple features of multiple sclerosis related signal abnormalities which, in combination, provide rather high diagnostic accuracy. Useful characteristics include the distribution of lesions such as a strictly periventricular, infratentorial or juxtacortical location, and involvement of the corpus callosum. The presence of contrast enhancement in some but not all lesions - that is, evidence of both old and new lesions - provides additional diagnostic support. Improved instrumentation for imaging of the spine further extends the diagnostic options. Intramedullary signal abnormalities are detected with increased sensitivity and may disclose the presence of multiple lesions even in patients with an equivocal or a negative MRI of the brain. The high sensitivity to plaques and the opportunity to simultaneously rule out other gross morphological damage justifies the use of MRI as the primary diagnostic modality in the evaluation of multiple sclerosis.</p>"

A preliminary MRI study,"<p>In multiple sclerosis (MS), periventricular lesions produce atrophy of the corpus callosum (CC), as evidenced by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We investigated whether CC atrophy in relapsing-remitting MS patients is related to functional deficits. We compared 14 mildly disabled (mean Expanded Disability Status Scale score 2.7) relapsing-remitting MS patients with 14 age- and sex-matched controls. CC size was determined using sagittal T1-weighted MRI. The function of the CC was studied using a neuropsychological battery and neurophysiological evaluation based on visual stimulation using a divided visual field paradigm. The total area of the CC in patients (mean 5.3 cm<sup>2</sup>) was significantly (P = 0.002) smaller than in controls (mean 6.6 cm<sup>2</sup>). Patients showed left ear extinction using the dichotic listening test and impaired name learning, which was correlated with atrophy of the splenium. There were no differences in interhemispheric transfer time between patients and controls. Marked atrophy of the CC can be encountered in relapsing-remitting MS patients. The associated cerebral disconnection correlated with atrophy of expected regions of the CC, thus supporting topographical organization.</p>"

However, very few reports dealt with the spontaneously regulation of this cell population during experimental conditions. In this paper, we describe an increases in the proliferation activity in the SVZ during experimental allergic encephalomyelitis, a demyelinating disease widely used as an experimental model for human multiple sclerosis. Moreover, p75(LNGFR)- immunoreactive elements in the SVZ were larger in experimental allergic encephalomyelitis compared with control groups, and they also showed multiple and branched elongations. Finally, a selective uptake of <sup>125</sup>I-nerve growth factor was observed in the SVZ in neonatal rats, and positive elements migrated in the corpus callosum within a few days. These data indicate that cell populations in SVZ are regulated during inflammatory conditions and degenerative diseases involving oligodendrocytes and neurotrophins, including nerve growth factor, could participate in these phenomena.</p>"

We analyzed the number and location of white matter lesions (WML) and classified them in different regions. We also pointed out associated brain abnormalities, such as large hemispheric lesions. We found periventricular, paraventricular and subcortical WML in MS and paraventricular and subcortical WML in SLE; a confluent pattern of WML was seen only in MS; infratentorial WML were more frequent in MS; corpus callosum involvement was found only in MS; large hemispheric areas of increased signal representing strokes were present only in SLE. MRI shows different lesion patterns in MS and SLE and may play an important role in the differential diagnosis between these diseases.</p>"
1421,2-s2.0-0032211298,Changes of NGF presence in nonneuronal cells in response to experimental allergic encephalomyelitis in Lewis rats,"<p>We recently reported that the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients affected by multiple sclerosis (MS) and the brain tissues of rats with experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) contain elevated levels of nerve growth factor (NGF). In the present study, we demonstrate that astrocytes and oligodendrocytes particularly localized in the white matter, including corpus callosum, overexpress NGFmRNA and produce NGF protein in the CNS of EAE affected rats. These findings indicate that the increased NGF found in the brain of EAE rats and most probably also in the CSF of patients affected by MS is produced by activated glial cells. It is hypothesized that the enhanced production of NGF by glial cells is necessary to compensate for the effect of axonal and/or neuronal cell body injury occurring in EAE. The possible functional significance of these findings in demyelinating diseases is discussed.</p>"

Among them, the percentage with partial seizures (50%) was greater than that in the reference population. Results: In most of the patients with MS, plaques were lo-calized in the frontal region, associated with frontal and callosal atrophy, a frontal syndrome, and severe disability status (as assessed by a standard scale). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed numerous subcortical plaques. Seizures generally were well controlled with antiepileptic drugs (AEDs).

1423,2-s2.0-0031964427,"Oligodendrocytes utilize a matrix metalloproteinase, MMP-9, to extend processes along an astrocyte extracellular matrix","<p>Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), the key effectors of extracellular matrix remodeling, have been demonstrated to regulate the extension of neurites from neuronal cell bodies. In this report we have addressed the hypothesis that oligodendrocytes (OLs) may utilize a similar mechanism in extending their processes during the initial phase of myelination. Furthermore, given our previous findings linking protein kinase C (PKC) to the OL process outgrowth, we tested the postulate that this signal transduction pathway may regulate MMPs and thus the process outgrowth phenotype. We demonstrate that in response to pharmacologic activators of PKC, cultured human OLs augment their process extension with a concomitant increase in the activity of an MMP, MMP-9, as measured by gelatin zymography. Similarly, the phorbol ester-enhanced process extension and increased MMP-9 activity were both inhibited by calphostin C, a selective PKC inhibitor. Also, MMP inhibitors such as 1,10-phenanthroline and synthetic dipeptides that inactivate the MMP catalytic site negated the 4β-phorbol-12,13-dibutyrate (PDB)-mediated process extension, further supporting the key role of MMPs in process extension in vitro. Finally, the elevation of MMP-9 protein expression in the mouse corpus callosum, a tissue rich in OL and myelin, coincided with the previously documented temporal increase in myelination that occurs postnatally. Taken together, these data suggest that MMP-9 constitutes an important mediator of OL process outgrowth, and that this protease in turn can be regulated by PKC. The results are relevant not only to the initial steps of myelination during development, but also to the attempted remyelination that has been shown to occur in pathologic conditions such as MS.</p>"
1424,2-s2.0-0031654520,Neurological complications to vaccination against Japanese encephalitis,"<p>Japanese encephalitis (JE) vaccine has been used for childhood immunization programmes in Asia since the 1960s. Also, travellers from other parts of the world have been vaccinated before travelling to Asian countries. Some JE vaccines are produced from infected mouse brains and contain small amounts of myelin basic protein. Neurological side effects in larger vaccine trials in Asia have been reported in 1-2.3 per million vaccinees. Statens Serum Institut is the only distributor of JE vaccine in Denmark, delivering 384000 doses from 1983-96. In 1996, evaluation of initial symptoms and findings in 10 adult travellers from Denmark, who developed moderate-severe neurological symptoms within a few weeks of JE vaccination, was performed as well as follow-up magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and clinical neurological examination. Three patients initially had symptoms varying from severe encephalitis-like illness to paraesthesia, double vision or parkinsonian gait disturbance. MRI showed severe atrophy of the corpus callosum with altered signal intensity indicating gliosis in one patient, another patient had several hyperintense spots located periventricularly in the white matter, while a third patient had spots with increased signals in the pons, the right substantia nigra and the occipital region. Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) is a possible explanation for these MRI changes, although multiple sclerosis is an alternative diagnosis in one or two of the patients. Another three patients had long-lasting headache, concentration difficulty or intellectual reduction. One man had afebrile convulsions, another gait instability and depression and one parkinsonism. A woman developed myelitis. If these findings are due to JE vaccination the frequency of neurological reactions to the vaccine is considerably higher than previously reported and in the future any minor neurological complaints occurring shortly after vaccination should lead to neurological examination and acute MRI scan should be considered.</p>"
1425,2-s2.0-0031395233,Wegener's granulomatosis with cerebal vasculitis,"<p>Introduction. Wegener's granulomatosis (WG) is a systemic, noninfectious necrotizing granulomatous vasculitis characteristically involving the upper and lower respiratory tracts and kidneys, although there are limited forms without renal involvement. The cause is unknown, but the discovery of the antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (c-ANCA) in a high proportion of patients with WG suggest that immune mechanisms may be involved in the pathogenesis. As with other types of vasculitis, WG has developed in association with an antecedent viral infection. Viruses induce vasculitis by either direct vascular damage or by immunological mechanism. A diagnosis of WG is made if at least two of the following four criteria proposed by the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) are present: nasal or oral inflammation; abnormal findings on chest radiography; abnormal urinary sediments; granulomatous inflammation in biopsy specimens. Case report. A 18 year old man, with ACR classic criteria for WG, in stage of clinical remission, had headache, confusion and light coma and recovered to our hospital. The patient, subsequently, developed recurrent generalized seizures. On neurological examination, he had hemiparesis and hemianesthesia. Patient valuation included history, physical examination, chest radiography, complete blood cell count, routine blood and urine chemistry analisys, lumbar puncture with microbiologic studies. EEG showed bilateral epileptiform discharges. Was begun treatment with diazepam IV and phenobarbital. MRI performed in the acute phase showed bihemispheric cortico-subcortical cerebral lesions, hyperintense on T2-weighted images, with a mild mass effect on subarachnoid spaces. One month later, after corticosteroids and immunosuppressive therapy, follow-up MRI of the brain showed whole regression of pathologic findings. Discussion. Neurological complications have been estimated to occur in more than half of the patients with WG. Peripheral Nervous System involvement, typically peripheral neuropathy, is frequent (50%) and was classified as: mononeuropathy multiplex; distal symmetrical sensory or sensory-motor polyneuropathy; unclassified peripheral neuropathy. Mononeuropathy multiplex was most common and include acute or subacute asymmetrical involvement of peripheral nervous system. The nerves most affected are peroneal, tibial, median, radial and femoral nerves. Another 40% account for cranial neuropathies (optic, facial, trigeminal, acoustic) and external ophthalmoparesis. External ophtalmoparesis may clinically comes like an orbital pseudotumor. Cerebrovascular events and seizures were through related to WG. 10% of patients. Brain infarctions, subdural hematoma and subarachnoid hemorrhage were reported. Symptoms of large vessel involvement may included stroke-like presentation. Cerebrovascular events primarily affects middle age or elderly adults. Granulomatous inflammation of the meninges occurs rarely. Granulomatous noninfectious angiitis of the nervous system (GANS) is a rare, but distinctive angiopathy, that may be secondary to WG. GANS usually occurs in the active stage of WG and in younger patients. GANS is a disorder of parenchymal and leptomeningeal small arteries and veins. Non specific manifestations include weight loss, malaise, vomiting, visual loss, confusion and lethargy. Symptoms of predominant small vessel involvement may present as a diffuse or multifocal encephalopathy or as mass lesion. Symptoms and signs can be divided in: focal signs of cerebral dysfunction; diffuse or multifocal cerebral signs; signs of meningeal irritation; signs of increased intracranial pressure. Some patients had generalized convulsive seizures. Systematic symptoms, such as arthralgia, myalgia or skin rash, are absent. Although good responses to steroids or immunosuppressive therapy have been described, the outcome is generally fatal. Both male and female are affected equally, and the disease are found among all racial group. Histologic findings include necrosis of the vessel wall, that is infiltraded by lymphocytes, plasma cells, large mononuclear cells and giant cells. The vessel is usually, but no always, surrounded by granulomas composed of similar cells. These vasculitic lesions result in multiple foci of ischemic or hemorrhagic infarction secondary to vessel wall proliferation, luminal obliteration, thrombotic occlusion or rupture of necrotic vessel wall. The most common misdiagnoses are: multiple sclerosis; meningeal carcinomatosis; brain neoplasm; chronic meningitis. The characteristic but not pathognomonic findings of MRI are multiple, bilateral gray and white matter lesions, that may include the corpus callosum and capsular tracts. In our patient the response to steroid and immunosuppressive therapies have been satisfatory. Prompt diagnosis and treatment of GANS secondary to WG are essential. We consider MRI to be indispensable both to make a correct diagnosis in the acute stage and to evaluate the clinical outcome in the follow-up stage.</p>"

This study was conducted to determine the concentrations of mercury in seven different brain regions from deceased patients histologically confirmed with Alzheimer's disease or multiple sclerosis as compared to control subjects without known central nervous system and renal disorders. Brain mercury concentrations in all deceased subjects can arise from amalgam restorations, diet, and the working environment. Methods: Autopsy frozen specimens (control, Alzheimer's disease and multiple sclerosis) from seven brain regions, which included frontal cortex, temporal cortex, occipital cortex, putamen, hippocampus, corona radiata and corpus callosum were assayed for the concentrations of selenium using instrumental neutron activation analysis and mercury using radiochemical neutron activation analysis. Results: We found that the concentrations of mercury and the mercury/selenium molar ratios were significantly lower in the hippocampi of multiple sclerosis patients as compared to aged-matched controls. However, no statistically significant differences were detected for the concentrations of mercury and the mercury/selenium molar ratios for the remaining six brain regions among these groups. Conclusions: Since brain mercury concentrations from deceased subjects with either Alzheimer's disease or multiple sclerosis are not significantly higher than controls, the present study provides no scientific support that mercury plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of these neurologic disorders.</p>"

Profiles of curvatures were measured showing that this surface was close to a minimal one, especially at the genu and near the splenium. To assess the effect of a white matter pathology on these geometrical features, the same measurements were performed in an extra group of nine patients with definite multiple sclerosis. The hypothesis of curvatures profiles parallelism for the two groups could be rejected at the 0.05 confidence level for the mean curvatures but not for the Gaussian ones.

He noticed a moderate dysarthria after a high grade fever in February of 1995; however, two weeks later his symptom disappeared completely. Three months later, he noticed the dysarthria again and he was referred to our hospital for further examination. General physical findings on admission revealed a dark skin color, pigmentation of gingivae and reduced body hair. Neurologically ha was normal except for a moderate ataxic dysarthria. Cranial T2-weighted MRI showed multiple high intensity lesions in the subcortical while matter of frontal lobe, bilateral peritrigonal white matter, splenium of the corpus callosum and bilateral cerebellar white matter. Only cerebellar lesions responsible for his symptom were enhanced on MRI after gadolinium administration. Initially we diagnosed him with multiple sclerosis (MS) based upon the clinical course and MRI findings, and then started corticosteroid treatment. His dysarthria was slightly improved after the treatment and bilateral gadolinium-enhanced lesions of cerebellar white matter on MRI disappeared. Multimodality evoked potentials such as short latency somatosensory evoked potentials, brainstem auditory evoked potentials and pattern-reversal visual evoked potentials, disclosed a prolonged central conduction time associated with bilaterally symmetric individual interpeak latencies. These findings, which supported diffuse and bilateral subclinical demyelinating lesions in the central nervous system, were unusual for MS; therefore his plasma very-long-chain fatty acids (VLCFA) were assayed for ALD. Finally, he was diagnosed with adult type ALD because of the high ratio of C26: 0/C22: 0 (0.075; normal &lt;0.033). It is very difficult to clinically distinguish the early stage of adult type ALD especially in patients like this from MS. Therefore it is useful and important to evaluate not only the level of plasma VLCFA, but also to evaluate multimodality evoked potentials.</p>"

Peyser and C. M. Poser, 1986; S. M. Rao, 1986) have suggested that multiple sclerosis (MS) results in cognitive impairment in learning and memory, abstract reasoning, information-processing efficiency, and often visual-spatial ability. MS patients may undergo idiosyncratic cognitive changes dependent on the site of white matter lesions. In the present study, researchers used cluster analysis on the neuropsychological data from a group of mildly disabled relapsing-remitting MS patients (n = 177) and a well-matched control group (n = 89). In those MS patients identified with unequivocal cognitive impairment, the majority clustered into groups with a specific deficit in 1 or 2 areas of cognitive functioning, with normal performance in others. On magnetic resonance imaging, an association Was obtained between 2 lesion sites and 2 cognitive tests. Impairment in visual-spatial ability, as assessed by the Benton Visual Retention Test, was associated with lesions in the genu of the corpus callosum (CC) and with more lesions throughout the CC. Impaired performance on Paired Associates, a test of learning and memory, was associated with a lesion in the deep white matter of the left parietal lobe. The findings support the hypothesis that MS results in multiple patterns of cognitive impairment that depend on the individual placement of white matter lesions.</p>"

White matter hyperintensities in brain were found in 270 of them. The most frequently they were found in periventricular white matter (in 100% of cases), in subcortical localization (52.2%) and in the corpus callosum (44.4%). MR examination allows to estimate the activity of the disease on the basis of the presence of oedema around the plaques and their contrast enhancement with gadopentetate dimeglumine (Gd-DTPA). 17.8% of all cases showed the signs of the acute phase of MS. About one-third of all cases were accompanied by cortical brain atrophy (the most often seen in the frontal lobes), subcortical brain atrophy was less frequent (one-sixth). In about two-third of all cases the corpus callosum atrophy was found. The analysis of follow-up MR examinations of 83 patients taking part in a double-blind placebo-controlled trial of a new immunosupressive drug cladribine showed that patients from the placebo group were more compliant to any changes of the plaques. Decrease of the plaques size was found mainly in women. No correlation between the patients age and the plaques changes was established.</p>"
1435,2-s2.0-0030474563,A comparison of the sensitivity of different sequences in identifying plaques in multiple sclerosis,"<p>Magnetic resonance is the investigation of choice in patients with multiple sclerosis. This paper compares the sensitivity of currently used MR sequences to determine those offering the best display of the inflammatory plaques characterizing multiple sclerosis. We investigated 71 patients with a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis based on the Poser Committee diagnostic criteria. All patients underwent MR examination including a proton density (PD) and T2-weighted SE sequence, a T2-weighted TSE sequence and an IR sequence. The clear display of demyelinating lesions was scored on the basis of subjective and objective criteria. Subjectively, plaque display was satisfactory in most cases with particularly high scores in the periventricular white matter, while lower scores were given to lesions in the cerebellum and brainstem. Plaque located in the corpus callosum had an intermediate score and was poorly displayed in several cases. Assessing the different lesions in relation to sequence used, T2-weighted SE sequences had the best score. The three sequences had the same score in terms of single lesion location in the deep and periventricular white matter, while PD was the best sequence in the corpus callosum. Less satisfactory images were obtained in the posterior cranial fossa, especially with T2-weighted TSE and PD-weighted SE sequences. This was mainly due to the presence of CSF flow and pulsation artifacts and the small size of the lesions in this location. Subsequent objective assessment was based on the intrinsic contract of each sequence. In absolute terms, the sequence with greatest intrinsic contrast, especially for plaques, was the T2-weighted TSE sequence. The sole exception was the contrast between plaque and CSF in which the PD sequence was more reliable. The objective findings thus appeared to contradict the subjective assessment. Whereas the sequence with most intrinsic contrast was the T2-weighted TSE image, the T2-weighted SE sequences scored highest on subjective assessment, suggesting that intrinsic image contrast is not the main factor determining clear display of demyelinating lesions. For example, factors such as the blurring effect of point spread function and the residual magnetisation transfer of surrounding tissues may attenuate the clarity of lesion display. In conclusion, PD and T2-weighted SE sequences offer the best visualization of demyelinating lesions in multiple sclerosis, displaying several tissue parameters in one acquisition with satisfactory intrinsic contrast.</p>"

Cultures were derived from both the corpus callosum (CC) and superior frontal gyrus (SFG). Cultured microglia phagocytosed latex beads, were reactive for DiI-acetylated low density lipoprotein, were immunoreactive for CD68 and major histocompatibility complex II markers, and were not immunoreactive for fibroblast, astrocyte, or oligodendrocyte markers. Cultured astrocytes included fibrous and protoplasmic types, were immunoreactive for GFAP, and were not immunoreactive for fibroblast, microglia, or oligodendrocyte markers. Cultured oligodendrocytes were poorly adherent, were slow to develop, were immunoreactive for galactocerebroside, and were not immunoreactive for fibroblast, microglia, or astrocyte markers. Because they are readily manipulated under controlled experimental conditions, and because they permit immediate access to individual cells and sets of cells from patients who have actually suffered the disease, these cultures may provide an important new tool for unravelling the etiology and pathogenesis of human CNS disorders.</p>"

Initially, the patient's visual recognition of object form was severely disturbed at the perceptual stage, in association with left-sided ideomotor apraxia and agraphia. Magnetic resonance imaging showed large white matter lesions in the bilateral frontal and occipital lobes, the latter extending to the occipitotemporal junction, and widespread corpus callosum lesions. Over the course of one year follow-up, neuropsychological examinations indicated that the patient's visual recognition defects occurred not only at the early substage of form perception, but also at the stage of reproducing the shape of objects from visual memory store. The present case suggests that neural connections between the striate cortex and occipitotemporal visual areas are crucial for both the perceptual and associative stages of visual object recognition.</p>"
1439,2-s2.0-0029399385,Reversal of alexia in multiple sclerosis by weak electromagnetic fields,"<p>The Occurrence of cognitive deficits in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) has been recognized since 1877 when Charcot first observed enfeeblement of memory"" in his patients. Cognitive deficits have been reported in almost 50% of patients with a relapsing-remitting course and in a significantly higher percentage of patients with a chronic progressive course leading to intellectual disability which is often severe enough to preclude employment. MS is considered a form of subcortical dementia and the occurrence of classical cortical disorders such as aphasia, agnosia and apraxia is reported to be rare in the disease. However, in my experience alexia, a reading impairment unrelated to visual acuity or visual field defects, is common in patients with MS. Recently, I reported that treatment with picotesla range electromagnetic fields (EMFs) is an efficacious modality in the management of both the motor and cognitive symptoms of MS. Three patients with MS who developed alexia as a manifestation of the disease are presented. In all patients the alexia was reversed several months after they began treatment with EMFs. Since alexia usually reflects a disconnection syndrome whereby lesions involving the left visual cortex and the splenium of the corpus callosum disconnect language association areas from visual association areas, it is suggested that reversal of the alexia in these patients by EMFs was related to improved interhemispheric transcallosal transmission of visual information. In addition, it is conceivable that changes in the metabolism of monoamines, which are involved in visual information processing and reading comprehension, may have been important in causing reversal of the alexia. This report further supports the unique efficacy of this treatment modality in reversing specific cognitive deficits in MS. © 1995 Informa UK Ltd All rights reserved: reproduction in whole or part not permitted.</p>"
1440,2-s2.0-0029076232,The neuropsychiatry of multiple sclerosis,"<p>Objective: This article examines the cognitive and psychiatric features of multiple sclerosis. MS can manifest as a neuropsychiatric disturbance even in the absence of physical disabilities. Method: Two MS patients with predominant behavioral symptoms are described, and the literature is reviewed. Results: The first patient had an interhemispheric disconnection syndrome, and the second patient had cognitive fatigue and depression. Other patients have slowed information processing speed, memory retrieval difficulty, frontal-executive dysfunction, and visuospatial difficulty. Conclusions: MS results in specific cognitive deficits and mood disorders. These two patients had organic mental disorders from cerebral demyelination particularly affecting the corpus callosum. Other patients have neuropsychiatric symptoms from extensive demyelination of prefrontal- subcortical circuits. Evaluation and management strategies are discussed.</p>"
1441,2-s2.0-0029019620,MR findings in adult-onset adrenoleukodystrophy,"<p>PURPOSE: To describe the MR findings of brain and spinal cord in adult- onset adrenoleukodystrophy. METHODS: One hundred sixty-four adult patients ranging from 19 to 74 years of age (119 men and 45 women) with clinically and biochemically proved adrenoleukodystrophy underwent MR of the brain. In 30 patients the spinal cord also was evaluated with MR. RESULTS: The brain MR findings were abnormal in 54 of 119 males and in 9 of 45 female heterozygotes and consisted of varying degrees of demyelination of the cerebral white matter in 40 patients, corpus callosum in 25 patients, corticospinal tracts in 46 patients, visual tracts in 31 patients, and auditory tracts in 18 patients. The thoracic spinal cord showed diffuse atrophy in 18 of 20 men and in 8 of 10 women. CONCLUSION: It is important to recognize the MR findings of adult-onset adrenoleukodystrophy, because not uncommonly the clinical and MR findings of adrenoleukodystrophy are misdiagnosed as multiple sclerosis, olivopontocerebellar or spinocerebellar atrophy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or dementia. Analysis of the MR findings and correlation of the clinical findings has permitted a tentative subdivision of adult-onset adrenoleukodystrophy population into four subtypes that appear to differ in respect to prognosis and possibly pathogenesis. MR evaluation of the brain in adrenoleukodystrophy also is helpful in patient selection for experimental therapy, which is most effective if offered in the early stage of the disease.</p>"

The method utilized involved the exogenous application of physiologic, very weak magnetic fields to the brain by Sandyk, Anninos, Derpapas and Tsagas. The magnetic device produced a magnetic field ranging from about 5 x 10(-8) gauss to about 2.5 x 10(-7) gauss at frequencies of 2 to 7 Hertz. The wave form was sinusoidal and the device was positioned about the posterior portion of the corpus callosum most specifically to influence the pineal gland. Direct correlation of melatonin production with magnetic field stimulation was established. Amelioration or palliation of the neurological conditions was observed over an extended period of time in most cases. It appeared that a resonance situation was established between the magnetic field and melatonin which could be explained with Jacobson Resonance. These studies begin to point to the explanation of the mechanism of interaction between non-ionizing electromagnetic radiation and biological systems. Furthermore, the evaluation of the pineal gland as an magneto-sensitive gland may help us understand fundamental conditions in magneto-receptors of biological systems in terms of their piezoelectric nature.</p>"
1443,2-s2.0-0028214984,Dementia in two histologically confirmed cases of multiple sclerosis: One case with isolated dementia and one case associated with psychiatric symptoms,"<p>During the past 10 years, considerable attention has been devoted to cognitive impairment in multiple sclerosis. Occasionally this impairment may be so severe that multiple sclerosis presents as a dementia associated with only minor neurological signs and symptoms. The cases of two women affected by multiple sclerosis who presented with a pure dementia are reported. In the first patient, a progressive apragmatic behavioural disturbance with reduced short term memory and learning abilities were the main clinical features. Neuropathological examination of the brain disclosed numerous plaques in the periventricular white matter, with severe atrophy of the corpus callosum. Plaques were also seen in the white matter of both hippocampus and in the columns of the fornix. The impairment of short term memory could be linked to these lesions. Behavioural changes were probably related to the bilateral lesions of the long associative bundles that disconnected the frontal lobes from other parts of the cerebral hemispheres. In the second patient, visual hallucinations were associated with cognitive dysfunction. MRI showed large plaques in the white matter of both left frontal and temporal lobes. Smaller plaques were also present in the periventricular white matter of the occipital lobes, the nature of which were confirmed by a stereotactic biopsy.</p>"
1444,2-s2.0-0028131646,Distributional patterns of multiple sclerosis brain lesions: Magnetic resonance imaging-clinical correlation,"<p>Forty-one patients with multiple sclerosis were studied with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and a battery of neuropsychological tests to determine the pattern of lobar distribution of lesions in the relapsing- progressive and relapsing-remitting forms of the disease. Correlation of lesions with the patient's cognitive and emotional dysfunction was also obtained. The results of this study indicate that patients with relapsing- progressive multiple sclerosis are characterized by the large or coalescent lesions located predominantly in the periventricular area. These lesions were more frequently found in the parietooccipital areas and were accompanied by significant cognitive dysfunction and severe personality changes. The patients with relapsing-remitting disease, however, were characterized by punctiform or small discrete lesions predominantly located in the intermediate and subcortical areas. These lesions were more frequently seen in the parietooccipital regions and the patients had significantly less severe cognitive and emotional involvement than did the patients with relapsing-progressive disease. Recognition of these patterns was easily accomplished by MRI. In this investigation MRI studies were utilized as an index of the pathological changes occurring at one point in time in the evaluation of the disease. Only repeated MRI studies and continuous clinical observation can establish the final diagnosis.</p>"

Magnetic resonance (MRT) (0.5 T; T2‐weighted sequence) of the brain was analysed by measuring the ventricular brain ratio (VBR), the area of the corpus callosum (CC) and the extension of hyperintense lesions of the brainstem, the temporal lobes and the brain at all. Six of 25 (24%) of these moderately disabled patients (mean Extended Disability Score (EDSS) 3.3) were diagnosed to suffer from depressive mood disorder (major depression or dysthymia); 2 were demented. In correlation analysis, depression was unrelated to age, gender, duration of illness, status of disability (EDSS) or the results of cognitive assessment. No relationship between the depression scores and the different MRT measures could be identified. The presence or absence of gadolinium enhancement was also uncorrelated to depressive symptoms. Fatigue as measured by the Fatigue Severity Scale was unrelated to depression or subcortical brain atrophy (increased VBR) but significantly correlated to the area of hyperintense MRT changes in brainstem and midbrain. Cognitive impairment (decreased SIDAM scores) was correlated to the total area of hyperintense MRT changes of the brain parenchyma. The type of clinical course (relapsing‐remitting vs chronic progredient) was not found to influence the affective or cognitive state in our MS patient's sample. Copyright © 1994, Wiley Blackwell.

We observed a 26 year-old female who had for four months been showing memory and language disturbances, abulia, mood changes. Mild gait ataxia, brisk tendon reflexes at the four limbs, milk weakness of the left leg and bilateral paleness of temporal portion of the optic disk were present at the neurological examination. The patient was anosognosic. She showed disturbances of short and long term memory, anomia, phonemic paraphasias, constructional apraxia, spatial disorientation. MR brain scan showed marked cortical and deep atrophy. Also corpus callosum was atrophic. Multiple, confluent areas of high signal intensity in T2-weighted images were also appreciable in the white matter of centrum semiovale bilaterally, both in periventricular and subcortical location. Another lesion was present in the left middle cerebellar peduncle. HM-PAO SPECT brain scan revealed cortical hypoperfusion in the left frontal and parietal lobes. VEPs, BAEPs and MEPs gave pathological results. Oligoclonal IgG banding and intrathecal IgG synthesis resulted from CSF analysis. According to Poser's criteria the patient was diagnosed as having definite MS (laboratory-supported definite MS B2). In MS patients, cognitive disorders have been found to be associated with atrophy of the corpus callosum, widespread periventricular lesions and derangements of cortical perfusion assessed by SPECT. The observed finding of cortical hypoperfusion in the frontal lobe is in line with previous reports. In this case, the discrepancy between the severe mental impairment and the mild physical disability could be explained by the fact that brainstem and, probably, spinal cord structures were somewhat spared by the demyelinating process.</p>"

1451,2-s2.0-0027227452,Inborn errors and demyelination: MRI and the diagnosis of white matter disease,"<p>The progress and extent of myelination can be assessed using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Myelination is delayed or diminished in several inherited metabolic abnormalities presenting in early life. Only minimal myelination of the CNS occurs in Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease. Dysmyelination tends to produce fairly symmetrical lesions affecting white matter. In many mitochondrial enzyme and some lysosomal defects, the grey matter is also involved. The appearances and in particular the distribution on MRI and/or CT are characteristic in some conditions and the diagnosis is limited in others. Demyelination due to inflammatory disorders typically causes multifocal white matter lesions, recurrent in multiple sclerosis, monophasic in acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, extending in progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy and classically involving the pons or corpus callosum in myelinolysis. Hypoxic ischaemic lesions may be metabolically induced and simulate primary demyelinating disorders. Mitochondrial enzyme defects in particular may present with stroke-like appearances. In many of these conditions, diagnosis is biochemical, but imaging has a significant role in suggesting the diagnosis, and documenting progression, response to therapy or complications. © 1993 SSIEM and Kluwer Academic Publishers.</p>"
1452,2-s2.0-0027439067,Functional and Magnetic Resonance Imaging Correlates of Callosal Involvement in Multiple Sclerosis,"<p>To investigate functional and anatomical features of callosal involvement in multiple sclerosis (MS), performances of 90 patients with definite MS and 25 matched normal control subjects were compared on three tasks exploring interhemispheric transfer of auditory, sensory, and motor information: a verbal dichotic listening task, a crossed tactile finger localization task, and an alternate finger tapping task. Each patient also underwent a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan (1) to appreciate the extent of whitematter changes by a semiquantitative evaluation of hemispheric brain MRI hyperintensities and (2) to measure the degree of total and regional callosal atrophy using an automatized method of partition of the midsagittal callosal area. Interhemispheric transfer and/or integration was impaired in patients with MS for all modalities explored and proportional to both degree of callosal atrophy and diffusion of white-matter lesions. Moreover, in good agreement with data obtained from partial commissurotomy studies, performance on each functional task was predominantly associated with atrophy of one part of the callosum, namely left-ear dichotic suppression with the posterior callosal region, alternate finger tapping with the anterior region, and cross-localization with midanterior and posterior regions. Finally, a subgroup of patients without MRI white-matter hyperintensities also showed significant impairment of callosal function and relative atrophy of the callosum. These findings suggest the potential clinical value of callosal involvement in MS and the usefulness of MS as a model of interhemispheric disconnection. © 1993, American Medical Association.

The performance on one or more neuropsychological tests was abnormal in 47% of the 64 patients who completed the entire neuropsychological battery; the cognitive impairment was mild in 14 (22%) and severe in 16 (25%). Performance on any single neuropsychological test was unrelated to clinical parameters (age, duration of the disease, disability). The neuropsychological performance of relapsing-remitting patients was better than in patients with a chronic-progressive disease. The mean scores for almost all the neuropsychological tests were significantly lower in patients with severe ventricular dilatation and corpus callosum atrophy than in patients in whom these structures were little affected. Mean scores for WMS, performance Intelligence Quotient (IQ), total IQ and Token Test (TT) were also significantly correlated with the widening of cortical sulci and total lesional scores.

Second, the correlation of certain cognitive deficit patterns with important magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) variables such as total lesion area, size of the corpus callosum and specific lesion location is outlined in detail. Third, some recommendations are made with regard to general rehabilitation principles such as restitution, compensation and adaptation as well as for special rehabilitation techniques including cognitive retraining of basic deficits and/or training of activities of daily living.

According to the generally held view MHC class II expression is rather low in the normal brain with the exception of the white matter. In the present study, HLA-DR expression was examined immunocytochemically in different brain areas obtained from three autopsy cases with short post-mortem times (i.e. 6 h). Based on standard histological evaluation, the brain areas studied appeared as histologically normal tissue. In all brain areas there was a strong constitutive HLA-DR expression on ramified microglia. The number of HLA-DR-immunoreactive microglia was strongest in the white matter (the corpus callosum and the capsula interna for example). The border zone between white matter and grey matter, however, revealed a sharp contrast between a high density of HLA-DR-immunoreactive microglia in the white matter and a rather low number in the grey matter. In the grey matter, HLA-DR-immunoreactive microglia were much less frequent than in the white matter and more pronounced on perivascular cells. The staining and distribution pattern of HLA-DR-immunoreactive microglia was confirmed by immunocytochemistry with a panel of different anti-HLA-DR monoclonal antibodies as well as by quantitative analysis of the immunostaining. Unlike the HLA-DR immunoreactivity, HLA-ABC immunoreactivity (detecting MHC class I antigens) was confined to endothelia and not observed on microglia. In the choroid plexus stromal macrophages expressed both class I and II antigens (i.e. at a location which could provide the peripheral immune system access to CNS antigens). Constitutive HLA-DR expression by microglia qualifies them as the main resident antigen-presenting cell of the brain. The pronounced overall HLA-DR expression by resting microglia questions a central dogma of the brain as an immune-privileged site and further points to the key role of the microglia in brain immune surveillance. © 1993.</p>"

The purpose of this study was to compare the sensitivity of a rapid volume gradient echo technique [3D magnetization prepared rapid acquisition gradient echo (MP RAGE)] in identifying multiple sclerosis (MS) plaques with a conventional T2-weighted spin echo (SE) sequence. Ten patients with clinical MS were evaluated. Patients underwent a routine examination consisting of an axial T2-weighted SE sequence (2, 500, 22/90) and a coronal 3D MP RAGE, 10/4/10, acquired as 128 two mm partitions. In six patients, area measurements of 22 plaques were determined on both the axial T2-weighted SE examinations and the axial reformatted MP RAGE examinations. The overall number of plaques utilizing each technique was approximately the same. One hundred twenty-two plaques were visualized for the 3D MP RAGE sequence, and 128 plaques for the T2-weighted SE sequence. There were differences in detection of plaques in different regions, with plaques in gray matter better demonstrated utilizing the conventional T2-weighted SE sequence. Plaques in the corpus callosum, pons, and brachia pontis were better demonstrated utilizing 3D MP RAGE. No significant difference was found between the areas measured on the MP RAGE sequence and on the T2- weighted SE sequence. Three-dimensional MP RAGE provides a sensitive and complementary method to conventional T2-weighted SE sequences in the evaluation of patients with MS. © 1992 Raven Press, Ltd., New York.</p>"
1466,2-s2.0-0026719190,Neuropsychological and structural brain lesions in multiple sclerosis: A regional analysis,"<p>Quantified lesion scores derived from MRI correlate significantly with neuropsychological testing in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). Variables used to reflect disease severity include total lesion area (TLA), ventricular-brain ratio, and size of the corpus callosum. We used these general measures of cerebral lesion involvement as well as specific ratings of lesion involvement by frontal, temporal, and parieto-occipital regions to quantify the topographic distribution of lesions and consequent effects upon cognitive function. Lesions were heavily distributed in the parieto-occipital regions bilaterally. Neuropsychological tests were highly related to all generalized measures of cerebral involvement, with TLA being the best predictor of neuropsychological deficit. Mean TLA for the cognitively impaired group was 28.30 cm<sup>2</sup> versus 7.41 cm<sup>2</sup> for the cognitively intact group (p &lt; 0.0001). Multiple regression analyses revealed that left frontal lobe involvement best predicted impaired abstract problem solving, memory, and word fluency. Left parieto-occipital lesion involvement best predicted deficits in verbal learning and complex visual-integrative skills. Analysis of regional cerebral lesion load may assist in understanding the particular pattern and course of cognitive deficits in MS. © 1992 American Academy of Neurology.</p>"

Lesion area, regardless of distribution, correlated with performance on the vast majority of neuropsychological procedures.

However, patients with severe cognitive impairment had greater lesion area, regardless of location, and had significant atrophy of the corpus callosum compared with the other two groups. These results suggest that severe atrophy of the corpus callosum reflects global disease and provides a relatively focal morphological marker of severe cognitive impairment in MS.</p>"
1469,2-s2.0-0026509935,"Epidemiology of alexithymia: Evaluation, quantitative and clinical data","<p>Alexithymia is a concept created by Sifneos in 1972 to describe a disturbance in affective and cognitive functions characterised by an inability to find words to describe feelings or emotions. The term 'alexithymia' is derived from the Greek and means 'no words for feelings'. The salient clinical features of alexithymia include difficulties recognizing and verbalizing feelings, endless description of physical symptoms instead of emotions, concrete speech and thougt closely tied to external events, paucity of fantasy life. Precisely, alexithymia is an inability to associate one's visual image, thoughts and fantasies with a specific emotional state. For Sifneos, 'emotions' and 'feelings' are different facts. He differentiates 'visceral emotions' (biologic side of the affect and lying in structures of the limbic system as the hippocampus and the amygdaloid complex) and 'feelings emotions' (psychologic side of the affect). For him, animals experience 'visceral emotion', but only human experience 'feeling emotions'. Alexithymia is regarded as one of several possible risk factors that seem to increase the susceptibility to physical disease. Alexithymia describes some psychological features which has been initially described by Marty and Psychosomatic French School: a specific cognitive style characterized by a lack of absence of fantasies and a preoccupation with the minute details of external events ('pensee operatoire'). Alexithymia is a difficult concept to operationalize and only few instruments are sufficiently reliable and valid. Several scales are used to measure alexithymia but only the Beth Israel Questionnaire (BIQ) and the Toronto Alexithymie Scale (TAS) can be regarded as having sufficient psychometric properties. The first questionnaire, the BIQ - a scale created by Sifneos -, is the most widely used instrument which is a 17-items forced-choise questionnaire completed by the interviewer. The TAS is a 26-items self-report measure rated on a five-point Likert scale. The Shalling Sifneos Psychosomatic Scale (SSPS) and the M.M.P.I Alexithymia Scale lack of validation and reliability. Furthermore the SSPS and the MMPI AS show little or no relation with BIQ or with TAS, thus limiting the comparability and generalizability of results from the studies that use them. The TAS is considered as internally consistent and to have a stable, replicable factor structure. Other measures as content analysis test, projective test (Rorschach, T.AT., SAT9) or others self-assessment questionnaires are not frequently used. Alexithymia was first studied in classical psychosomatic or somatic disorders as asthma, chronic bronchitis, chronic pain, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, obesity, ulcerative colitis, irritable bowel syndrome... However alexythimic features are also noticed in patients with substance abuse disorders (alcoholism, drug addiction), posttraumatic stress disorders, character neuroses, masked depressions, sexual perversions, somatoform disorders and in some others psychiatric disorders, namely affective disorders. So alexithymia could not be regarded as specific of individuals with a diagnosis of a 'psychosomatic disease' all the more as all psychosomatic patients do not reveal alexithymia which is also noticed in other disorders.</p>"
1470,2-s2.0-0026505152,Multiple sclerosis: The impact of MR imaging,"<p>MR imaging has had a significant impact on the understanding of multiple sclerosis. The procedure now plays an important role in initial diagnostic workup, replacing some other radiologic and paraclinical tests and often confirming clinically suggested locations of lesions. It also has contributed greatly to the understanding of the natural history of this disease, allowing objective assessment of disease load, detection of asymptomatic lesions, and differentiation between acute and chronic lesions. MR imaging is highly sensitive to inflammation and demyelination caused by multiple sclerosis, and although there is a long differential diagnosis for some of the MR findings, increasing experience has defined a number of relatively specific criteria for multiple sclerosis. Recent advances may allow faster imaging and highly objective lesion quantification, which will aid in therapeutic trials.</p>"

To reinvestigate this issue, 26 patients satisfying criteria for definite multiple sclerosis were proposed 3 tasks aimed at evaluating interhermispheric function: a dichotic listening task, a motor finger-tapping task and a sensory transfer task. Performance at these tasks suggested impaired callosal function in MS patients, compared to normal controls. Callosal morphology was assessed on midsagittal MRI sections using a digitalised method of partition of the callosal area into 6 subregions and automatized surface measurements. Results of correlations between task performance and callosal areas showed a significant correlation between total callosal atrophy and severity of interhemispheric impairment on each functional task. Moreover, impaired motor transfer was specifically related to atrophy of the anterior callosal regions. These results suggest that MS patients may constitute a suitable population to studying interhemispheric transfer of information through the callosal commissure and that this approach may be useful in the clinical management of MS patients.</p>"
1472,2-s2.0-0026487739,Relationship between corpus callosum atrophy and cerebral metabolic asymmetries in multiple sclerosis,"<p>Corpus callosum (CC) atrophy by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a common finding in multiple sclerosis (MS). In order to examine the relationship between CC atrophy and cortical brain metabolism, we compared the cerebral metabolic rates for glucose (CMRglc), measured by positron emission tomography (PET), of 8 MS patients with evidence of CC atrophy on midsagittal MRI, 8 MS patients without CC atrophy and 10 healthy controls. Results showed no significant differences in supratentorial CMRglc absolute values between the three groups, although a slight metabolic reduction was observed in both MS groups compared with normal controls. By contrast, only patients with CC atrophy showed greater directional metabolic asymmetry than normals, the left frontal, temporal and parietal association cortices being significantly lower than the right. Predominant left hemispheric metabolic reductions were not accompanied by a corresponding left-sided predominance in the extent of MRI-detected demyelinating lesions. Therefore our data suggest that CC atrophy interfers more with left than with right metabolic function. © 1992.</p>"
1473,2-s2.0-0025871897,Migration of xenogenic astrocytes in myelinated tracts: a novel probe for immune responses in white matter,"<p>Experimental brain transplantation allows the study of the development of the immune response against brain antigens within the brain itself. This laboratory has developed a transplantation model in which rabbit embryo brain fragments are placed in the brains of newborn mice. The migration of xenogenic astrocytes is traced by a monoclonal antibody which combines with donor but not host glial fibrillary acidic protein. In the first 4 weeks after transplantation, the donor astrocytes successfully migrate, often within myelinated tracts. Following this period, T cells make their apperance and xenogenic astrocytes disappear by 10 weeks. The propensity for clearly identified foreign astrocytes to migrate in myelinated tracts coupled with a well-defined time course of host-vs-graft interaction suggested that the model could be used to study the immune response in white matter. The studies reported here provide sequential examples of the relationship between migration by foreign astrocytes in myelinated tracts and the development of the host immune response. Extensive migration in white matter tracts was first observed in the absence of any T cell response. Subsequently T cells were found at the transplantation site. Finally Ia was found to be expressed on blood vessels and microglia were strongly reactive in white matter that contained T cells but no foreign astrocytes. These observations support the suggestion that the model can be used to more precisely define cellular immune events that occur within white matter. © 1991 Springer-Verlag.</p>"

Cognition was normal in 4 and MR scan in 2 of them. In the 2 others, there were mild modifications of the white matter. One patient suffered of visual retention disturbances with abnormalities of the white matter in MR scan. In the last, cognitive decline was observed; MR scan showed atrophy of cortex and corpus callosum and periventricular high signal areas. Comparison with leukoaraiosis in healthy adults and with multiple sclerosis suggests that there is probably a relationship between cognition and extension of brain MR abnormalities. Time of appearance and frequency of cognitive dysfunction might be explained by the natural history of each of these diseases.</p>"

Measures of both anterior and posterior CC areas were obtained in patients with MS as well as in eighteen age and sex matched healthy controls. MRI scans were additionally analyzed for each patient in order to evaluate the extent of demyelinating lesions in both periventricular and subcortical areas. Patients with MS exhibited a significant decrease in both the anterior and posterior CC areas compared with normal subjects. The results of statistical analysis showed that, even when the effect of demyelinating lesions was taken into account within a regression equation, the atrophy of anterior CC area strongly affected the performance on verbal fluency task. These data emphasize the importance of the anterior CC area for the interhemispheric transfer of cognitive information associated with verbal fluency. © 1991, Masson Italia Periodici S.r.l..

They prospectively evaluated 42 patients with MS and 127 control patients with other PWDs. Ninety-three percent of the MS patients demonstrated confluent and/or focal lesions involving the callosal-septal interface (CSI). These lesions characteristically involved the inferior aspect of the callosum and radiated from the ventricular surface into the overlying callosum. CSI lesions were optimally demonstrated on sagittal long repetition time (TR)/short echo time (TE) images and frequently (45% of cases) went undetected on axial images. Only 2.4% of the control patients had lesions of the CC. The authors conclude that midsagittal long TR/short TE images are highly sensitive and specific for MS and that callosal involvement in MS is more common than previously reported.</p>
1480,2-s2.0-0025857690,Axial vs sagittal t2-weighted brain mr images in the evaluation of multiple sclerosis,"<p>Axial and sagittal proton density and T2-weighted MR images (TR 2,500-3,000 ms, TE 15-22 and 85-90 ms) were performed in 50 patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) on a 1.5 T superconductive system. The number of plaques on the axial and sagittal images in the periventricular white matter, the corpus callosum, the brain stem, the cerebellum, and the basal ganglia were counted separately by two independent observers. A total of 858 lesions (mean 17.40 ± 21.57) were seen on the axial series and 1,196 (mean 24.32 ± 26.22) on the sagittal scans. More lesions were visualized on sagittal images in the periventricular region (mean 18.79 ± 21.69 versus 13.34 ± 16.45; p &lt; 0.001) and the corpus callosum (mean 3.00 ± 2.72 versus 0.57 ± 1.19; p &lt; 0.001). In the brain stem more lesions were visualized on the axial images (mean 1.55 ± 2.55 versus 0.87 ± 1.20; p &lt; 0.05). In the cerebellum and basal ganglia, scans in the two planes were equivalent (p &gt; 0.5). In three patients lesions were seen on the sagittal series, while the axial scans were normal. Sagittal T2-weighted images appear to demonstrate significantly more MS plaques than transverse images, especially in the periventricular region and the corpus callosum. This is explained by partial volume averaging, by the orientation of some cerebral structures (e.g., corpus callosum) with regard to the section plane, and by the longer diameter of the lesions in the axial plane. © 1991 Raven Press, Ltd., New York.</p>"
1481,2-s2.0-0025403623,Patient realignment in magnetic resonance imaging of the head: an algorithm using mathematical morphology for feature extraction,"<p>To develop a technique for automatic patient realignment in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), it is essential to extract key features automatically from the various slices of the head as accurately as possible. Such features include the brain, the brain stem, the pons, the corpus callosum and the cerebellum. A feature extraction algorithm has been developed which is based on thresholding a region to a common grey level and then applying mathematical morphology to produce a binary regular region. In addition, a region-filling algorithm has been developed to obtain the complete feature. The scans derived from the T1 spin-lattice relaxation time, which are the fastest of the MRI scans, are used in patient realignment to provide highly textured images. These are difficult to segment using conventional thresholding or edge enhancement techniques due to their 'grainy' appearance, which makes it difficult to isolate key features from the other components found in the slice. We have developed a method for the accurate extraction of the corpus callosum, the cerebellum and the brain area in a sagittal scan of the head. This is carried out by selective thresholding designed to remove the low texture content and then applying morphological techniques. © 1990.</p>"

1483,2-s2.0-0024563870,Correlation of magnetic resonance imaging with neuropsychological testing in multiple sclerosis,"<p>Previous research has suggested that cerebral lesions observed on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of MS patients are clinically “silent.” We examined the validity of this assertion by correlating neuropsychological test performance with MRI findings in 53 MS patients. We used a semiautomated quantitation system to measure three MRI variables: total lesion area (TLA), ventricular-brain ratio (VBR), and size of the corpus callosum (SCC). Stepwise multiple regression analyses indicated that TLA was a robust predictor of cognitive dysfunction, particularly for measures of recent memory, abstract/ conceptual reasoning, language, and visuospatial problem solving. SCC predicted test performance on measures of mental processing speed and rapid problem solving, while VBR did not independently predict cognitive test findings. These findings suggest that cerebral lesions in MS produce cognitive dysfunction and that MRI may be a useful predictor of cognitive dysfunction. © 1989 American Academy of Neurology.</p>"

To examine this proposal, we compared the performance of 28 MS patients with significant corpus callosum atrophy (CCA) on midsagittal magnetic resonance scans, 16 MS patients without significant CCA, and 64 demographically matched normal control subjects on two laterality tasks: verbal dichotic listening (consonant-vowel syllables) and tachistiscopic object-naming latency. Results indicated that left ear suppression was found only in the MS patients with CCA. Likewise, patients in the MS group with CCA were slow in responding to stimuli presented in the left visual field; this effect was not observed in patients without CCA. These findings support the hypothesis that efficiency of cross-callosal information flow is reduced in MS patients with CCA. © 1989 American Medical Association. All rights reserved.</p>"

1487,2-s2.0-0023772513,Structural brain correlates of anterograde memory deficits in multiple sclerosis,"<p>Progressive decline of anterograde memory functions has been increasingly recognized as a frequent symptom in chronic multiple sclerosis. In order to investigate the brain structures involved, magnetic resonance imaging was performed in 20 patients. Neuropsychological assessment included the WAIS and WMS subtests information, picture completion, similarities, digit span, logical memory, and paired associate learning. All patients with severely impaired memory functions (n=5) showed bilateral lesions in the medial temporal lobe, whereas in those patients with moderate (n=10) or no measurable impairment of memory testing (n=5) either no lesions were seen in the medial temporal lobes or these lesions were restricted to one side. A post hoc cluster analysis strikingly confirmed these results. The differences could not be related to the age of the patients, the disease duration, or the level of education. Extensive lesions in the white matter of the frontal lobes, thinning and lining of the corpus callosum, and bilateral involvement of the anterior cingulate gyrus had no bearing on the neuropsychological results. These findings indicate that bilateral demyelination in the hippocampal regions is the most likely explanation for the impairment of anterograde memory in such patients. © 1988 Springer-Verlag.</p>"

MRI observations included total number and location of lesions visualized, degree of periventricular involvement, degree of degeneration of the corpus callosum, and extent of generalized parenchymal atrophy. Overall physical disability was evaluated by the Kurtzke Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) and individual symptoms were rated according to the Kurtzke Functional Systems (FS) scale. Our results suggest that MRI brain abnormalities are significantly related to the overall severity of disease, but MRI is not particularly useful to predict the presence or absence of individual symptoms. These findings do suggest that the MRI may provide useful information to monitor clinical progression of patients with MS, but the lesions visualized need not always be symptomatic nor are we sure that all symptomatic lesions, particularly in the spinal cord and optic nerves, will be visualized. © 1988.</p>"

Neuropsychological evaluation included assessment of language, memory, cognition, visuospatial skills, and depression. Significant impairment in any three areas, compatible with diagnosis of a dementia syndrome, was observed in 28% of these patients, and lesser or no cognitive impairment characterized the remaining patients. Magnetic resonance imaging was used to evaluate the number and distribution of lesions as well as the presence of cerebral atrophy and atrophy of specific anatomic structures such as the corpus callosum. Results suggest that neither the number of lesions, the distribution of lesions, nor the extent of generalized cerebral atrophy was significantly greater in demented compared with non-demented patients. The primary finding was that atrophy of the corpus callosum was significantly more extensive on MRI scans in demented patients. Although the callosum itself may not be implicated directly in the pathogenesis of dementia, the presence of callosal atrophy on MRI scans should alert the physician to the possible occurrence of dementia in patients with multiple sclerosis. © 1987, American Medical Association.

In C.S.F. proteins ranged from 35 to 66 mg/dl, gammaglobulins from 4 to 5 per cent, cells from 2.2 to 6.8 per mm<sup>3</sup> without abnormal cells. Rounded areas of enhancement were observed on CT scan in pons and right occipital lobe. Usual biological tests, abdominal echography and lymphography were normal. Death occurred 15 months after the onset of symptoms. Neuropathological examination showed: 1) a cerebral lymphoma of probable B origin with distinct masses in right occipital lobe and pontine tegmentum and a more diffuse perivascular infiltration on the left side in the amygdaloid nucleus, fourth temporal gyrus, sublenticular area, hypothalamus and in the right internal capsule; 2) multiple small clear-cut foci of demyelination with myelin-axonal dissociation bilaterally in the optic pathways, periventricular regions, corona radiata, cerebral and cerebellar white matter, sublenticular areas, temporal lobes, splenium of the corpus callosum and fornices with secondary atrophy of the mamillary bodies. Both recent and old plaques were observed. Inflammatory perivascular cuffing, when present, consisted of small nontumoral lymphocytes. The association of different types of cerebral lymphoma with various atypical leukoencephalopathies has been repeatedly reported in the literature. The association of a CNS lymphoma with multiple plaques of demyelination the distribution of which is not consistent with that of the tumor, has been already reported once and may represent more than a coincidental finding.</p>"
1495,2-s2.0-0019841049,Asymptomatic multiple sclerosis: 3 cases,"<p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) cases found at autopsy in patients who had died from other diseases and in whom no sign or symptom could be related to MS are called 'asymptomatic'. Three cases are reported. The first patient was a 62 year old man who presented with a slowly progressive disturbance of gait, incontinence and deterioration of intellectual function. A falx meningioma was surgically removed. The patient died 3 years later with an acute respiratory illness. Examination of the brain disclosed evidence of the operation and numerous old plaques disseminated through the cerebral hemispheres (centrum semi-ovale, periventricular regions, internal thalamus and junction between cortex and white matter) and in the brain stem. The second case, a 77 year old woman with diabetes mellitus and hypertension, presented with cortical blindness and disturbances of memory of acute onset. She died one year later. Examination of the brain showed multiple infarcts involving the territories of both posterior cerebral arteries and the left middle cerebral artery. Numberous old plaques were seen in the periventricular regions, in the corpus callosum and in the left middle cerebellar peduncle. The third case, a 60 year old woman with mitral and aortic stenosis, presented with cortical deafness and transient right hemiparesis. She died 5 years later. Brain examination showed infarcts involving both middle cerebral artery territories. There was also many old plaques in the periventricular areas, thalamus, internal capsule, centrum semi-ovale, brain stem and right nucleus dentatus. In the 3 cases, the optic tracts were normal. The spinal cord, examined only in the first case, was also normal. The asymptomatic character of these MS cases can be explained first by the location of the plaques and the lack of spinal cord and optic tract involvement. It could also be due to the small size of the plaques and to axonal preservation. Such features are rare since our 3 observations have been selected from a pathological collection of 125 MS cases and 9,300 general neuropathological records. Six other cases have been previously reported by other authors.</p>"

Report of three cases,"<p>Computerized tomography (CT) has made it easier to distinguish tumoral from nontumoral diseases of the central nervous system. In the presence of mass effect, however, this distinction may be difficult or impossible to make. Primary demyelinating disease may occasionally present as a focal cerebral mass. The authors report three cases of primarily demyelinating disease of the brain involving the corpus callosum and periventricular white matter and associated with mass effect, which proved difficult to differentiate from infiltrating 'butterfly' gliomas.</p>"
1497,2-s2.0-0018842477,"The influence of the ground substance on the extracellular water of normal and edematous human brain: Focal edema and the demyelinating diseases, including multiple sclerosis","<p>The presence of a ground substance in brain provides a mechanism by which edema localized to one region of the white matter might occur without spreading diffusely into the adjacent tissues. The most common such localization is the sparing of the arcuate white matter when the deeper white matter is markedly edematous. This may be related to the higher concentration of mucopolysaccharides in the former. Petechial hemorrhages in the white matter may be surrounded by a zone free of edema, although the hemorrhagic zone itself is almost certainly edematous. This, and the presence of a central zone within some of the petechiae forming a ring hemorrhage may reflect the influence of the ground substance. Focal lesions of the dorsum of the corpus callosum and similar lesions of the basal surface of the pons, these probably due to traumatization by the contiguous falx or arteries, are characterized by myelin loss and axon preservation, a characteristic of edema; the surrounding tissues are not edematous. Severe hypertension is sometimes associated with the presence of clusters of focal perivenous demyelinating lesions in the white matter, the axons being preserved. These resemble the lesions of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis and may be due to edema; they are surrounded by nonedematous white matter. It is suggested that the same concept may apply to the focal demyelinating lesions of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, multifocal leukoencephalopathy, central pontine myelinolysis and of multiple sclerosis i.e. the “true” demyelinating diseases, just as has already been suggested for diffuse sclerosis. © 1980 American Association of Neuropathologists, Inc.</p>"
1498,2-s2.0-0018727412,A search for antibodies against glial cells in the serum and cerebrospinal fluid of patients with multiple sclerosis and Guillain-Barré syndrome,"<p>We have used indirect immunofluorescence to examine the binding of immunoglobulin in sera from patients with multiple sclerosis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, other neurological diseases, and normal subjects to marker-identified glial cells in dissociated primary cell cultures of neonatal rat corpus callosum and sciatic nerve. In corpus callosum cultures all the sera tested showed weak surface staining of oligodendrocytes and of a small percentage of astrocytes and bright staining of fibroblasts. The cerebrospinal fluid from one patient with multiple sclerosis showed the same pattern of staining while the cerebrospinal fluid from other patients with multiple sclerosis and pathological controls only showed weak staining of fibroblasts. None of the sera stained the cytoplasm of oligodendrocytes in frozen sections of adult rat optic nerve. In sciatic nerve cultures all sera showed weak staining of Schwann cells and fibroblasts. Thus we were unable to distinguish patients with demyelinating diseases from normal individuals or from patients with other neurological diseases in terms of serum or cerebrospinal fluid anti-glial cell antibodies. © 1979.</p>"

Light microscopy, histochemistry, electron microscopy and morphometric analysis of counts of mitochondria, dense bodies, and pinocytotic vesicles within the capillary endothelial cells was done. Examination of the MS plaque showed endothelial cell tight junctions to be closed, basal lamina to be thinned, but endothelial cell mitochondria to be the same as in a patient without MS. Pinocytotic vesicles were markedly increased in endothelial cells in MS. Despite intense inflammation in the surround, endothelial lysosomes were as few as in a control.</p>"
1501,2-s2.0-0016788207,The neuropathology of diseases of the white matter,"<p>The diseases of white matter compose essentially three nosological entities of a heterogeneous group. The clinical and neuropathological attention has been directed to the deficiency of myelin in more or less specific patterns and distribution as the primary characteristic, and the unique natural history and the respective cellular pathology as the modifiers which define each disease. Basically, 13 diseases are cited. Current research investigations are concerned with theoretical hypotheses based on the pathology of the human diseases, etiologically proven naturally occurring animal diseases and experimentally produced animal demyelinative diseases of central and peripheral nervous system. Hypersensitivity mechanisms evoked by an immune response of the delayed type, circulating antibodies, and the possibility of viruses initiating an immune response as causative by direct or indirect effects are the key subjects today. The data are most encouraging and the research efforts are challenging. Direct evidence is lacking for any of the hypotheses of etiology of the human disorders of white matter except perhaps for the leukodystrophies and progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy.</p>"

Severe atrophy of the callosum was found in cases with marked hydrocephalus. Demyelination of the callosum varied in extent from slight involvement (with a few small plaques) to almost total myelin loss. A clinical history of mental deterioration was usual in the cases with severe callosal lesions, but no symptoms were recorded that indicated a specific disconnection syndrome. The ventricular enlargement noted in this series could not be explained either on the basis of obstruction to the flow of cerebrospinal fluid, or by the effects of shrinkage of the white matter.</p>"

1506,2-s2.0-0015745747,Two unusual neuropathologically proven cases of multiple sclerosis from bombay,"<p>Two unusual cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), both from Bombay, have been reported with detailed clinical and histopathological findings, which evidenced dissemination in time and in space. They were both women in their twenties, with total duration of the neurological illness of 5-6 months. The first patient had initial signs related to the optic nerves and then, after remission, to the brain stem and spinal cord. There were chronic plaques in the medulla, in 1 optic nerve and lesions of varying stages throughout the cervical spinal cord, with glial cellular and fibrillar reaction, and some preservation of axons. This appeared to be a case of MS with features simulating neuromyelitis optica. The second patient had initial signs related to the lumbar cord, like a transverse myelitis and then, after a remission, evidence of a progressive cerebral disorder with clinical and ventriculographic findings suggesting a space-occupying lesion in the corpus callosum and frontal lobes. The more chronic demyelination was in the spinal cord. The brain showed large, recent, symmetrical, periventricular plaques, with total absence of myelin except in some of the U-fibres, throughout the frontal and parietal lobes and anterior corpus callosum. There was moderate lymphocytic reaction in and around the vessels, extensive accumulation of myelin breakdown products in histiocytes (gemistocytes and gitter cells) with some preservation of axons and early gliosis. This appeared to be a case of MS with some features of diffuse cerebral sclerosis, or what is often called transitional type of MS. A history of smallpox vaccination 5 weeks before the illness in the first case, and the chronic inflammatory reaction in the second, together with the rapid tempo of the disease in both, which determined the characteristic patterns of clinical and pathological changes, has led us to discuss the infectious and allergic hypotheses of aetiology in MS. © 1973.</p>"

1508,2-s2.0-0014791756,LIPIDS AND PROTEINS IN MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS WHITE MATTER,"<p>Abstract— Quantitative analyses of white matter from four brains of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) and four control brains were carried out for total and soluble proteins, individual lipid fractions, and their corresponding fatty acids. In three specimens from two of the MS brains there were reductions of cerebrosides and of the C<sub>20:1</sub> acid in the ethanolamine glycerophosphatide (EGP) fraction and a slight increase of tetraenes and trienes, while all other components were present in concentrations similar to those in the controls. In three other samples from two of the MS brains, galactolipids were deficient to a greater extent than cholesterol, EGP or CGP (choline glycerophosphatide), while proteins were within the control range. In samples where thinning of myelin was observed in Luxol‐blue stained sections, there were proportional decreases of all components. The percentage of C<sub>20:1</sub> acid in the EGP fraction was reduced in two of three myelin preparations from corresponding samples of MS white matter, and that of C<sub>24:1</sub> acid in the cerebroside fraction was reduced in all three MS myelin preparations when compared with the two controls. The data suggest that inadequacy of the fatty acid elongation process together with deficits of cerebrosides represent one of the early biochemical lesions in the white matter of the MS brain.
